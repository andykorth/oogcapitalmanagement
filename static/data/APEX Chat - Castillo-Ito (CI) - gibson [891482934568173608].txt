**PiBoy314**:	Hello


[26-Sep-21 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We have 162k in the bank. We collected around 100k each week in taxes, now taxes have been cut to around 2/3 what they were, so we expect ~70k in taxes. This balances with our POPI upkeep which comes out to around 60k a week.

**Raiga_**:	just curious


[28-Sep-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	if i read the manual correct to build ships we need a planet with a shipyard thats a community project we dind't have it on Gibson in the moment


[28-Sep-21 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Raiga_**:	i know


[28-Sep-21 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Woden**:	I am voting Piboy as well, though I am curious, are you doing anything to prevent Gibson seeing the worker shortages we see on other planets?


[01-Oct-21 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We're smaller than the other planets, and currently have 15% pioneer unemployment, 36% settler unemployment, and will reach full employment on TEC next week. Generally, I don't think it will be a concern for us. Now if a new player wave hits, models suggest that it could become a problem. In that case, another SST or INF may be needed, but current models suggest that with the current trend, no more infrastructure is needed.


[01-Oct-21 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	Good, I am glad you have it in hand


[01-Oct-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Hey all - I've changed my CoGC vote from Construction to Metallurgy, and I'd encourage everyone here to consider doing the same.


[06-Oct-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	My reasons:


[06-Oct-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	PP1 prices are falling - we're near the point now where producing UPS at a FS is more cost productive than further saturating the market with BFabs


[06-Oct-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	At the same time, both FE and AL prices on the CX are still very high. Lots of boats are moving back and forth between the CX and Gibson


[06-Oct-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I think we'd all be better off here producing cheaper FE/AL, and building UTS (not UPS) to sell for currency.


[06-Oct-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	SME/FS/GF/HWF -we don't have any of enough of these in BEN space. But there are lots of BFabs

***Gshock** joined.*


[07-Oct-21 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I have no problem with amplifying my number of smelters to a full base's worth.. Or two permits worth depending, but climbing the ladder on the required prefabs for habitation and the actual smelters themselves is a little slow going.


[07-Oct-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I think we're 100% better off producing cheap B-fabs. The FE and AL markets are only so high because there's very little demand for them on the market (at least FE). Partly because they're heavy to ship, partly because all the big BBH and BSE production is done on FE rich worlds. A PP1 employs 80 PIO, keeping them most efficient is the key to making the most profit off the construction line up.


[07-Oct-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	So vote Construction for COGC


[07-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Efficient metallurgy will _still_ support cheap BFabs (more FE!) AND it will support a bunch of other industries.


[07-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	So - Vote Metallurgy for CoGC :)


[07-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	In related news - 470 is now too high for FE.CI1 for me. I've posted buy ads at 400


[07-Oct-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Since a vertical construction base is roughly 1:1 PP1 to SME, having a construction COGC for PP1 (employing 80 PIO vs 50 on the SME) gives you more output for less cost than a metallurgy COGC because you have to employ few PIO to make the same amount (or more realistically, make more with the same amount of PIO)

[07-Oct-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'm going to need to invest in moving my headquarters into NEO space to get their bonus if I honestly intend to fill this metal role.


[07-Oct-21 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The overall efficiency change is the same for the collection of bases. And since expert bonuses are symmetric across industries, they offer the same thing as the COGC. You benefit more from construction experts. Although RE experts are a close second because of the EXT, COL, and INC required

[12-Oct-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Oct-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Not sure how the water situation goes.. Nemesis has a much better water amount though.. and better fertility


[12-Oct-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Oct-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArtOfDao**:	Wondering if you have any advice / need for someone specialising in PE production?


[13-Oct-21 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArtOfDao**:	Currently (as a lone wolf) it seems the most efficient to ship it to Moria despite the NCC exchanges needed...


[13-Oct-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	Hey :) nice to have you here. When shipping, you always need to take the Fuel costs into calculation. Most times its only worth, if you also bring stuff back, which you can sell here with a great enough profit


[13-Oct-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArtOfDao**:	I did factor in two-way trip fuel costs and it still made more sense (provided I can actually exchange the NCC favourably). Thanks for the tip - once I get a greater surplus of funds, I'll for sure find some commodities to bring back :)


[13-Oct-21 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArtOfDao**:	Currently, I have weekly trips planned, and I'd be happy to ferry up to 400 m3 of anything you might need to get there or back ;)


[13-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	thank you for the offer. i dont know if you are connected to the different discord servers, but it would be worth to mention your shipping there to reach a broader audience

[24-Oct-21 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	A single term is 15 days, correct?


[24-Oct-21 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I have a soft spot for Saganaki, so if they run I won't oppose them, but if someone more unknown runs, I'll support them since Saganaki is already a well known member of the community.


[24-Oct-21 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	28 days I believe


[24-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HogginDoss**:	I would be down to give it a go, but now is a pretty crazy time at work. I would be interested in about a month once things calm down


[24-Oct-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	@PiBoy314: Agreed.  I'll stop running if somebody else wants to take the reigns


[24-Oct-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It's improbable that I'll have all 5 HAB ready by the time the term ends, but if that's not the case, it'll be up to the next governor to finish it


[24-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I think they're in production and it is >10 days until the end of the term, so it is possible the next governor will have a PAR on their hands


[24-Oct-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	@mjewkes: I don't have the time to investigate that, but if necessary, FIOC has PAR/SOI capabilities I could see about tapping.  I'll defer to PiBoy.

**Taiyi**:	Hello Gibsonites! Since PiBoy is stepping down I'll be running for governor (again). My goals are to establish a solid population of TEC and hopefully start on educating some ENG. Since PiBoy314 built a solid financial foundation we should see some success in doing so. I will continue to advocate for Construction CoGC since Gibson is the prime constructor planet in the CI-region.

**PiBoy314**:	Not currently. I've bought some OFF to feed the SST, although PIO and SET are doing just fine, and TEC are getting there.


[03-Nov-21 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I can help with cheaper off I think in future, I got a HAL mine :)


[03-Nov-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	we would get better growth for techs if there was a bigger settlers population thou I see those are barely employed


[03-Nov-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Correct. Not much I can do about that, it's futile to fight unemployment at this scale.


[03-Nov-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	In the future you'll have to talk to Taiyi, although I'm guessing they'll still choose to get OFF internally, since it's quite cheap

[10-Nov-21 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	there is no possible possessiveness relation in that sentence so apart from wanting to point out mistypes I don't get the confusion it's pretty logical


[10-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	there's not that many english speakers out there anyway to expect perfect grammar or perfect typing skills :D


[10-Nov-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-21 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	we won't get any migration growth while under 70% happiness and education growth for techs is way too low since it's % from settlers base

[10-Nov-21 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I think a partial solution(in addition to a Park) is to get the safety station up. It's safety that is the dragging factor atm


[10-Nov-21 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	We're at level 1. Prox is at 6. Etherwind, ETHERWIND is at 2.


[10-Nov-21 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I would like to question as to WTF the governor is doing with all the taxes/fees. To have our safety station be completely empty of all supplies is unacceptable.


[10-Nov-21 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Pinged our HAB producer about when the HAB will be ready. Should be soon-ish, remember it takes 10 days to make a set


[10-Nov-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The answer to why POPI wasn't built up before the change in governorship: It really isn't needed. We do need to fill this SST, and arguably make a second, but we don't really need anything beyond that if we want to just get a few ENG


[10-Nov-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	I have been running the numbers and with a fully supplied SST we should achieve ~88% safety. I conclude that a second level is necessary. All the required fabs are going to come in this week. Thanks to @Rwinner16 for donating DW to the SST. OFF and SUN are on their way.


[11-Nov-21 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	A second level of SST should be plenty unless we have a rapid population growth.


[11-Nov-21 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	heh, I'm a bit more concerned about Techs, while my pp3's are kinda uncrewed mostly if more people open tech jobs without having achieved >70 happiness it's going to only be deterioration costs sadly


[11-Nov-21 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but yeah 4 weeks to build 5 HAB's is a bit too much, I didn't know it would take that much otherwsie I would have gotten a BRM planet and do it myself locally and then scrap the planet


[11-Nov-21 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Safety will help the techs grow. Since they are currently capped by that.


[11-Nov-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I actually own half of the techs at this point so I could have paid and made the PAR much faster as I have direct interest in it


[11-Nov-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Furthermore with the PAR coming up the Techs will get a decent boost


[11-Nov-21 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah so pls keep me posted on further developements as I have high interest in pop growth here and I can help


[11-Nov-21 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	and I don't really care about getting my hand in the cookie jar of the gov tax money but I do care about having workers in my plants so I don't mind providing or helping acquire some more laborious popi parts

[14-Nov-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-21 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	one operation? Second


[15-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Production fee is 11.11 CIS, and it produces 7 FEO

[15-Nov-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Nov-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	If a lot of people are expanding it's fine, but if for any reason it slows down the price crashes


[15-Nov-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	Here is to hoping people will expand at an exponential rate


[15-Nov-21 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	And to the myriad of metallurgists that awill become filthy rich if that happens.


[15-Nov-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I think it'll be a new normal since the established players are all converting more towards PP2s and 3s.


[15-Nov-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-21 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I mean without culture/education the max that tech happiness can go is 90%? ( 85% from needs + 5% from jobs ) ?

[16-Nov-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	How do you get 5% from jobs?


[16-Nov-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	I was thinking that 0% unemployment would equate to 85% happiness.


[16-Nov-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	And then unemployment % is added on top


[16-Nov-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	came to that conclusion because I notice on other planets with 100% safety and health they had max 75% and safety + health on techs is 0.65


[16-Nov-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but you're right, I forgot life support


[16-Nov-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
***adriankemp** joined.*


[16-Nov-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	it's 0.15 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.65


[16-Nov-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so unemployment is 0.1


[16-Nov-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so with jobs but no confort max would be 0.75 as I noticed


[16-Nov-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	you can observe that in umbra


[16-Nov-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so with confort we would be 0.95


[16-Nov-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	According to this https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/ the 5 needs sum up to 1. And after that the unemployment is added in top

[16-Nov-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah but was trying to figure out how high can it get with jobs and confort


[16-Nov-21 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	there's no info about open jobs happ boost


[16-Nov-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@aldin if enough open jobs are present it’s 30% the need fulfillment happiness. So multiply by 1.3


[16-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It’s listed in more detail under the unemployment section of that page. Let me know if you have more questions


[16-Nov-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	So Max TEC with no comfort is 0.65*1.3=.845


[16-Nov-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	With comfort, 0.85*1.3>1, so 100% happiness


[16-Nov-21 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well it's confusing since unemployment means lack of open jobs not open jobs


[16-Nov-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but if is 30% then why isn't happiness growing over 75%? look at Umbra it has in past good needs fullfillment and happiness didn't go over 75%


[16-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	if your assumption that 30% is the open jobs benefit then it would have been 0.65*1.3 = 0.845 which was not the case as happiness didn't go over 75%


[16-Nov-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but too much calculation, we will see


[16-Nov-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Because you don’t have maximum open jobs bonus


[16-Nov-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	There are only 161 jobs open out of 1700 or so TEC. Not the 30% you need to get the cap


[16-Nov-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well there's the average happiness also in formula


[16-Nov-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That too, but the numbers line up exactly even with that


[16-Nov-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	for now would be nice if we get migration in for techs that would help and allow ppl drop more tech buildings


[16-Nov-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Look at LS-300c, until comfort came in TEC happiness stuck at 84.5%


[16-Nov-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	is culture worth it?


[16-Nov-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Probably not


[16-Nov-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Upkeep is expensive and the benefit isn’t huge for TEC or ENG


[16-Nov-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But it’s not up to me


[16-Nov-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	problem is park will give 2500 comfort and 51k pios are exactly that


[16-Nov-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	does that mean we will be around 80-90% if we fully supply it?


[16-Nov-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	92.4% to be more exact


[16-Nov-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	do I have to take a BRM planet?


[16-Nov-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	How many TEC are you looking at employing? We should see a good boost in TEC numbers with the incoming PAR and some upkeep there.


[16-Nov-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Remember that every percent over 70% results in a net growth. So no need to stay at 100%


[16-Nov-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	around 300 techs and 90 eng I would say down the road


[16-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	eventually :D


[16-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	construction only I would say but if cogc changes spec I would probably move also


[16-Nov-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	TEC should be accounted for with a PAR. Might need to look at some more POPI to reach 90 ENG in a reasonable time


[16-Nov-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah we need a good tec base to even dream about eng first then can just make a uni or something


[16-Nov-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	depends how many constructors we attract

[18-Nov-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	it's only scaled for our team purposes at the moment but if there are any interested parties let us know


[18-Nov-21 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	Yeah I noticed, I was kinda dreaming of doing the same


[18-Nov-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Iridium**:	probably on a weekly basis


[18-Nov-21 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	we can expand the mine I think and charge a resonable price depending on consumable price but transporting from there might be an issue :D


[18-Nov-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Nov-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I meant viable in the sense of minimizing costs. Fuel, repairs, etc.. A bigger cargo hold makes the costs easier to absorb


[18-Nov-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Since it's split between a much larger amount of product.


[18-Nov-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Hi Shenpster. Nice to have you here on Gibson. If you want to stay competitive being a Victualler you might consider starting out on Nemesis. They have a much better fertility and H2O concentration.


[19-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	If you want to stay here you can consider making Carbon or smelting some Iron since Gibson is better suited for that.


[19-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Woden**:	If you open the buildings tab from the base buffer you should be able to see the amount of reclaimable matierals for each building

[26-Nov-21 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	of course you need to add fuel costs to your calc, but if you can make profit with goods for sell an ANT and return with another product to make profit again on BEN, then the trade route will make profit overall for sure

[08-Dec-21 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	does demolishing buildings affect the whole planet?


[08-Dec-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	limited workforce


[08-Dec-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well the population is split between all consumers so if there isn't enough you'll have job efficieny loss


[08-Dec-21 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	and population consumers are the industries


[08-Dec-21 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so I went from 104% to 148% that's gigantic


[08-Dec-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	also built a HB4 to get the engineers happier :P


[08-Dec-21 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	This place needs more locally sold batches of rations and drinking water.


[08-Dec-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	it's a construction planet :D


[08-Dec-21 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I don't doubt, but food could be sold.


[08-Dec-21 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	If there were batches I'd buy em here in bunches of 100


[08-Dec-21 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Maybe next week though since I already sent a ship to Benten to make sales


[08-Dec-21 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you put up an ad, there's a chance it would be filled


[08-Dec-21 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Yeah but my license lapsed so I don't have that 'luxury' anymore


[08-Dec-21 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I can fill orders, I can't make them


[08-Dec-21 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'll have a ship at Benten, I'll let people know how much extra room I have available in case someone needs something stupidly large brought back


[08-Dec-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	Seeing that everyone is already doing construction I actually turned my base to a food manufacturing one. i've been selling rations here and there but im new. so my output speed is no where need the current demand


[08-Dec-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	near*


[08-Dec-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	locally


[08-Dec-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	im spitting out 30 rations abd 7 DW every 24 hour.


[08-Dec-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	:D


[08-Dec-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	considerable for your size but we eat lot


[08-Dec-21 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	im going to have to expand. just out of curiosuty. @Aldin how many RAT and DW do you consume each day?


[08-Dec-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	on this base or on all bases?


[08-Dec-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i also want to know what is your consumption rate @PiBoy and @MagnusFaustus. Just out of curiosity.


[08-Dec-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	just in Gibson Ebisu


[08-Dec-21 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I'm also a quite new player and have 31 DW and 32 RAT per day


[08-Dec-21 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	wow, how do you manage that?


[08-Dec-21 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	buy from CX most time


[08-Dec-21 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well, this is my HQ now so all stuff gets hauled here and distributed but around 40 dw and 30 rat


[08-Dec-21 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	god damn.....my production rate is no where near the demand locally....


[08-Dec-21 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yeah, it needs time until you're able to grow faster


[08-Dec-21 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	start is really slow here


[08-Dec-21 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i started the game building everything and shipping contract everywhere. then i realized I messed up. I was able to get my ship back home, but one ship now is currently stranded.


[08-Dec-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	92 dw, 96 rat


[08-Dec-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	now currently producing food and selling locally to get my ship back.


[08-Dec-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	thank you for the data @Efca


[08-Dec-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	what do you need for your other ship to get it back? some fuel?


[08-Dec-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	lol yea


[08-Dec-21 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	how much and where?


[08-Dec-21 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	well, thankfully its in benten


[08-Dec-21 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	and its has 0 stl and 0 ftl

**Shenpster**:	completely empty


[08-Dec-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	:D


[08-Dec-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i had to transfer its own fuel to my other ship.


[08-Dec-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	such a waste to keep ships idle


[08-Dec-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	ah okay, so you just need some money to refill the other one?


[08-Dec-21 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	yea, currently im sitting at 5906 CIS


[08-Dec-21 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	why don't you do one of the many big shipping contracts. Just accept one and ask the plazer to pay in advance. many will accept and you get 10k per contract


[08-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	then refill with that money and fulfill the contract. try to search some fitting contract and you'll earn a lot of money with that ship


[08-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	ive been keeping my eye out for those, but I've never seen a 10k contract.


[08-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	https://fio.fnar.net/shipmentfinder


[08-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	just sort with most payout first


[08-Dec-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	....what is this?


[08-Dec-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	there are a lot of 10k to 12k contracts available


[08-Dec-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Dec-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	FIO is a helpful tool and you can find big shiptments ads everywhere


[08-Dec-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	oh my god...you opened a new world to me


[08-Dec-21 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	hmm but it needs an origin or destination


[08-Dec-21 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	no, you can just hit search all


[08-Dec-21 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	without enter origin or destination


[08-Dec-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	doesn't work button is grey


[08-Dec-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	then you find all and can sort by payout. of course you need to calculate your own logistic and fuel costs to select routes with profit and sometime there're good options also for retun routes


[08-Dec-21 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	not that I would do any shipping thou, I am way too big to afford having idle ships


[08-Dec-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	yea when searching all, you need a destination regardless. but still a neat tool


[08-Dec-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	what do you do with your ships Aldin?


[08-Dec-21 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	If it doesn't work, just put a * into the field


[08-Dec-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	ah that did it, thnx


[08-Dec-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	np


[08-Dec-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I got 10 bases, my ships supply them ;)


[08-Dec-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I leave now, just try it Shenpster. It helped me a lot at the beginning to grow faster. Bye for now, have to work ;)


[08-Dec-21 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	thank you so much


[08-Dec-21 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	and damn...Moria station has got it going on.


[08-Dec-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	@Shenpster my consumption rate for my 450 pioneers is 18 units DW/ 18 units basic rations a day.


[08-Dec-21 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	So 100 units lasts me about 5 days


[08-Dec-21 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	thank you for the data @MagnusFaustus


[08-Dec-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Okay, i've collected my goods at Benten.


[08-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I have 300 tons of weight, or 410 m3 space on my ship. So if anybody has some things they want shipped back, post some orders.


[08-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Benten -> Gibson


[08-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	oh i have some...


[08-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'll wait 8 hours


[08-Dec-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	posted


[08-Dec-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	on gibson local


[08-Dec-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	That's asmall order.


[08-Dec-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	You shipping pens and paper in that?


[08-Dec-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	yes, just some padded work overall. my base operation is not big enough to warrant big shipping orders yet.


[08-Dec-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Still a negligible increase in space, I refilled my fuel tanks so I think I have more than I said earlier


[08-Dec-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	327.96 t / 429.38 m3


[08-Dec-21 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'll wait on more orders before setting out


[08-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	That's anything Benten -> Gibsons shipping orders. I have a lot of empty space.


[08-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	*Gibson


[08-Dec-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	@Magnus Would you ship around 137t for me?


[08-Dec-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Of course


[08-Dec-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	500cis ok?


[08-Dec-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Just advertise on Gibson and I'll try to pick it up.. 5 cis a ton? Or near enough, fine


[08-Dec-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	ok, put it for 600


[08-Dec-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	thanks


[08-Dec-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	191.46 tons remaining.


[08-Dec-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Lotta volume though, 378 m3


[08-Dec-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Yeah mine is some LST, only weight but not volume


[08-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	usually I try to fly ores together with gases, but my ship will arrive late from Ementior and I need to avoid that production will stop


[08-Dec-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Fair enough, I'm carrying some limestone to keep my Prefab factory running


[08-Dec-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'll wait another 4-5 hours for more orders


[08-Dec-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Halstead** left.*


[08-Dec-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Ben cx?


[08-Dec-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I'll take everything you have left.


[08-Dec-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Everything?


[08-Dec-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Well let me know when you have the order ready to go up


[08-Dec-21 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Still have 191.46 tons and 378 m3


[08-Dec-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yeah. Be home in 10. Will get ad up


[08-Dec-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	Hey @RWinner16. whats your RAT and DW consumption rate at Ebisu Gibson?


[08-Dec-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	Daily workforce consumption


[08-Dec-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	that's not so important :) do some C I'll buy it :p


[08-Dec-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	just gathering data to gauge how much do i need to grow to become a sucessful food supplier for the local planet.


[08-Dec-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I got like 5k rats lying around but struggle to keep PG production up on umbra


[08-Dec-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	pretty much everyone will aim to get their own rat/dw production once they develop I think so the RAT / DW market is a good entry point in initial developement stages but prices vary quite lot, I would aim for a prefab industry also because it makes developement cheaper


[08-Dec-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	ok


[08-Dec-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I usually do like 3 FRM, 2 PP1 on rat and sell excess then a sme, pp1


[08-Dec-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i am also thinking of producing Carbon in the near future


[08-Dec-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I would buy C


[08-Dec-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	correction 3 FRM, 2 FP's on RAT


[08-Dec-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	how many rigs do you have?


[08-Dec-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	RIG


[08-Dec-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	0 it's cheap enough to import it


[08-Dec-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	so would it mean you would buy H2O?


[08-Dec-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah it's 16/u atm and when you go to station you can buy few hundreds to last you for months if you run 3 farms


[08-Dec-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	how much space in base you have developed?


[08-Dec-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i have....only Gibson and its 107/500 with 1/3 permits


[08-Dec-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	how much for the ad from Ben to Gib?


[08-Dec-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Nominal rates, ~5 CIS a ton, or the like.. it's mostly to cover fuel costs


[08-Dec-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	want it in CIS or NCC


[08-Dec-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	oh, didnt know theres norminal rates for shipping, i hope i given enough...


[08-Dec-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	ad is up


[08-Dec-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	building first base is the most difficult task after that it will go much faster


[08-Dec-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I put the ad on Gibson LM, not BEN LM. Fees go to our planet that way


[08-Dec-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Right, topped up


[08-Dec-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	No more room so I'm on the move


[08-Dec-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	appreciate it!


[08-Dec-21 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Least this way I can do useful things as long as my license is in 'basic'


[09-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	thank you Magnus for the delivery


[09-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Any DW up for sale on Gibson?


[09-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i have only 10 DW for now


[09-Dec-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Fair nuff, I'm in the market for 100 or so


[09-Dec-21 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	would you be willing to buy my 10 DW for 280 CIS? special price just for you. lol


[09-Dec-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i would have 34 units of DW for sell in about 5 hours though.


[09-Dec-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	oh i mean 24


[09-Dec-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'm not in a *terrific* rush for the DW. I have about 4 days worth, but by that point I'm probably going to need a bit more than a hundred


[09-Dec-21 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	i'll sell whatever I have, I definitely wont be able to hit the number you want though.


[09-Dec-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'll buy what you have until I have more if you like, it'd give me a little buffer. Although I'd suggest you sell larger batches since the add-posting costs are constant. Smaller amounts really chew into your profit margins.


[09-Dec-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	*ad posting


[09-Dec-21 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	yea, see you in 4 days lol

**Aldin**:	does someone have HB4's there? I am confused why open jobs appeared for engineers before I had a HB4 up, like last week


[14-Dec-21 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so if anyone housed engineers pls raise hand :)


[14-Dec-21 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	actually in the last month, had a debate that PP4 had open jobs for engineers without a HB4 present


[14-Dec-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	while AML needs a HB4 to show open jobs in POPR


[14-Dec-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Hm. That would be strange, I haven't observed that to be the case with any other building.


[14-Dec-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Corlis may be able to comment more on that


[14-Dec-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I built my PP4 last month and it showed up in next POPR without anyone having a engineer house


[14-Dec-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Someone probably put up a PP4 and HB4 the week prior


[14-Dec-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well you can look in the popr log a month ago we barely had techs


[14-Dec-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	What day did you put up your HB4?


[14-Dec-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I was the first to drop a pp4

**PiBoy314**:	Right, but when did your HB4 go up?


[14-Dec-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	that accounts exactly for report #36

[14-Dec-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	:D


[14-Dec-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	you can see a new PP4 was dropped in last report and I bet Tayiyi has no HB4 or other eng habitation either


[14-Dec-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	just a wild guess since it's not and will not be useful for a very very long time to house the engineers here


[14-Dec-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	1 eng/week is pitiful


[14-Dec-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If someone else had 1 HB4 and 1 PP4, built the HB4 before report 36, and then before report 40 you build a HB4 and they build a PP4. And that produces the results we see


[14-Dec-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	doubt it, in before I dropped bunch of pp3's here nobody had any interest in growing techs here


[14-Dec-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	let alone house engineers but ok it could be an explanation the one you provided


[14-Dec-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so you say the last week report open jobs visibility are actually mine


[14-Dec-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	and someone else built a PP4/HB4 coincidentally in same week as I did 1month and 5days ago


[14-Dec-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I can confirm Taiyi built a HB4 on November 7th


[14-Dec-21 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And a PP4 concurrently


[14-Dec-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Right, we saw your 30 pop onto the report last week


[14-Dec-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I see, then that makes sense :D


[14-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	So housing is mandatory for open jobs to count, sad


[14-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep


[14-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	we will never get scientists


[14-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No, we will probably never get scientists


[14-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Not on Gibson at least


[14-Dec-21 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	need to invest in Proxion then :)


[14-Dec-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep. We haven't put in the millions necessary to get SCI up and running


[14-Dec-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	last universe I built alone 2 lvl of university on Prom-C to calculate the growth factor, was fun


[14-Dec-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	leaving that aside I put some PFE in queue but will reach later so no need to buy it for now got like 100 in queue


[14-Dec-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Circe has shown that if you really want to, a large group of players can decide to grow SCI on any planet


[14-Dec-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'm also shipping FOD down from Nemesis to feed the PAR


[14-Dec-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	don't need large, just one player to fill 3 licenses with LAB's


[14-Dec-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I wonder how many tech jobs that will open


[14-Dec-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	answer is 27 LAB, 19 HB3 and 1900 techs and wastes 3 licenses :D


[14-Dec-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so you really need like 2 people with a powerful economy that can afford to waste 3-ish licenses or split among more players :)


[14-Dec-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And then you need a lot of POPI to get needs and education constants up


[14-Dec-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Circe has 4 UNI, which is crazy


[14-Dec-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But SNF is big


[14-Dec-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	it's easier when pio pop is low because they don't use much infrastructure


[14-Dec-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	if for example 400 players would join there and spam pio buildings their infra would collapse fast :D


[14-Dec-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	pesky peasants have so many needs


[14-Dec-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but yeah lvl4 UNI lol


[14-Dec-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I'm happy we managed to get a few techs on Gibson so that my pp3's don't run at 30% anymore :D

**Taiyi**:	PP4 is now 38 days old. First PP3 went up 195 days ago ;)


[15-Dec-21 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	HB4 has been up as soon as the PP4 went up


[15-Dec-21 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah your pp4 and Hb4 went up same time and it confused me, thought it was mine that showed up on the open jobs panel

**Shenpster**:	just looking at the past convo....is building a HB4 or HB5 a big deal for the whole planet?


[15-Dec-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	It was important to get the happiness of the respective population up


[15-Dec-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	and to do that, we need to build cultural buildings like universities?


[15-Dec-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well looking at engineers +1/week is kinda hopeless but it helps in long run


[15-Dec-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	happiness grows from 2 things, open jobs and necessities fullfilled


[15-Dec-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	currently in the population report, there are 4 enginners. with 61.8% happiness


[15-Dec-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	UNIs will help to get Engineers more quickly


[15-Dec-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	all population summed up has some needs, if those are fullfilled then their happiness goes up


[15-Dec-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Mostly a bigger TEC population is needed to get more Engineers


[15-Dec-21 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah engineers grow only being educate from technicians while Pio, Settlers, Techs can grow also as result of migration


[15-Dec-21 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	do you think we csan ever get scientists?


[15-Dec-21 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Basically you want Open jobs first and then the governor can look into supplying needs via Pop infrastructure to push growth in certain areas


[15-Dec-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	dam....this game is much deeper than i though. good luck being governor lol


[15-Dec-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	with out techs levels probably no sci will ever grow here


[15-Dec-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I mean without a big tech population


[15-Dec-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Unlikely to see scientists any time soon without massive investment into jobs and education buildings


[15-Dec-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We would also need some education infrastructure. It’s impossible without any (zero growth rate)


[15-Dec-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	and as a small company like me, i can contirbute materials to build these infastructure i guess


[15-Dec-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I didn't save my notes from last round but I think sci education level without education buildings was like 0.05% or less


[15-Dec-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Current tax levels are enough to support the current population quite fine. Higher Level pop would need separate investment from the larger companies


[15-Dec-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	or was it 0.5%?


[15-Dec-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Aldin we confirmed that it’s 0% exactly without education infrastructure


[15-Dec-21 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	oh man, universities have upkeeps?! damn


[15-Dec-21 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	but you don’t need to upkeep them to get the education growth benefit


[15-Dec-21 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	what? no, we had sci last round without education buildings


[15-Dec-21 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Yeah universities can sit unsupplied and still give the benefit


[15-Dec-21 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Alsin no? Where?


[15-Dec-21 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	on Prom-C


[15-Dec-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Oh, last UNI?


[15-Dec-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	last universe?


[15-Dec-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yes


[15-Dec-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	we had +1 sci at around 400 or 500 eng I don't recall exactly


[15-Dec-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’m pretty sure you have to have education infrastructure. But I have the reports so I can check


[15-Dec-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shenpster**:	does universe ever get reset?


[15-Dec-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	because this universe it’s definitely 0%


[15-Dec-21 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	you get the 30% from jobs plus needs


[15-Dec-21 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	and if it gets to 70% you get growth


[15-Dec-21 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	and a sci can get to 70% without education if all needs are supplied + jobs = 91%


[15-Dec-21 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but I think it's somehow capped at 75%, I think was 0.2% or 0.25%


[15-Dec-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	What’s capped?


[15-Dec-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah 0.2% cause we had a sci at around 500 engineers


[15-Dec-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Withiut education, happiness is indeed limited to 70% without jobs and 91% with


[15-Dec-21 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You had 2 UNI on CR-409e


[15-Dec-21 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	*c


[15-Dec-21 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	capped means that it might be limited to a certain percentage


[15-Dec-21 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	What’s limited I mean


[15-Dec-21 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	happiness


[15-Dec-21 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No? It’s not capped at 75%?


[15-Dec-21 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I saw some planets with full health and safety and open jobs but happiness never grew over 75%


[15-Dec-21 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	for tech I mean


[15-Dec-21 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	where by the formula it was supposed to go up to 84.5%


[15-Dec-21 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Capped at 84.5% this universe


[15-Dec-21 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	do you have an example?


[15-Dec-21 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I think was patched several times also, if you look at umbra


[15-Dec-21 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	5 months ago it had 90% from open jobs so it was lowered


[15-Dec-21 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	report 16 on Umbra is even 95%


[15-Dec-21 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Right. They capped the benefit that open jobs could give early in this universe.


[15-Dec-21 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	when was the website claiming 30% boost updated?


[15-Dec-21 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	When was the website updated or when was PrUn updated to include the 30% cap?


[15-Dec-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	you assume the person maintaining the website knows about changes before they happen?


[15-Dec-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yep


[15-Dec-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'm the one who maintains that


[15-Dec-21 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	so is it accurate with the latest information which was introduced in Prun several months ago?


[15-Dec-21 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	As far as I know, it's up to date for anything after ~October when the safety and health debuffs to bases hit


[15-Dec-21 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Pretty much. Partial migration is still mentioned, even though it doesn't happen. Along with a couple of bugs that should probably be mentioned.


[15-Dec-21 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I think when Umbra showed 90% TEC happiness was before the patch


[15-Dec-21 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	the sad part is that they never published exact numbers so how did you find out the formula? inside information or reverse engineering based on obersved data?


[15-Dec-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Reverse engineering


[15-Dec-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah I remember was before patch cause I cried :D


[15-Dec-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Pi did a bunch of regression analysis


[15-Dec-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And luckily, the devs chose really nice numbers.


[15-Dec-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	^.^


[15-Dec-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well if the formula is good then 91% it is


[15-Dec-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	quite high still tbh


[15-Dec-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	I'll help we get some education infra but later bit need to finish my electro chain


[15-Dec-21 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If we want anything on Gibson, a UNI would probably be the way to go


[15-Dec-21 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Would boost ENG growth rate by 40%


[15-Dec-21 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	after I finish my electro chain I got 2 pp4's that can be dedicated to that not much use for em otherwise


[15-Dec-21 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but inputs are a bit of a headache sometimes


[15-Dec-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep. Don't need those for the 40% benefit, and you'd need a culture building before you could take advantage of feeding it inputs


[15-Dec-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	yeah will be the unmanned university of Gibson :D


[15-Dec-21 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	nobody studies there but Einsteins pop out lol


[15-Dec-21 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	We could consider running a fundraiser for a Gibson UNI


[15-Dec-21 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	well I have no money, I just build stuff


[15-Dec-21 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	in ~7days-ish I can queue stuff and finish all the A-fabs I need for a while so can put some to cook for a UNI


[15-Dec-21 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	LOG and BMF should be fairly easy to acquire. LU is a problem though


[15-Dec-21 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-21 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Efca**:	how much you got?


[22-Jan-22 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	According to my production chains right now, I think I have 50-60 overflow I need to dispense with


[22-Jan-22 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	So just over the amount I can ship out.. not that shipping it out is ideal for the fuel costs.


[22-Jan-22 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	I'll buy it but tell me how much? 300 ok?


[22-Jan-22 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Understandable on Gibson, lots of growing foundries here.


[22-Jan-22 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	go buy my alo on KW-358b and run real foundries :P


[22-Jan-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	it's probably cheaper than extracting feo on gibson but I only do 360u/day


[22-Jan-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Possibly. But there'd be other costs involved. I'll have to speculate when I have myself more secure financially


[22-Jan-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	20 parsecs


[22-Jan-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	2jumps, cheaper than Antares


[22-Jan-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'll need to look at the production chains that aluminum supports.. Been in iron so long and all that


[22-Jan-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Plus account for the damage of doing a landing, and a takeoff from that planet


[22-Jan-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	I see but just generally trying to sell cheap ALO / LST wanted let people know


[22-Jan-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Yeah just wish it was a simple matter of popping a module on my ship.. I daresay landing there would be easier with high-pressure protection components


[22-Jan-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	ships take damage very slowly, it will be months until you will have slowdown from ship damage


[22-Jan-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aldin**:	Is gibson goin to run a few cycle of new sci immigration policy? I am thinking to move SL here since Proxion has proven to be a cash sink and people just spam SL's every week with no chance in sight even to get to 30-40%


[08-Feb-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	if there are less consumers it would be easier to crew the labs


[08-Feb-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'd assume we're running Engineer Migration first


[08-Feb-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	There will be enough SCI everywhere eventually


[08-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	in other words you don't need sci here, fair enough


[08-Feb-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We currently have open engineer jobs, no current open scientist jobs


[08-Feb-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I saw sometimes selling of HCP,GRN,MAI on Proxion LM. There should be people with a surplus. But if you produce own C, not the best option when you have to buy HCP,MAI,GRN. better you buy C

**Taiyi**:	I don't see Gibson going near SCI unless there is more Engineer jobs opening up and someone donates one or two UNI. Otherwise it would be an expensive endevour for not much gain.


[10-Feb-22 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yeah, I been looking it over for EW, and it doesn't seem worthwhile without significant POPI upgrades


[10-Feb-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	can't you just run sci campaign and get 25/week without any popi?


[10-Feb-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	You can yes, but they lose 80% of current levels without POPI to keep them


[10-Feb-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	we don't need education, we need immigration


[10-Feb-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Max out at 36ish


[10-Feb-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I would go with Griff's week long immigration bonus


[10-Feb-22 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	but honestly, we have good unemployment levels. If we could get settler happi up, the 20% happy boost for the week would be great


[10-Feb-22 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	the only problem would be sci's would maybe trigger a cogc change


[10-Feb-22 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-22 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Aldin**:	looking for 9 LDE


[22-Feb-22 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	Question for people who has bigger/more bases, does the frequency you have your ships in flight increase, or have you managed to avoid that somehow?


[22-Feb-22 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	Looking at my own rate of expansion, I either need bigger/more ships, or I need to make a flight schedule of some sort.


[22-Feb-22 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	(In the future, rn it is managable)


[22-Feb-22 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I'm prob not the best to answer this as our CORP uses designated shippers for certain routes but: Talking with people who try to do it solo - it's almost impossible to coordinate logistics after so many bases without trying to get shipping contracts. I know a few people who have cut down on the # of bases, and used permits to make each base 1000 area.


[22-Feb-22 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	They try to do flying logistics in their bases in a route fashion. Each base is hit in a sequence to refill/export and then onto the next.


[22-Feb-22 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	That is actually really useful, thank you. I hadn't considered that it is a problem that a corp could help solve.


[22-Feb-22 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Just for example: FIO has 8 bases on Gibson. We have 2 people using both ships to Ferry items back and forth from Proxion (Our main Hub in BEN Space) to resupply and export. Etherwind is our main H2o/DW Supplier for BEN/ANT, and I do almost all imports/exports there.


[22-Feb-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	It depends on how you set up your bases. I have 7, and they're all within 4 hops of Gibson, which acts as my "center hub". Most materials either go into making other products on the same planet or are shipped only one or two hops away. I've done a couple shipping contracts in the past, but I can mostly take care of it all with my ships (even with a little idle time *and* stopping by BEN & Katoa occasionally).


[22-Feb-22 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	My "hub" is the BEN station (which sucks with the limited storage), but I spend a lot of time with the base planner sheet trying to ease logistics for each base (even little things like running my own INCs vs brining C in make a difference)


[22-Feb-22 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If you need more space, you can throw up CX sell offers at some outrageous price to free your room


[22-Feb-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	That is true.  I find I'm just full with reasonable inventories of 30+ items.  It doesn't help that I do maintain a stockpile of needed items to cover CX gaps (like 100 O, COF, PWO, FLX etc)


[22-Feb-22 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I used to use the base planner. Now I just take it a little slower and go by feel.


[22-Feb-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I first do base planner, the I enter the data into my own sheet to calculte cost per units and to make my grocery list for CX trips

[02-Mar-22 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	I am based on Gibson, i did not start my company yet but am trying to get into shipping


[02-Mar-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	So you do mainly shipping contracts or buy/sell stuff from CX to CX?


[02-Mar-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	i am gunna be doing both


[02-Mar-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	but i am learning so i bet ima bleed for a long time lol


[02-Mar-22 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	If shipping is fun for you and you want to earn a good money with it, I suggest to do contracts first. Buy/Sell stuff is only fun with full shiploads and I assume you don't have the money for that


[02-Mar-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Best area for good contracts is MOR but around BEN you'll find some good ones too. for example most times there are ADs on CB-282d


[02-Mar-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	around 10.000CIS for one shipping


[02-Mar-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	hopefully you have at least basic profile to accept shipping ads, I think you must have basic/pro. Without LM ads shipping contracts should not be possible to accept


[02-Mar-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	lol damn that sounds good


[02-Mar-22 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	right now im trying to find out a direction for starting


[02-Mar-22 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	i picked up some contracts but im worried about sustain if im not producing anything


[02-Mar-22 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	you can search for shipping contract with FIO, just sort them to best payout and plan routes and calc you fuel accurately


[02-Mar-22 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	i started as a manufator but i didnt build anything yet


[02-Mar-22 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	On Gibson most people go for construction because of construction bonus from COGC


[02-Mar-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	For that you would start with Extractor for FEO, Smelter to make FE, later PP1 to construct pre-fabs


[02-Mar-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	For shipping contracts have a look at the community tools here: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/community-resources/

[02-Mar-22 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Second tool is FIO and it has https://fio.fnar.net/shipmentfinder


[02-Mar-22 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	On top you can select "all" and search for just a placeholder "*". Then you'll get all shipping contracts and can search for payout


[02-Mar-22 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	search=sort


[02-Mar-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	best paid contract for example at the moment is this one: LMA LG-418b/2568 (you can open a new buffer and paste it into that one)


[02-Mar-22 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But calculate fuel and time always before accepting a contract like this


[02-Mar-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Kinza to MOR is better for experienced shipper, but later you can do also contracts like this if you feel secure about calculation.


[02-Mar-22 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	wow man thanks so much!

[02-Mar-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**visiOOn**:	I also need 2 HB1s to start constructing correct?


[02-Mar-22 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	You need 1xHB1 per 100 PIO.


[02-Mar-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	Yeah and I think you need 60 pioneer for extractor and 50 for smelting right so 2 hb1


[02-Mar-22 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	You _can_ run that on just 100 PIO, but at a 9.1% penalty (across both).


[02-Mar-22 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	I'll leave you to decide on if that's acceptable or not (since it depends).


[02-Mar-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	Wow I didn't even think about that. I just assumed that it wouldn't work if i didn't have both


[02-Mar-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That’s where your HQ is located. Factions are dev created entities that control systems. Your only base is on Gibson, so choose CIM as your faction


[02-Mar-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	i dont see that option, it says outside region tho


[02-Mar-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Choose the one that starts with C


[02-Mar-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Since Gibson is in Castillo-Ito Mercantile space


[02-Mar-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**visiOOn**:	i can get enough to do it then refuel at ben if i need to


[06-Mar-22 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I have a ship arriving from BEN and will go back to BEN immediately to sell some bfabs. So a lot of space left. Can take nearly a shipload with me to BEN. Will calc that later in 3h when I'm back home


[06-Mar-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	@visiOOn I have around 2k FF fuel on that ship. will fill your AD then


[06-Mar-22 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**visiOOn**:	do you have any sf


[06-Mar-22 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Not an excess at the moment I'm afraid.


[06-Mar-22 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	And looks like this entire region doesn't have drinking water anymore


[06-Mar-22 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	that's... distressing


[06-Mar-22 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'm looking for an LM sell order of 300 @ the old price, or anywhere up to 75 CIS a unit. If anyone on Gibson had the foresight to build up an excess of DW


[06-Mar-22 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Had built my base less around self-sufficiency and more about pumping out the products I'm efficient at producing


[06-Mar-22 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Mar-22 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Mar-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Just to let you know. i‘ll have a lot of DW soon. Have already a base up for DW only on Poseidon but only with 200 DW output/day. Need that for myself and some on Ementior. But within 2 weeks I‘ll increase that to 800 DW/day and can also ship something here to sell it locally


[06-Mar-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	I keep a month of feedstock ready, in case of stuff like this. Slows down my expansion, but stops me from having to destitute myself incase of a market crash.


[06-Mar-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	lol well im fed and destitute lol


[06-Mar-22 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Woden**:	Liquidity is best spent making more value. If you are fed and out of cash, you are in an alright position.


[06-Mar-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	wow who just took my shipping!!!

**xensored**:	ship will arrive in 1h at BEN. Then 6h to Gibson. I can bring some for you but how much do you need?


[06-Mar-22 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	idk yet ill let you know shortly


[06-Mar-22 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	still suck at my shipping logistics


[06-Mar-22 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Ok I‘m off now for one hour. Just put an AD up on Gibson LM to buy as much SF as you need. I‘ll accept it later and bringt that SF with me


[06-Mar-22 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	actually i might just rent a storage and have you keep it at Ben


[06-Mar-22 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Yes. Just buy it on BEN yourself and rent a storage. Then create a shipping AD and I can move it to Gibson. For new players I take it for free, so just put it 1 CIS in your shipping AD


[06-Mar-22 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**visiOOn**:	thats good to know, but i might not need it shipped. i should be good to just stop there eventually


[06-Mar-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Ok I‘m off for now. Just DM me on discord and write me what you need. Will have a look later

**neke86**:	are you talking about benten CX?


[06-Mar-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I just listed 1,200 units of DW


[06-Mar-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and the last bits of RAT I had


[06-Mar-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and 300 OVE


[06-Mar-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and I've got hundreds of PWO up there


[06-Mar-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	so not sure what the shortage is


[06-Mar-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Don't know.. I just saw the price spiked from 57 to 100-120 which seemed a bit bonkers


[06-Mar-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yeah looks like supply dwindled away, I've seen heavy DW trading directly on the Etherwind LM, and a lot of it in NCC, bound for NC1 space


[06-Mar-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	This happens every few weeks/months. People don't want to pay up for supplies, so suppleirs send it elsewhere


[06-Mar-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	price rockets


[06-Mar-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	everyone has a sad


[06-Mar-22 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	anyway, I listed it at 75, well short of the next ask


[06-Mar-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Yeah when my next ship docks up I'll probably pull down another bit for a 'rainy day'


[06-Mar-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I have almost 500 tons of Peregrine Light Ag Industries freight to unload


[06-Mar-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Mar-22 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Mar-22 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Mar-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Mar-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Honestly I think the hardest thing in this game is to get the ball rolling


[07-Mar-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Most of your money ends up tied up in Infrastructure and support payments for the longest time, it isn't until later that there's some margins where you can start building up comfortable reserves.

**rpf1**:	Does anyone have any MCG? Would save me a trip to Ben Ten but I would need to buy premium


[22-Apr-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rpf1**:	Made a mistake last night that's gonna cost me :P


[22-Apr-22 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	how much MCG would you need?


[22-Apr-22 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rpf1**:	It was gonna be about 100-200 but I think I'm gonna have to do the trip anyways sadly


[22-Apr-22 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rpf1**:	Didn't realise some more of my resources weren't bought straight away, was my first time buying anything so made a few mistakes :P

***ZedStorm** left.*


[22-Apr-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	ok understand :) I'll start with 2 ships within next minutes from BEN to Gibson. If it is only lightweight stuff you need I could take it with me


[22-Apr-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rpf1**:	I would need pro for that tho right? So I can accept on local market


[22-Apr-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rpf1**:	I'm also now broke so sadly I think I will need to ship myself :(


[22-Apr-22 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	ah okay, that's right. You would at least need basic (paid one time) to accept ADs on local market. No problem, then I'll fly away now ;)


[22-Apr-22 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	Is anyone interested in my 100 MCG selling ad at 2800 CIS total?


[22-Apr-22 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	I should have mentioned it is listed in the Gibson local market.


[22-Apr-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I don't think so because price is too high. Price at BEN CX is 24/unit and that includes transport costs. On local markets prices are normally under CX and not above


[22-Apr-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	Trying to figure out pricing.  I just started less than week ago.  The Bid was 24 (23 now) with ask of 34.  Costs me 5 CIS per m3 to transport.  Where is my math wrong?


[22-Apr-22 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	Well, if you're selling on the LM, you don't have to spend the 5 CIS to ship it.  So you should be selling it cheaper, right?


[22-Apr-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Oh I see, ask on BEN is now MCG.CI1 because someone bought the stuff available for 24


[22-Apr-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	May be now someone could be interested in your 28/unit at least until the next ship arrives on BEN and MCG will be available again for reasonable prices


[22-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	My thought was it saves the customer shipping costs as well.  Even if they have cheaper fuel and more efficient ships.  Again, I am trying to understand how people think about the pricing.

[22-Apr-22 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Most people buy stuff when it is cheap or at least "normal" price. For MCG costs are around 10/unit. When you looks at a 90 day chart you'll see that MCG was sold most between 15-20/unit. So that's the normal price range


[22-Apr-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Of course people are willing to pay above 20/unit if they need it urgently and also on local market is a plus. But if you want to sell it fast and not wait for days/weeks until someone needs it urgently...you should offer it for better prices


[22-Apr-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	Ah, tx for the info.  I just found FIO yesterday, so I have not really figured normal costs for material.


[22-Apr-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But you can just try it and see if it sells for 2800, if not lower the price if you want to sell it


[22-Apr-22 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	Sounds good.  Tx again for the information.


[22-Apr-22 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I'm going to put up a new base on Proxion and need 2k MCG for that. I have it myself here but don't want to send 2 ships to Proxion, that's why I bought 1k MCG there on LM yesterday. My buy AD for 1k MCG was accepted after 1h for 15,5/unit. So I think everything below 20/unit still sells


[22-Apr-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	Cool.  I just updated my spreadsheet and see what you mean.  Cost plus is a better pricing start point.  It is line with your comments.


[22-Apr-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Balorian**:	I have been using bid/ask at BEN which is a sanity check, but not a good starting point.


[22-Apr-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	you can also look here. It it based on buying all inputs but is okay for a quick look: https://universallogistics.app/building/BMP

**xensored**:	@Magnus thx for filling the AD // @PiBoy Sorry, I entered just circa same pricing as always out of habit without looking on CX. Looks like the market also for FE is exploding like for bfabs O_o May be I should add a smelter  or 2 to have a surplus myself…

**Platonov**:	i got some FE though but i expect to sell once i can get full load in cargo


[24-Apr-22 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platonov**:	wait 10-20 days though otherwise i would waste fuel by going to orbit close to empty lol


[24-Apr-22 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platonov**:	or there no offer i can sell my few iron at 1000 and thus got the fuel to pay it back for small load

[17-May-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	You're already well established, so I doubt I can offer you anything that you can't already source yourself... But you scratched my back, so hit me up if you ever want some FEO or BSE at a discount.


[17-May-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'll keep it in mind. Welcome to the game, in any case! 🙂

**Rwinner16**:	Oh, I have more to ship.


[30-May-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Posting more on the Etherwind LM


[30-May-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**firefighter0110**:	Took two of them... have two boats that i'll send back and forth.


[30-May-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	just a reminder - you have 5d to pick up the shipment, and another 5d timer restarts for delivery


[30-May-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	so you can grab more under assumption its a 48hr round trip. Etherwind also has free WARs for you to "accept delivery" and restart the countdown


[30-May-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**firefighter0110**:	Thanks for the info... still new to the game, haha.


[30-May-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	its a way to play with the #'s to forecast your shipping lanes and get the stuf and $$ early

**3N1GM4**:	hey everyone, sorry got a newby question: if I've placed a sell order on something, and it disapeared from my ships hanger at the time (I assume it's gone into the CX somewhere) and now my ships come back to base, where does it go if I cancel the order? (to re-issue the order, but at a differente price) 😅


[03-Jun-22 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	It goes into an imaginary inventory in our CONTs


[03-Jun-22 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	you'd have to rent a warehouse at the CX, then cancel.


[03-Jun-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**3N1GM4**:	ah ok, so it'll stop us from cancelling unless we have either a "rented storage", or a "docked ship" at the CX?


[03-Jun-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I think it'll let you cancel, and just throw it in "limbo". You'd have to go to your CONT screen and find it to retrieve it when you do get storage


[03-Jun-22 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**3N1GM4**:	ah ok, thanks!😆


[03-Jun-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**firefighter0110**:	I agree with Rwinner16, I am pretty sure you have to rent warehouse space or have a ship there.  Otherwise, it is locked up in CONT and you cannot re-list it.

[16-Jun-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	@Mac-Flar: To use a Local Market or the Currency Exchange, you need to get above a U rating.  To get above a U rating, you need to have PRO or Basic (Basic = You've paid for PRO once).  The reason for this is two-fold: 1) The FX & LM allow direct transfer of goods or money, so without this limitation people could spam dummy accounts to give their main account free goods & money.  2) Devs have to eat.  You can use the CX for selling goods just fine indefinitely-- >95% of all trade is done on CXs anyhow.

[18-Jun-22 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	You should not do oxygen on Gibson, that‘s not efficient because Gibson has low amounts of oxygen. For Oxygen around BEN you can get it cheaper than CX on Nemesis or Etherwind. Better buy O than produce it here


[18-Jun-22 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I wouldn't be flying here for a few days tho


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	hey nothing that need to be forced just saw that first schip almost lost 5% and i thought it would be a good idea to spend those 2 BHP and take 2 additional in stock


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I don't think there is any performance loss until around 80%


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I think then you need 8-9 BHP for the repairs


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	okay, got information that a BHP would repair 2%


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	100/43 I think is the precise answer


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	okay, thats


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	even better


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	okay would be nice if i can bye 10 BHP. My ship will arrive at benton station in about 9:40H perhaps there is a oportunity to do the exchange there or with Warehouse. Than you dont have to bring it gibson.

**neke86**:	They're all there on the CX waiting for you :)


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I just recently reduced pricing too


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	oh great, than i will ask again, when ship arrived an i sold my stuff so i can pay you off.


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The CX is always open, you just buy when you get there and pay for it


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's not like an LM contract


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But, I do have a duty of care to tell you that you are only 18 days old and it's probably money better spent in investing in your base


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The current damage to the ship has no negative performance


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	so repairing it improves nothing immediately and robs you of several fabs worth of cash


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	okay at what lvl of damage should i think about reparing ship hull?


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	80%


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	maye 85%


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	okay than you are right and i will use my money a bit longer to expand business thanks for advice.


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	what will happen if i wait to long? will the ship fuel consumption rise or what will be the effect?


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	basically yeah and travel times degrade I think


[01-Jul-22 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Saganaki**:	It's 80%.  At 80% the ship starts to fly slower but uses the same amount of fuel.

**neke86**:	Quick sanity check before I call it a failed venture, so people actually have no interest in LST delivered here at a slight premium? I’ve had ~300 for sale at 50-70/u and no takers


[07-Jul-22 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I’ll stop bringing it if y’all prefer shipping this heavy stuff yourselves


[07-Jul-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	I (obviously) can't speak for everybody but I've been shipping in my LST directly from producing planets at 40-45/u which I think is better than the 60/u you're offering. I'd probably buy yours before I bought it on the CX at 50+


[07-Jul-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	How are you calculating that?


[07-Jul-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I mean a round trip for just 183 LST


[07-Jul-22 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	What are you costing that at


[07-Jul-22 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I pencilled it in at 2,800-3,000 in fuel alone


[07-Jul-22 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	100/80 each way for an 8hr flight


[07-Jul-22 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	100/40 sorry


[07-Jul-22 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	another 100 CIS for damage


[07-Jul-22 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	SF.CI1


[07-Jul-22 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	FF.CI1


[07-Jul-22 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	coming out to an approximate unit shipping cost of 15-18/LST


[07-Jul-22 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	with nothing paid for convenience of freeing up an entire ship to make 10k shipping something rlse

[07-Jul-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	I'm currently ignoring ship damage since I'll repair that in the future when I'm richer :)


[07-Jul-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You can ignore it but you’re still incurring the cost ^_^


[07-Jul-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And when it catches up to you: BHP.CI1 come see me haha


[07-Jul-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	The price is reasonable, but first this a starter planet I don't know how many are on trial licenses and therefore have no access to local market.


[07-Jul-22 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	I would have been interested in your ads, but i just purchased a whole ship full of LST an therefore do not need any more in the next 2-3 weeks.


[07-Jul-22 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	But after that I'm interested in buying your LST. I'm also interested in CLI in a few weeks but only small amounts ( 50 units )


[07-Jul-22 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	reach out any time, there are 2-3 of us on UV-072c throwing it off in large quantities - mostly Ryst and myself


[07-Jul-22 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	People had been picking it up off the LM as soon as it lists so I thought i’d bring it here in smaller parcels

[13-Jul-22 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jul-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jul-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Galger**:	can i buy things on planet or do i have to buy them at the exchanges


[20-Jul-22 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	i was going to an exchange to buy missing inventory for one of my order ques


[20-Jul-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	seems to be nothing for sale on local market


[20-Jul-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	LM is very finnicky, will be odd items, things people are making here, or pre-arranged trades


[20-Jul-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You can put up a buy ad, but only if you have LM access


[20-Jul-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	someone might fill it, but its unlikely


[20-Jul-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	This is a construction planet, so I doubt anyone is farming here or making coffee for instance


[20-Jul-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	also seems i need a pro license to access the local market


[20-Jul-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jul-22 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	burn little fuel


[20-Jul-22 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	im not sure what i can do starting out i have a 7 hour order being made, i have a base and two ships, i have two habitation modules and a basic materials plant and a prefab plant


[20-Jul-22 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	my order que is making a basic bulk head


[20-Jul-22 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	also why am i paying super corp a fee for production if they are my plants ?


[20-Jul-22 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Okay a lot to unpack there hang on


[20-Jul-22 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Super Corp is the governor, so that's a planetary tax


[20-Jul-22 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	interesting a tax on production rather than sale


[20-Jul-22 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	your [GOV] prefix, what does that mean


[20-Jul-22 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yes the tax is on production, although there are also fees to rent storage (when a warehouse exists) and use the local market


[20-Jul-22 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	GOV is the prefix I chose for my one-person corporation, as I am the Governor of Katoa, a nearby manufacturing planet


[20-Jul-22 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You've started on Gibson, which has a Construction bonus.


[20-Jul-22 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I don't know exactly what the optimal start is for a constructor, but I'd probably extract and smelt iron ore, and build basic prefabs in a PP1


[20-Jul-22 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	how come you can hear my communications, do you have assets on gibson is that why?


[20-Jul-22 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Then all you need to do is buy pioneer consumables and limestone


[20-Jul-22 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yes, this is the Gibson planet chat, I have a base here


[20-Jul-22 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	thanks for all the help by the way, appreciated. What do i need to do to extract iorn ore


[20-Jul-22 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	im guessing looking at it i need to build an extractor building


[20-Jul-22 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	which im missing components


[20-Jul-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	perhaps i should go get the missing components from an exchange and build an extractor


[20-Jul-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Seeing as you started jut 2 hours ago


[20-Jul-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	COLIQ and start again


[20-Jul-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	zero progress lost


[20-Jul-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	COLIQ ?


[20-Jul-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	liquidate company command


[20-Jul-22 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	put it in a new buffer if you want to start fresh


[20-Jul-22 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'm not sure what the starting package supports, but you'll want an EXT and a SME and a PP1 with supporting HB1


[20-Jul-22 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	should i have not chosen constructor start?


[20-Jul-22 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Correct start and planet, but you've built a BMP


[20-Jul-22 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	actually, you should be able to demolish and get all the resources back


[20-Jul-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	1 EXT, 1 SME, 1 PP1, 2 HB1


[20-Jul-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	okay ill destroy it and get back BSE(5) BBH(4) BDE(2) and MCG(48)


[20-Jul-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	BBH15, BDE 11, BSE 30, BTA 2, MCG 324 would make those buildings


[20-Jul-22 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Then send a ship to the CX to buy C, O, and LST


[20-Jul-22 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and DW, RAT, OVE, PWO


[20-Jul-22 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	when it gets BACK, then you build the buildings


[20-Jul-22 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	or you can build the EXT right away and start extracting and piling up FEO


[20-Jul-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	This planet also has an O supply you can extract with a collector


[20-Jul-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and water for eventually farming and making your own carbon


[20-Jul-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	so you'll have to spend some time researching what to do :)


[20-Jul-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	Yeah even with the destroy i would be seriously short on BBH BDE BSE BTA MCG


[20-Jul-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But thats literally the game :D


[20-Jul-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Okay


[20-Jul-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I recommend COLIQ, clean slate


[20-Jul-22 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	send one ship slowly to the CX


[20-Jul-22 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and in the interim, start researching what you want to do here :)


[20-Jul-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	okay thanks for the advice, if i coliq what start other than constructor should i pick?


[20-Jul-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	i built the recomended constructor buildings


[20-Jul-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	it told me to build the BMP


[20-Jul-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Man the opening manual really is terrible


[20-Jul-22 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Maybe some actual constructors can chime in here


[20-Jul-22 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I don't know what resources you start with


[20-Jul-22 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But a HB1, EXT and COL would get you extracting raw materials you can sell at least


[20-Jul-22 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	thanks im going to coliq

[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Right, so it must want to focus on just literally the construction


[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	useless


[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'd build nothing then, fly to the CX, get what you need


[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	i cant build a collector either, i can build a rig though


[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	come home and build


[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	dont build a rig haha


[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Out of curiosity, what does it start you with


[20-Jul-22 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	2 fully fueled ships?


[20-Jul-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	2 fully fueled ships, BBH-15 BDE-9 OVE-5 RAT-40 BSE-14 BTA-2 DW-40 FTL-100 FE-5 LST-26 MCG-204 PE-1000 SIO-6 STL-450


[20-Jul-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Okay


[20-Jul-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I understand now


[20-Jul-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The materials you have there allow you to build a BMP, and then make MCG. And a PP1, and make some BSE


[20-Jul-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	and some BDE


[20-Jul-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	i had constructor, farmer, manufacturer, and a couple of other options to start, this is the manufacturer start - there wasnt a mining start :/


[20-Jul-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Oh this is manufacturer, not constructor?


[20-Jul-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	yeah my restart was manufacturer, as constructor was kind of a dead end


[20-Jul-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	In that case just build a BMP and a HB1 and start figuring out how to build all those ingredients into things


[20-Jul-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	okay ill give it a go, and then sell at the comodity exchange


[20-Jul-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	yeap


[20-Jul-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	can strip the fuel off one ship too and sell that if you want


[20-Jul-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	short term cash boost


[20-Jul-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	starts me with 200 pioneers, but one pioneer Hab only accomodates 100, will the otherd die, or just be unhappy lol


[20-Jul-22 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Galger**:	hopefully 150 units of MCG sells for more than my cost of space ship fuel round trip to the exchange

**pounder**:	FRMs on Gibson are reasonable but not great but if you get a pro or basic license you can probably sell your carbon here to people running SME (Smelters) on world (and maybe one day become such a person)


[28-Jul-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Satsukitane**:	alright thanks this game is pretty complex I'll propably start now learn the basics and then dissolve and start from fresh I think

[29-Jul-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Previous gov was woden and he hasn't answered until today how he wants to reimburse at least some of the contributed materials. So I assume he just went away with the money. Same this time, Setler never responded, I asked him if he would try to fill the COCG upfront, but never reponded same like woden.


[29-Jul-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Is it a form of piracy to be Gov and just don't repsond and take away the taxes? If yes, we should all blacklist them. And of course vote for a responsible Gov next time. Unfortunately also molp can't reset the time for the election. I asked him about that.


[29-Jul-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Regarding upkeep: Thanks to all donations until now! I fulfilled rest of the RAT but unfortunately sent most of my DW away yesterday. I have 5k DW arriving in 21h from Poseidon. Then I can fill the DW. Or if anyone cann fill it now, I can offer to reimburse you in 21h and give the DW back

**xensored**:	Filled PE and MCG for next time. Will fill DW tomorrow and I'm sure we can also take care for RATs next days. So we're fine for next due date in 10 days. After that, we will have a new Gov...

**neke86**:	If you’re looking to upgrade ships in the coming future and wish to purchase SSC, drop me a line. I’ll be selling them for 250. I had listed 700 in advance of the update but they were just bought and re-listed by a scalper. Don’t pay 450/u, I can easily service what you need for upgrades.

[16-Aug-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheOtherSamB**:	is there anything that we're lacking though?


[16-Aug-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	Welcome


[16-Aug-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	Unless you have a pro license you can only trade at a CX (commodities exchange) so the question is what does the region/universe need (which is most things I think). If you have PRO license you can trade on planet at the LM (local market) and you'll see that FE sells well


[16-Aug-22 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheOtherSamB**:	I have the pro license


[16-Aug-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheOtherSamB**:	Is there any reason for me to vertically integrate carbon/oxygen production to run my smelter?

[16-Aug-22 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	So it depends on whether it's cheaper to produce the C and O or to buy it. I'm guessing at current O prices and given the concentration on Gibson  you're better off buying the O at the CX. C has gone up since I stopped buying it so I'm not sure if you're better off producing it here or not.

**Felmer**:	hey guys, I had some time to get a first impression of governing Gibson. Looks like the taxes are far to low. Tax income is roughly 65k / week. GOGC upkeep exceeds this on its own nearly. I´m going to raise the taxes especially for the higher population. If any seasoned player has some suggestions i would appreciate a message :)

**xensored**:	No problem, taxes on Ementior are nearly the same. To keep the ENG for PP4 we also need a Art Gallery, but that's also expensive. Upkeep should be paid from taxes. If you have a surplus then, we can use it to upgrade the infrastructure. That will allow cheaper upkeep.


[27-Aug-22 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	And after some weeks we can maybe also reduce the taxes. But first ther're a lot of costs. Maybe advanced players can also donate something to allow invests on infrastructure upgrades to get everything going better


[27-Aug-22 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tarinaky**:	ENG/PP4 is... miles away from where I am in the game right now. :s Just like taxes in real life I guess.

**RIFTWLK**:	should my first batch of iron ore take 17hrs?


[20-Sep-22 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	The production time depends on your production efficiency, but 17 hours sounds ok. Mine need about 12 h with 106% efficiency.


[20-Sep-22 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Somebody7070**:	Mine take around 17 when I feed my workers


[20-Sep-22 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**GeneralEmu23**:	not gonna lie this game terrifies me cause it seems so complex


[20-Sep-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	its okay to be terrified


[20-Sep-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	because it is complex


[20-Sep-22 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralEmu23**:	im just afraid I am messing up. in order to sell my ore do I first transport it to the commodity exchange then sell it or is there another way to sell it


[20-Sep-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	If you are free player, you have to ship it to a CX (Commodity Exchange)


[20-Sep-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	PRO/Basic can put it up on "Local Markets" (LM) on individual planets


[20-Sep-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	but doesn't mean it will be sold fast there, if there is no demand locally ofcourse


[20-Sep-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralEmu23**:	ok thank you that helps is it the same thing for buying goods as well


[20-Sep-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	Yes, its the same for buying =)


[20-Sep-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaler**:	Exactly, find the demand and provide supply. Profits....


[20-Sep-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralEmu23**:	Thank you all so much


[20-Sep-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	And since shipping to/from a CX usually takes hours each way, planning some days ahead is valuable =)


[20-Sep-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralEmu23**:	is the sub worth it


[20-Sep-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralEmu23**:	i couldnt find on the website what it gets you maybe I am just dumb


[20-Sep-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaler**:	A complex game is usually one that is the most satisfying once understood.


[20-Sep-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	The subscription is, as far as i'm aware, not super crucial early on


[20-Sep-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	the Local Markets can be convenient, but it doesn't guarantee easy or cheap wares


[20-Sep-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	I went PRO after a couple days, but solely so i could check the "Unload on arrival" for my ship, as i was going to bed, and it would arrive at my base with materials for my production lines overnight


[20-Sep-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	and i needed those to keep making stuff :P


[20-Sep-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	But that could of been avoided if i had planned it just a tad bit better xD


[20-Sep-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	I do also believe that another limitation of not having PRO, is you cannot _build_ additional ships, but the two starting ships should be enough for a fair while, till you get a feeling for the game and decide if you wanna spend a bit on it =)

**cidgrad22**:	Accepted all


[21-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ilirith**:	done, thanks =)


[21-Sep-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralEmu23**:	How does that work sending resources on others ships? Like do I have to trade the materials to you or is that what a shipping contract for?


[21-Sep-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GeneralEmu23**:	and if so is it something only pro licenses can do?


[21-Sep-22 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cidgrad22**:	It's something you need a pro license to do. Basically you put up the shipping contract for x material. I accept the contract. Your material gets packaged into a bundle called a shipment. I can not see what you are shipping only the weight/m3 of the entire shipment. I load the shipment onto my ship, fly to the destination, and deliver it to your inventory where it unpackages

**wickedmuso**:	As I posted a little earlier (and got a response - thanks)... I am really new to the game. I have made some FEO and FF/SF and have sold it but I seem to be losing money. I bought some consumables to keep the workers happy. I am probably doing something wrong and maybe should reset?

**FInglan**:	This combination seems a bit strange for Gibson. Which starter package dis you have? Fuel Refining? It's seems you have a Extractor and a Fuel Refinery which makes more sense on Katoa as the ressources are far better suited. I think you've got 2 options change the planet aka restart or tear down the refinery build a smelter and make money from the iron you produce. Ores are heavy and bring little income and for Fuel you need to bury the ingridients from the CX which leaves with very small margins.


[09-Feb-23 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	On Gibson you should try to get a PP1 as soon as possible to make some profit. Own FE is okay but the PP1 and bfabs should be prio because you‘ll get most profit from them at the beginning


[09-Feb-23 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Even if you buy FE and LST, you‘ll make more money with PP1

[09-Feb-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Feb-23 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I might be wrong, but I think the payback period for a COL collecting O (without experts) is 97.8 days.


[17-Feb-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Yeah, that's slow.  is RIG better or worse than that?


[17-Feb-23 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Maybe someone else can confirm, but I don't think RIGs pay for themselves on Gibson. Technically RIG might turn a "profit", but nothing of that profit would remain after the costs of consumables.


[17-Feb-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	For profit alone, it might be best to stick with the CoGC i.e. prefabs.

[18-Feb-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I don't like depending on The Market for Basic Consumables (don't wanna starve my workers if there's a Galactic shortage), but no choice, I guess.


[18-Feb-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Looks like RAT and DW prices are reasonably stable these days, at least.


[18-Feb-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	When you take the ppl approach you can easily build frm and FP to be self reliant. I started this way it is not recommended because most players like specialisation.

[20-Feb-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	(or did PU hook up to some new Game Service?  It was like this - an avalanche of new players - when PU got on Steam)


[20-Feb-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	As far as I'm aware, PU did get covered by a streamer or two (relatively) recently. Don't remember their names, but hey.

**Germanspeaker**:	what was your first steps?


[18-Mar-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	First you want to get your production buildings going. After that it might be a good idea to send a ship to the nearest CX. You can sell your products there and buy new input materials.


[18-Mar-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Germanspeaker**:	I think i mess up. How can I start new on steam?


[18-Mar-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you want to restart, you can open a new buffer by clicking on "NEW BFR" in the lower left corner, and then typing "COLIQ" into that buffer.

[19-Mar-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kesa**:	I would say either no raw materials, no consumables or no order for the buildings. Considering you just started it might be that the starting raw materials are still loaded in the other ship, which you have to unload into your base storage as well


[19-Mar-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**leaver12**:	the game hasn't started me off with any BTA is that intentional?


[19-Mar-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kesa**:	Depending on what profession you are starting with, it provides you with material for the recommended buildings. For example for a constructor, have a loook at this:

**FInglan**:	Hi, anyone here who has a NE production I need about 100 NE. I can fetch the material from source location if needed, but would prefer to get more than just 100 in that case.

**ComingOfCoyote**:	Is there a way to redirect a ship midflight to a new destination or must you abort, let it fly home then send it out again?


[05-Apr-23 02:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	you can abort. It will stop at the next waypoint and from there you can plot a new course. Keep an eye on your fuel.

**Konvolut**:	I played in previous Universe, when there were only 3 Factions (no Antares).  IIRC, players were allowed to start anywhere, but you were likely to fail if you didn't start on or near one of the CX planets (Promitor, Monten, Katoa).


[05-Apr-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Many Planets named by Players in the prev Universe were carried over to this one., but often in different places and with different climates & resources.


[05-Apr-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Also, IIRC, when this Universe started, you could start anywhere.  I took 6-8 months off, and I was surprised (and kinda annoyed) that new rules limited my options for Start Base.


[06-Apr-23 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	I think for new player with no idea about game mechanics it is helpfull to start like it is. when I started out, I almost gave up on the selection for profession and faction. Now with experience it wouldn't be a problem anymore, maybe there should be an option button that allows you to choose freely. Something for experienced people who are starting over.

[17-Apr-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I reduced my FE production on Giedi a lot because of the AML/SI receipe change. I need a lot more SI for my electronics, that's why I don't have a FE surplus anymore :(

[23-Apr-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you'd like to mine Iron Ore, you'll need an EXT (extractor). In the construction screen, there'll be a tab for Resources. Extractor will be right there.

**barrianic**:	i used all the BSE i had available


[23-Apr-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Glad to hear it. If anything else comes to mind, feel free to ask either here in Gibson planet chat or in Global chat. There's almost always someone around who's willing to help.


[23-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**barrianic**:	does the inventory ship automaticaly refill?


[23-Apr-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Nope. Any items, regardless of which inventory they're in, will have to either be produced or bought (usually from the commodity exchange, or CX).


[23-Apr-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Thankfully Gibson specialises in construction, so if you need more BSE, it's pretty easy to make some more with a PP1 building.


[23-Apr-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**barrianic**:	my order for water imidiately halted, is it because my pioneers have no where to live?


[23-Apr-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	You need both a place for workers to live and a place to work. If after that they still don't work, it's usually because they need consumables (should be in your inventory).

**xensored**:	"haltet" means that you don't have any worker. That's because of no habitation buildings available or because no workers available on a planet. Gibson has spare workers available, so you should have a look to construct building --> infrastructure --> Habitation building for the workers you need (probably HB1 or HB2 for pioneers or settlers

[20-May-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Konvolut**:	But also EXT (for either?) to dig FEO here?


[20-May-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Aye. Regardless of whether SME or BMP is picked, the buildings will have to be fed something. Whether that be FEO for the SME or something like C+H for BMP.


[20-May-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	IMO, Metalurgy is a much better choice for starting here on Gibson, because your primary Input - FEO - is plentiful and cheap to dig.


[20-May-23 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Later you can build a COL to get O, also needed for Smelting.  (One COL easily feeds two SME's, with a little leftover to sell).

**kesa**:	Do I see this correctly, that there are no more TEC to recruit currently? At least I only got 16 after I built an HB3


[07-Jun-23 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kesa**:	Which is also odd, since there is a 5% unemployment in the pop. report from 10h ago


[07-Jun-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	There is a total pool unemployed and a weekly limit on how many can be instant claimed - if your 16 are within () you've likely hit the limit


[07-Jun-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Next pop-report will again check the values and prioritize filling open jobs before calculating the pool again


[07-Jun-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kesa**:	Ah okay. Yes, currently 16 (16)


[07-Jun-23 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jun-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Jun-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	I find that the best way to get something “asap” is to post a buy ad on the LM and then comment in the chat that you have posted such an ad.  But to each their own I guess

**rotceH**:	Greetings everyone, just a quick one, what's the main difference between the Local Market and the Commodity Exchange? I can see that they are somehow different, but at the first sight Commodity Exchange seems to be the place I have to go when I need to buy or sell stuff, so  when Local Market is the actual better choice comparing to the Commodity Exchange?

[18-Jun-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Hey there. The name gives it away a little: the Local Market is mostly for people with bases (or regular business) on Gibson. Given that Gibson is a construction planet, prefabs and some inputs can sometimes be had here at lower prices than the CX (since there's no shipping involved). Anything beyond those goods though, and you'll probably want to check the CX.

[30-Jun-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Admiral_qiu**:	sweeten the deal: 150 CIS per unit for a total of 22.5K. PM for inquiry


[01-Jul-23 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**the_gil**:	Quick question, I made some trades, how can I see them playing out?


[01-Jul-23 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Depends a bit on whether you actually bought/sold something or only put orders in the market. If it's the former, the goods should now be in your warehouse (or held in CONTS). As for buy/sell orders on the CX that haven't been filled yet, you can look up the material in question and check the order book.


[01-Jul-23 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	The "ASK" price means you instantly get the goods since that's what people are saying they want for their goods - If you put up "Bid" you'll have to wait until someone is willing to bring goods over and hand them over at that price, which can take a while depending on what it is and how much you offered.


[01-Jul-23 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And as mentioned above, for ASK you'll need a warehouse - where the goods end up.


[01-Jul-23 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If you have BIDs however, they can go past your inventory capacity and remain stored in a contract under CONTS until you have a ship or warehouse with space avaliable and click to grab some / all of it

[17-Jul-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	It depends a bit on what you want to produce. If your intention is to pull iron ore out of the ground, using an extractor (under the resources tab) is indeed the way to go. You can sell that as is, but for turning that iron ore into iron, you'd have to use a smelter (found under the pioneers tab).

**Konvolut**:	(2) Buy them at the Commodity Exchange (CX) in the Benten System (gotta fly there in one of your Ships to drop off Mats to Sell & pick up what you Buy)


[29-Jul-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	(3) Buy them from the Local Market (LM) here on Gibson (click the word "Gibson" in blue, somewhere on your screen, look for "Local Market, click that).

**Arystus**:	Hi i am New. I started as mining guy. Do you guy need Iron (FE) or is it better to fly it to BEN.


[30-Jul-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Admiral_qiu**:	it depends on the price people give you! It costs fuel to send stuff to benten and you need to sell at market price


[30-Jul-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KurisuMurei**:	So if you do send it to a CX, bring more at once. Otherwise, hang on to it and see if a contract that asks for it pops up.


[30-Jul-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KurisuMurei**:	Of course, you'll likely need to get some supplies from a CX as well, so bring some of the stuff you want to sell there on the same trip.


[30-Jul-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	@Arystus I added a couple of small FE buy orders on the local market. They are slightly below CX prices (500/u), but you can get your stuff sold quick and don't have to transport anything. It's totally up to you whether you want to take the offer of course. Perhaps someone else can chime in on whether it's a good deal or not.

**Kindling**:	I would say yes, definitely. But it depends on factors like "how big is your consumption of FE", "what are the CX prices at", and "how convenient/bothersome/expensive is is to run my on smelting stuff"


[12-Aug-23 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	For me as an example it made total sense to set up FE production on the nearby JS-601c. I have Gibson filled with PP1s, FE prices are quite high, and there is a really good source of FEO right next door.


[12-Aug-23 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	So it can definitely make sense, but you need to think though what you want to achieve, and whether setting up your own FE production will get you there or not.

**ThedriD**:	okay thanks


[12-Aug-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	IMO, if Gibson is your only/first Base, it makes sense to Dig FEO & cook FE.


[12-Aug-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	When you can afford it, build a COL to get your own O (and some to sell).


[12-Aug-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Players with many Bases can be picky (Efficient) about where they get Resources, but with only one Base, take what you can get.


[12-Aug-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	yes, everything Konvolut said. I came at the problem from the "I now have 500k+ to spend on a new base", which I realize now was not really relevant to your situation.

**I_am_Tex**:	Just a quick sanity check for the newer folks here .... there are a lot of pros for making your own core supplies, and there is certainly nothing wrong with making O on Gibson.  But .... O is dirt cheap on BEN exchange right now.  Consider the opportunity cost of making your own O vs buying O and building another SME or PP1 with that building investment.

[15-Aug-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Yup, it’s a cycle and it will flip again at some point.  Like I said, there isn’t a right or wrong answer.  It’s all about opportunity cost, and right now, I don’t think I could justify building a COL vs buying O on the exchange.

**Arystus**:	Selling Supplys in Localmarket, Basic Rations & Overals, Drinking water and Some Limestone


[21-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@Arystus, you may want to check current exchange (CX) prices first. In a new buffer window: CXOB RAT.CI1


[21-Aug-23 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Current ASK is 150/u, and the market maker sells at 166. So the probability of selling on the LM at 182.4/u is highly unlikely unless someone is in dire need (and perhaps not even then).


[21-Aug-23 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	@Ryst thanks for the hint. But you forget the fuel you can calculate it. I have only a 5% profit margin and i flyed with min settings on my ship. so yea the price in benten is lower but with fuel costs you pay only a 5% premium on my prices.


[21-Aug-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Thing is that many people need to go to CX to sell their goods, so it makes sense they pick up food on the way back anyway. But yes, sometimes people need to top up in case they run out.


[21-Aug-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Still, I wish you luck with the project, glad to see contracts :)


[21-Aug-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	well i didn't think of that.... well if i dind't sell that i have provisions for months


[21-Aug-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	thanks


[21-Aug-23 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	I've also traded on some planets before I settled on something to make. I sold food and water at heaps of 100/each and overalls at 50/each. The cost of setting up an order eats into profit margins, especially for overalls.


[21-Aug-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	OVE.CI1


[21-Aug-23 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	yes i thougt about that and had ew players in mind who maybe not want to buy 100 at once like i would'nt do that but establishd may buy in bulk


[21-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	and the 65 cis tax is of course calculatet so i have 5% profit


[21-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	made an excel sheet ^^


[21-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Nice, I made one yesterday for flight costs. Though I am unsure if my repair calculations are correct.


[21-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	I read it used 75% of plates to repair but I dont know if that is already in the blueprints or not, and if the same thing applies to SSCs


[21-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	uuuuuu repair costs that i have to calculate to ok maybe less than 5%... damit


[21-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	You fly between here and BEN at min fuel? I can calc what I got for you.


[21-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	yes with min fuel and reaktor


[21-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Or you fly to some planet to get it sourced through buy orders in their LMs?


[21-Aug-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Arystus**:	@spacebus thanks


[21-Aug-23 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Repair costs are very low though, even if I overestimate it. 87 CIS / flight so it's a small portion of it.


[21-Aug-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	yea but worth calculation


[21-Aug-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Yeah, some places like Benten to Katoa cost 500+ in repairs alone.

[24-Aug-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	LST.CI1


[24-Aug-23 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	yes now pls calculate the flight cost in it with 75 buying and 5% profit you are at 105 per unit


[24-Aug-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Yes for 100 LST your offer is better than buying at ask (75) going back and forth. But have to go to Ben to sell anyway. It's more if I don't have enough space to pack things into the ship to get back.


[24-Aug-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	So if I still have to go back and forth, 75 beats 94.


[24-Aug-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IsenWrath**:	nobody is flying ships around with LST only, that is why the fuel calc you have is off


[24-Aug-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	well under that cirmunstances yes, i need my 2nd base on asbestos then i can make the price ceaper i think thats the way to go


[24-Aug-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	I need to see how much m3 LST I need, I am still somewhat clueless. All I know is that I have more than enough LST at the moment.


[24-Aug-23 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Half a ship gets me about 1 weeks worth of production.


[24-Aug-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	thats a lot. Yea i try to search a way to supply gibson and make a litte bit money out of it e.g. that somebody dont need an extra ship to suppy them but of course i did't think about the export it would be better if i can make both ways happend. Well i need to change the calculation if i can buy up some products here and ship them that would make everything easyer


[24-Aug-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	If I need an extra injection of LST without going there and back I can also just set up a courier contract. I had people courier me stuff before.


[24-Aug-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	But yes it is convenient to have it at hand, but it would also be convenient if someone bought my products.


[24-Aug-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arystus**:	what kind of products you produce it would be great that i know what i shall calculation to buy up ^^


[24-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	Check your PM shortly.

[31-Aug-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	LST is still sitting around 120. It was up to 150 last week on the CI1 exchange.


[31-Aug-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Not much production at the moment of LST in the JS-952 system. The planets that have it are either hot as hell or colder than a welldigger's knee.


[31-Aug-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Both conditions make for expensive base building.


[31-Aug-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	There's Ementior, with all green environmental conditions... Though I'll be the first to admit that it's further away, and that if you're settling Ementior, you're doing it for the ALO - not the LST.


[31-Aug-23 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spacebus**:	I got LST at CI1 for 60 not too long ago so I consider it quite high at 120. Maybe I was just lucky and at the right time and place.

[02-Sep-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	Well heres a question, I just started less than 5 minutes ago, I've got the four recommended starter buildings for metallurgist, and I started an order for Iron Ore, but it simply says 'halted'


[02-Sep-23 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	Nevermind, just unloaded the rations and tools and stuff for my people and they started


[02-Sep-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Yeah, for some silly reason they want to be fed and have tools for handling the iron o


[02-Sep-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	So is the beginning super slow? My first order says it'll take almost 17 hours, is there anything else to do in the meantime?


[02-Sep-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	I'm a manufacturer, so I have no idea of what a metallurgist's starter buildings are.


[02-Sep-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	Extractor, Smelter, and 2 Habitats, pretty simple stuff


[02-Sep-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	But, for the most part, the start is slow.


[02-Sep-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	Gotcha


[02-Sep-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	So, you've got them busy extracting FEO, right?


[02-Sep-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	I've got one order extracting 7 units of FEO, one order processing the stuff I have into 18 units of FE


[02-Sep-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Early on, your biggest expenses are going to be C and O, in addition to your daily expenditures


[02-Sep-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	The planet I'm on has a good bit of O, so I can pull that from the atmosphere I think once I get the building supplies to make it, so it'll just be C (probably)


[02-Sep-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	O.CI1


[02-Sep-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	C.CI1


[02-Sep-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	I'd recommend building a farm and an incinerator before a collector


[02-Sep-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	you have 2 ships. click on scrns, travel


[02-Sep-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Doesn't make sense to travel empty, so wait on your iron and haul it to Benten station to sell for revenue to cover more stuff you'll need


[02-Sep-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	then fly back to Gibson. Lather, rinse, repeat


[02-Sep-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	Makes sense, in that case I guess I'll be back in a couple of hours/days


[02-Sep-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	start is slow. gets hectic later on


[02-Sep-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Devilish_Struggles**:	I can imagine


[02-Sep-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	If you can afford the time, push the fuel and reactor usage down, because these ships are hungry at higher rates.

[03-Sep-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Or you have stuff you've bought through the CX that you need to pick up.

[04-Sep-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Most people in here are more than happy to answer questions.


[04-Sep-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@MarkBlaireau hard disagree. Order size of 1


[04-Sep-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	There is no benefit to larger order sizes unless you have a lot of production buildings and no recurring orders


[04-Sep-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You are just going to be sitting around and waiting for that large order to finish when you could sold the FE in the mean time


[04-Sep-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Queue many orders of size 1


[04-Sep-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	A little hard to sell not being at a CX starting out. Being on Gibson, selling a unit at a time wouldn't cover fuel costs to get it to the CX at Benten. one unit at a time


[04-Sep-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	and that's at minimum fuel consumption and taking 2 days, 9h for the flight.


[04-Sep-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That's true. But large orders provide no benefit.


[04-Sep-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you check in more than once every 3-4 days starting out, you can get away with 1x orders


[04-Sep-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And that gives you much more flexibility


[04-Sep-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Order size of 1 and fly when you're ready. Versus order size of 5 and have to time your flights with your orders.


[04-Sep-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	With no downside to smaller orders


[04-Sep-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Matt_Rethyu**:	With 1 sized orders, you can use the products yourself as they are produced. With higher sizes you need to wait ages for all of them to finish before you can use any.


[04-Sep-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Matt_Rethyu**:	Though if you know you won't need to use them or want to sell them other than all at once, the batch is useful. Both have their purpose.


[04-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Makes no sense to fly with only one, and can't sell unless at the CX.


[04-Sep-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Matt_Rethyu**:	Yeah, but you don't have to send a ship after each one. If I need some H20 for my farms NOW, I'm not gonna do a batch of it that will take days to produce.


[04-Sep-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Matt_Rethyu**:	I want 1 unit ASAP.


[04-Sep-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	in the case of water, that makes sense. in the case of iron, on an account less than a day old, not so much.

**Kindling**:	I made a miscalculation, and I'm 1 LSE short here on Gibson. If anyone has 1 of those laying around, I'd appreciate if you could fill my LM order. Well above CX ask prices. Thank you

**MarkBlaireau**:	If a construction project has that urgent a need, something went terribly wrong in either the planning or permitting stages of things.


[09-Sep-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kindling**:	It's not urgent in the sense that everything will fall apart, it's just frustrating when the math didn't add up, and I have to wait 24-48h to be able to get something shipped again. I'm able to pay my way out of it, so I choose to 😊 But yes, the most economical/efficient thing to do would be to wait. I am heavily optimizing for "fun" when playing though, and sometimes that is worth a bit of money to me.


[09-Sep-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Sep-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	If I don't want to wait, I've found that a good way to get it filled fast is setting a much higher price. It doesn't matter much for me with small quantities. It's also a way to say thanks for helping out.

[10-Sep-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	those have to be shipped in. Anyone doing that would likely need to charge a premium for the shipping costs on the LM

**KingsleyO**:	im carbon farmer, got two houses, two farms and an incinerator ... now what


[23-Sep-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Several options available to you. You could just set up production orders and wait for them to finish. Alternatively, you might want to send a ship to the nearest commodity exchange (CX) in Benten. Consumables for your workforce can be bought there, and that's also where you'll go when you have something to sell.

**Aescula**:	@Person810 Hanging onto mine for later construction (and I only have 12), but you can always send a ship off to Benten Station and trade everything there. That said, I'm not opposed to a trade -- whatcha produce?


[25-Sep-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Person810**:	i produce iron and steel, but its ok ive already sent a ship back to benten


[25-Sep-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-23 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KurisuMurei**:	Also, consider getting some Flux. You'll almost certainly get more money from the extra refined Iron (or Aluminum) you get from adding Flux.


[27-Sep-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ChickenClucker**:	Steel seems to not be worth it at the moment. It's about the same profit as iron after your material costs but with extra time put into it, at least at the current prices.


[27-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ChickenClucker**:	Seems like the contracts you get every day or so are a good way to boost your income from Iron as well. I get contracts buying iron ore at 150 each, buying iron at 700 each. Plus they usually give a bonus of fuel, basic consumables, or building materials worth at least another 50-150 per ore, 150-400 per iron.

**CheeryMan**:	Decided to sell my first product - Iron metal. Hell, it's cheaper than Carbon - one of its components. How can you sell your Iron metals with profit?


[02-Oct-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If one unit of carbon made only one unit of iron you'd be right, but one carbon makes four iron (assuming you're using flux).


[02-Oct-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	Yes, I got wrong)


[02-Oct-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	No worries, I used to think the same thing. :p


[02-Oct-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	regular market prices in generally cover production costs with a nice margin. not always. but normally.


[02-Oct-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	iron. aluminum make a nice margin


[02-Oct-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	@CheeryMan you can also easily convert metals to prefabs too...


[02-Oct-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	or other construction products... this planet is specialized in construction works


[02-Oct-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChickenClucker**:	Yeah the PWO is much cheaper and mine only take .4 per day, so that seems like it could be worth it.


[04-Oct-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	the standard ship will need 8 BHP and 8 SSC when you reach 80%


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	right :)


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	exactly why i don't ever want to run empty


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	gotta make every flight count


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	and later in the game you will be very glad for people who are able to ship on your behalf


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	considering ships can run you for 400k very easily


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	ofc


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	that or if shipping turns out to be lucrative enough i could end up fully leaning into just

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	still waiting on my contracts


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'm 75K away from buying the second kit


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	should be soon. He got 7 requests in 2 days and wasnt prepaired for that huge an influx


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	dang nice


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	I am a long way off kit 2 lol


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	i actually got good recommendations on what i should do by just chatting with some people for a while,


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	he told me he was waiting for receiving a next kit :P  I'll ping him back when i'm ready to get my second ship... I've placed the money in the bank in the meantime so I don't misdirect fund :P


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	such as how copper is pretty big via Benten


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	good idea. many corps do have some level of restriction, but worth it. Ev1l  asks people to have played for about a month first so you know it is something worth doing and you will not just quit 2 days later


[04-Oct-23 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ComingOfCoyote**:	Looking for opinions.  Is it worth it to extend into PP3 and PP4  construction products?  The daily sales volumes seems a lot lower than PP1 and PP2 products.


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ComingOfCoyote**:	Sure, margins are higher, but liquidity is lower.


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	i usually use PRUNplanner in order to identify if expanding or building some things in the first place will be worth it for me


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	then again my "is it worth it" measurement is directly proportional to prospective profits.


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	^ this being just for raw value of the goods produced compared to my preferred CX


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	but yeah, viewing the overall demand (at least visible via orders) of PP3-4 goods..


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	just looking at it scares me


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	compared to the initial bfabs everyone needs period


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	:(


[05-Oct-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	i'm on board with you when it comes to not going up past like PP2 for now


[05-Oct-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ComingOfCoyote**:	That's an excellent point.  Thanks for the tip!


[05-Oct-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	also HSEs


[05-Oct-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ComingOfCoyote**:	HSEs take *forever* to make.   Dang.


[05-Oct-23 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	time or money. HSEs can be bought on the CX right now for the low, low bargain price of 11,000 CIS. lol


[05-Oct-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	"low low bargain price"


[05-Oct-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	lol


[05-Oct-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i just prepared to build some new buildings on giedi prime and repair two... it cost me 7 HSEs... it hurts


[05-Oct-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	fyi i'll have two ships probably headed back from benten to gibson in the coming days


[05-Oct-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'll see how my consumption evolves - my ship dedicated to visiting Gibson is currently being upgraded.  Which means more storage and less back-and-forth for resupply


[05-Oct-23 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	I pulled a handful of idi0t's shipping contracts (my elation is in global)


[05-Oct-23 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	68,000 CIS gross


[05-Oct-23 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	can't wait to stare at ship damage and fuel costs and cry (not actually)


[05-Oct-23 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	looks like a lucrative business venture :P


[05-Oct-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	hey, if he's willing to pay that much across multiple contracts for 896t of goods


[05-Oct-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Invincable**:	whats the best way to make money early game


[06-Oct-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	craft something simple where you can use resources you can harvest from the planet... AND to shipping contract that at least cover your fuel costs.


[06-Oct-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	Gibsin has a nice variety of resources, just not in any great production capacity. But would get you off the ground


[06-Oct-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	yeah gibson has a nice bulk of things overall but not in high quantities


[06-Oct-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Oct-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	like, the one my ships are doing?


[10-Oct-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Just something to keep in mind when you write up contracts.


[10-Oct-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	for the one i've posted, just hoping someone doesn't want to run to BEN empty for supplies


[10-Oct-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	for the ones my ships are doing? fuel cost is pretty decent compared to the actual run's rough gross


[10-Oct-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Yeah, if someone is doing a least cost run to Benten, 800 CIS would pretty much cover fuel, and put a few into the BHP jar for repairs down the road.


[10-Oct-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	that's good for them :)


[10-Oct-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	as long as my delivery meets the deadline, idm :)


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	I've got the same problem right now. Ships moving stuff for the next day and a half.


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	the shipping route i'm doing that's tying up my ships is..


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	36h one-way


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	burns ~130-150 of both fuels (i like faster runs)


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	..more like burns.. 300 the entire trip...


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	but hey! making profit according to FIN (shipping gross vs fuel cost)


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	(fuel cost in fuel use ofc)


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	last week i made 100k rev off of transport


[10-Oct-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	As long as you have enough in the tanks to make it home.


[10-Oct-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	i've got a pretty smart way of running the trips


[10-Oct-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	it's about a half tank back and forth from ETH -> BEN so


[10-Oct-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	i end up stopping at BEN on either way of my trips to top off on fuel


[10-Oct-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	pulled a big contract running full loads occasionally between PROX -> ETH


[10-Oct-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	soon i'll also be taking on ETH -> PROX return loads (i'm being subsidized for the empty loads i'm flying atm)


[10-Oct-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	I've had a couple of good runs from Benten to Antares that have worked out okay.


[10-Oct-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	you remember that massive bulk shipping load that came in a while back from BEN to ETH?


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	I remember seeing that. I was on a run that was paying an exorbitant rate to get a load somewhere that was making fuel.


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	yeah, i managed to cram ~960T into my two ships, ran it over and managed to get into a more private shipping CONT with him


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	At least, that's my best guess. What else would someone need 200 TS for?


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	perhaps some insanity pertaining to SI production instead idk


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	you see their COCG bonus?


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	I didn't think to look. I got paid, and that covered some expansion and fuel.


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	all of my income is currently in that shipping line, making BFABs on-site and slowly expanding my base here in the meantime


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Currently running BSE and looking to put up an extractor.


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	ads on the LM


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	"some" iron wasn't kidding holy


[10-Oct-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	if i had the production i'd help, i'm super small-scale atm


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Leaving one ad for someone else to fill or you can just holler if you're running low Neke


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	also neke, offering it below market rate is really gonna kill on takers


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	i usually offer at minimum 5-10% markup compared to say FE.CI1


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	usually calculate per-unit price and then incorporate it into my total for the LM offer


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	it'd be net negative for someone to fly out to benten, refuel and put money in the pot for repairs and fly back to deposit that load


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	that and uh, 100 FE is.. 7.84t/unit...


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	784t, 100m^3


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Neke is one of the ancients, I'm pretty sure he's just waiting for the old gang to help him out :) Being in a corp really helps keep costs for production down so 500 is actually already a solid offer to a lot of players


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Contacts, corps and regulars, the trifecta supreme. Plus Neke does a lot of community service out for non-pro players so always looking to help him out


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Meant to say *out of the good of his heart


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	fair point, he is in fact one of the Gs


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	if i had the iron i would take one of the orders anyways lol

[10-Oct-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@neke86, keep spinning them out. After @lowstrife gets done buying everything you produce, I'll buy the next "everything you produce". The 45 HYFs (and more to come) are going to need some repair soon. No need for RATs to get into the 140s again...

[17-Oct-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I could say: sell the fuel from one of your ships at the CX and use the money from that plus your starting money to daytrade commodities that are currently undervalued... But in reality, the best way to make money depends on a host of things. What you enjoy doing, what you're good at, how much time and effort you're willing to put into the game, to name a few.


[17-Oct-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ChickenClucker**:	My advice would be to buy enough consumables and inputs with your starting money to last a week or two. Check back every day or two to make sure your production queues are full. Take the daily government contracts if it's for something you're producing. Otherwise take the contract to ship things over to Benten, as some of these contracts never expire and you can just take all the shipments whenever you run to sell of your products and resupply. Take the small amount of money you have in the foreign currencies and buy warehouses at their CX's. Start trading some commodities to build your money in those currencies. It will take a long time, but that's okay. You won't be going to those CX's for a long time anyways. When you finally do you will have plenty of currency to make the trip worth it. Slow and steady is the best way. Don't rush to make trips to Benten constantly. Be slow and methodical, as fuel can get expensive.


[17-Oct-23 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChickenClucker**:	Look for opportunities to profit off of shipping stuff over to Arclight. It's not very common, but you may catch some good sales every now and again.


[17-Oct-23 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChickenClucker**:	Sell locally. It saves you the trip to Benten, and since it saves the other a trip to Benten, they will usually pay more.

**Hildron**:	With PRO license you can post ads on the local market. With basic license (bought PRO at least once) you can accept local market ads. So you have to find your trade partner in advance, who can post a buy order. With free license you can only sell on the CX.

[18-Oct-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	I dont mind to pay, but I dont like that only subscribed players can accept ads. So I should also hope that many people will pay too to trade with me.

[18-Oct-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	@cheeryman You are able to accept ads with basic, so it is enough to buy one month of PRO. After that you will be basic


[18-Oct-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@ChickenClucker, build a STO (storage unit, takes up base space but provides much more space) or rent a WAR (warehouse, weekly cost and lower storage space but takes up no base space)


[18-Oct-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	For the STO, open BS on left of screen, then View Base → Construct → scroll to the bottom of Infrastructure. You'll also need building materials.


[18-Oct-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	For the WAR, open a planet buffer window ("PLI JS-952c" for Gibson) → Warehouse → Rent unit. Then "open store" in the middle section of that window.

**Konvolut**:	Prolly build PRoduction building(s).  But if you didn't watch the "Transmissions" (training vids), do that first!


[21-Oct-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Depending on what profession you chose, you'd build the necessary production facility to be able to start producing your first batch

[21-Oct-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	so, what's the actual effect of being planet governor?


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grappaticus**:	genuinely curious


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	collecting taxes


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	every production run or warehouse rent goes to the governor's corp


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	however the upkeep costs are a lot for a developed planet. and an undeveloped planet wont attract pioneers and thus players to work the place


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	absolutely


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i feel like it's more of a status badge for late-game players


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	I suspect you want to be well developed with a strong cashflow to be a governor. Any current Governor's out ther want to chip in ?


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	or take a small planet and develop it from scratch


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i remember one saying that it required a lot of other contracts to be able to provision everything


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	sounds about right


[26-Oct-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	it would be interesting to do. just currently above my pay grade lol


[26-Oct-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	exactly what I'm telling myself


[26-Oct-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'm thinking of setting up on unhabited world and maybe build them up slowly as I grow


[26-Oct-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	who knows


[26-Oct-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-23 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	You can increase production per building by, for example, providing your workers with whatever consumables they ask for... But upgrading the buildings themselves isn't possible, so if you want more still you'll have to build more of them.

**uuuvster**:	Hello everyone


[04-Dec-23 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Hey there


[04-Dec-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**uuuvster**:	I plan on expanding iron production to sell more iron. Is iron a good source of income?


[04-Dec-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	There is money to be made in iron, but due to the weights involved you'll probably run into logistical problems fairly quickly. It might be easier to make use of the local CoGC bonus and turn at least some of that iron into prefabs.


[04-Dec-23 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	This is great advice.


[04-Dec-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	+1


[04-Dec-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	You can also sell FEO/FE on the Local Market here; I know I'd buy if it was a reasonable price, and you won't have to spend fuel to move the FEO/FE to the CX.


[04-Dec-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Artokun**:	my ships are running deliveries, and im nearly out of DW.CI1 and RAT.CI1. I posted some small amounts in the LM if anyone has spares!

[04-Dec-23 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**uuuvster**:	Thanks for the advice above, i already have a prefab factory built and a ship coming in from the exchange with the neccesary raw materials that i cannot produce locally. I will definetly sell iron on the local exchange when i start generating a surplus.


[04-Dec-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	if you don't have a paying licence, you won't be able to use the local exchange.  You will have to use the CX.

[04-Dec-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I remember working it out 6 months ago, and I found that COF needs to be above 5k/unit before the benefit is negated.

**JamesHart**:	hopefully you have gone throug hall the training video's, that are very helpful. create a base, create a factory, build something, sell it buy components and build some more, make money


[11-Dec-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	take shipping contracts and move stuff about for quick funds


[11-Dec-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	just be sure you are paid more than the cost of fuel


[11-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	everything takes time,  so you have the chance to plan what you want to build, from more advanced products to new bases on multiple planets, to ship upgrades and additional ships


[11-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**paprikaheart**:	i hesitated like all day to start something, but you're right. i should just do it since it takes time and all is a rather slow process.


[11-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	yep. initially no one knows anything, the chat's are full of a lot of players who are happy to help


[11-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	in your first week or so realize you are learning and you may end up saying you would prefer to restart. you can. but if you get more than a week then you have already done a lot of planning and will be less likely to want to restart


[11-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	just have fun builting your interplanetary empire !!!!


[11-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	When I first started, I was making more per day running shipping contracts than I was off my base for at least the first month, if not longer.


[11-Dec-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	What @JamesHart said, and it took me a while to discover shipping contracts !


[11-Dec-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DerMeister1**:	can anyone do shipping? Or is it only NON -Free licensees?


[11-Dec-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zerum**:	Benten carbon prices are killing me. I gotta make my own oxygen and sell the excess to make up for it


[11-Dec-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zerum**:	Doesn't help that no one will pay over 580 a unit for iron.


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	@DerMeister1 Posting on Local Markets requires pro. Accepting only requires basic... Although if I recall correctly, even free licensees can use the LM at the CX.


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	@Zerum If you have the means to do so, turning some of that FE into BSE/BBH is a profitable option.


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alako**:	Can you even set contract to be unrated


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No. Contracts need PRO or BASIC


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Seems I did not recall correctly then. Apologies.


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	BASIC can post on CX LMs


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zerum**:	@Snaevarr I do not have the means yet, but that does seem like the logical next step for me after I start up a second smelter


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Ah, had my wires crossed with that then.


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	@Zerum Worth it in general, but especially here on Gibson where the CoGC provides an additional 25% bonus to construction buildings.


[11-Dec-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zerum**:	Alright then. Time for me to enter the construction industry!

[12-Dec-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If it's with another person, you just ask them directly. In the case of faction contracts, those can't be extended as far as I'm aware.

**ProbablyAEuropean**:	Hello, How does upkeep function? If I press contribute will it just automatically pull from the base inventory?


[12-Dec-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zerum**:	Pressing contribute brings up a window where you can choose which resources of yours and how much are contributed


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Are you trying to contribute to upkeep to complete a faction contract?


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	In general, the governor and/or other more experienced players should handle the vast majority of planet upkeep.  Newer players should focus on expanding their operations and not devote scarce resources to upkeep in their early days.


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	If you get a faciton contract for upkeep contribution.....yeah, donate 1 DW or 1 PE to the COGC upkeep to complete the contract.  But that is the only reason a 3 day old account should be contributing to upkeep.


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ProbablyAEuropean**:	Ahhh I thought it was a mandatory tax


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ProbablyAEuropean**:	I was concerned because I didn't even have enough rations to pay it ._.


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	There is a "Production Tax" that you will be paying when your production lines run.  Small amounts of currency.  Those funds flow to the governor, and the governor uses them to pay the upkeep.


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	But yeah, I jumped in because I didn't want you mistakenly giving up your rations for upkeep :).


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	And .... welcome to the game!!


[12-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ProbablyAEuropean**:	Thanks for telling me that I totally was about to buy RAT and DW from the CX LOL.


[12-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ProbablyAEuropean**:	I hope i'll be contributing next time :)

[14-Dec-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you don't have a warehouse or ship on that exchange it goes into a contract (CONTS). You can pick it up once you have an inventory at that location.

[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZETTA**:	hi


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	has this planet no trade hub?


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZETTA**:	trade hub in 2 systems from here


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZETTA**:	He is in space


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	benten right?


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZETTA**:	yes


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	there is a local market on Gibson for people with a pro licence.  For people with a free licence the nearest Commodities Exchange is at Benten Station, 2 jumps from here


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	so i cant buy and sell stuff here on the planet?


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	nope.  You have to trade at the CX.  Buying what's required to produce and equip your population, then selling back the product on the market


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	so how do i know the fuel is enough for the trip to the trade hub and back?


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	when you setup your flight, the flight control dialog will warn you if there's not enough fuel for the return trip.


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and a two jump back-and-forth would be entirely feasible with a half tank of SF and a full tank of FF


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	plus, you can always buy more fuel at the CX


[21-Dec-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	There's also a flight simulator that allows you to evaluate the time and fuel and damage your ship will take for a specific flight path


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	ok thx for the infos


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	so far i checked the recommended starter buildings and it looks like it makes no sense


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	which ones ?


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	"constructor"


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	BMP & PP1 after the 2 HB1


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	okay... what part of it doesn't make sense ?


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	producing without resources + travel time + travel cost, so it would be better to focus first on resources... but i dont have BSE and MCG for it


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	okay, PrUn is a slow game, so for now let's knock travel time out of the equation


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	that leaves us with resources and travel cost...


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	travel cost just means that you'll ship less often more material, so you gotta adjust your play style...


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and that leaves us with resources.  Nearly everyone in PrUn cannot produce resources of everything... so we all need to ressuply different thing.


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	plus, some companies are so specialized that they can sell with a margin lower than I can produce myself


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	so it's more efficient to buy off the market that way


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	with a BMP you can produce MCG, which is always a popular commodity.  Most companies will need it to build on rocky planets


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and with PP1 you can produce B-fabs, which are the basic blocks for most starter buildings.


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	you just need to feed it iron and some other stuff


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	you setup a queue, and let ut churn out stuff


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and instead of selling your production, you can always consume it to build more and increase production - and profits


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	hope this helps to situation you better


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	now i know a little bit more about the system and the difference between free and paid player would it not be better setting up the company on the trading hub planet?


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	the trading hub is a space station, it's not on a planet


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	i can build the BMP and the PP1 but after a few cyles i have to stopp


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	yes i understand but its in the same system


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	flight time inside a system is only using SF, and it's a slower time than FF.


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Personnaly i don't like having to do inner-system flights.


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	in any way, if you want to try it out you can always liquidate your company and setup shop elsewhere.


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Proxion is also a good starting point: one jump away from Benten, and you'll be able to farm and produce rations


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	you just gotta import water.  Do not try to pump water locally - it's a waste of time


[21-Dec-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Server Maintenance occuring soon... imma go do some other stuff for now :P

**PiBoy314**:	You can zoom in with Ctrl + +


[21-Dec-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But not on the Steam version


[21-Dec-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	(You should probably be playing on the browser anyways, Steam doesn't offer any real benefits)


[21-Dec-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	so there is no options for font size ?


[21-Dec-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No. Not in and of itself.


[21-Dec-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But as there are no graphics in this game, zooming in IS changing the font size

[22-Dec-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Probably it is in a contract. In that case you can click on the button titled "CONT" on the left sidebar. Then navigate to that contract and click "Fulfill" on the pickup condition. If it's not that, could you give the exact wording?

**Xentarus**:	i dont hope so, my young company struggle with this kind of overpriced FE


[25-Dec-23 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I realise this might sound a bit "let them eat cake" -ish, but switching to PP2s is usually a good idea for the weight savings alone. Prices fluctuate, so AL isn't always cheaper than FE, but for now it is.


[25-Dec-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I would always produce bfabs and lfabs only with own FE/AL

**xensored**:	buying from CX destroys your margin


[25-Dec-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	haha let them eat cake... my situation atm is hard, but its ok. i had the same idea btw and planned a base with PP2 in prunplanner


[25-Dec-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	found a few days a product that makes 15k+ a day today its -22k a day in prunpanner.... kind of shocking


[25-Dec-23 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	you can plan as a beginner as much as you can but if the market punch you in the face it hurts because you have nothing left than your starter money & material

[26-Dec-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xentarus**:	free = you cant create contracts or create ads for the local market


[26-Dec-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Basic, which is what one falls back to after pro expires, still allows for accepting ads that others have posted.

**I_am_Tex**:	if you have, you are probably in a wait period for those orders to complete.  You can plot for universal domination, trade on the exchanges, explore the game tools like Prun Planner, etc.

[26-Jan-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Hey there. Yup, Gibson has a Local Market. The selection of things on offer at local markets tends to be rather limited though. If you want a greater selection of goods, you might want to check out the Commodity Exchange in Benten.


[26-Jan-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**redwoch**:	oh, okay I just started and have no idea of what I'm doing xd where can I find this market?


[26-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Maverick25** deleted this message.*


[26-Jan-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Maverick25**:	Hi redwoch!, you have the market if you use the CMD "LM JS-952c"


[26-Jan-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	note: the local market is only available to people with a PRO license.


[26-Jan-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Maverick25**:	oh...so if you dont have the PRO what i need do to buy things?


[26-Jan-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	As mentioned, the Commodity Exchange at Benten has all materials and does not require PRO. The only downside is that it's a little further away (12h to 24h, depending on fuel usage).


[26-Jan-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	there are 6 commodity markets, which are open to everyone


[26-Jan-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the CXL command will list all of the commodity markets


[26-Jan-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Maverick25**:	thx!


[26-Jan-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the closest one to us in Benton Station


[26-Jan-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the "CX CI1" command will show you what's available at that market, and from that window you can place buy/sell orders


[26-Jan-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and don't forget that you'll have to fly a ship to the market to pickup your stuff


[26-Jan-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Maverick25**:	i need make a trade offer to buy something i need?


[26-Jan-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you buy things with money.  there are 4 in-game currencies


[26-Jan-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	in our part of the universe, the common one is CIS.   If you click the "SDBR" button (on the far left side of your screen, if you're in a desktop browser), you can see your balance


[26-Jan-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the general game loop is:  you buy some materials at the market, use a production line at your base to turn it into a more valuable thing, and then sell that more valuable thing


[26-Jan-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	eventually you get enough money to expand you base (or build additional bases), or you build builds to mine the raw resources.   but the basic loop stays the same

**Konvolut**:	You will also probably want to gather raw Resources from each Planet where you have a Base.


[26-Jan-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Here on Gibson, the most profitable Resource is FEO, so you will prolly want to build an EXT to dig the ore (rather than buying it with money you don't have [yet]).


[26-Jan-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	When I started, I also built COL and RIG, to gather O & H2O, but it *might* be better to buy those, because those Resources are kinda weak here.


[26-Jan-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Also, Gibson is has Real Dirt - "Soil Fertility" - so you prolly want to build FRMs to grow Ag products to make your own food ("RAT") in an FP.


[26-Jan-24 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Oh, yeah, before you do anything in this Game, watch the "Transmissions" (see Help).  PU has a steep learning curve, but it generally makes sense.

[26-Jan-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Digital7**:	well now you just need to wait


[26-Jan-24 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**James_Bankz**:	Will the starter/intro contracts give me enough to do while I get used to everything?


[26-Jan-24 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Digital7**:	I am wondering if you can accept player contracts as a new player, but these days there is a lot of shipping contracts out of Benten Station


[26-Jan-24 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Digital7**:	Oh and also, players can give you loans, it might actually make sense as a new player to find sombody to give you a loan


[26-Jan-24 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**James_Bankz**:	Will look into it. Still figuring it all out. Need to tame all these screens.


[26-Jan-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Sorry to spoil the broth, but I don't agree with @Konvolut at all. I feel it's much better to focus your bases to the COGC and either buy locally what you need (pay someone else a premium to mine for you) or ship in what you need.


[27-Jan-24 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I easily ran 12 bases with the 2 starter ships, and I know of others who managed 18 bases (though not easily at that point).


[27-Jan-24 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The best way to get yourself up to speed is to approach a Dragon and offer them a proposal to get them to help with your expansion.


[27-Jan-24 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	There are people on Deimos advertising a Project where they will build your base for you and give you an equal share of the products produced, just for you to feed ALO into their Project.


[27-Jan-24 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The governor of Promitor was helping new players upgrade their starter ships a while ago (not sure if he's still doing it but you can ask). Going from a starter ship to a WCB is a game-changer and will give you a massive boost.


[27-Jan-24 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Well, my opinion is: the fastest way to make money is to use someone else's, and there are a lot of Dragons sitting on hoards of gold in this game. And a lot of them like to help new players.

[27-Jan-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Hmm, I have 33,301 NFI.CI1 here that I will never use, does anyone want to make a bid for them?


[27-Jan-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	yes i produce MHL only for own needs qnd rest of the time TRU


[27-Jan-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yeah, I dumped A LOT into the market, as can be seen in the leaderboards, but it's a complex supply chain to keep costs down


[27-Jan-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And there seemed to be no smaller players interested in setting up HYFs


[27-Jan-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I got the same story with HSE & AEF.


[27-Jan-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	But I definitely believe the baseball motto of "build it and they will come". Especially if your price is good.


[27-Jan-24 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yeah, I mean, I sold about 8,000 units over the last 6 months. They definitely bought them - I'm just producing too many haha


[27-Jan-24 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	when I started, the prices on the LM were 3.5K to 4K per unit


[27-Jan-24 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Now they're steadily changing hands at 2.2-2.8K


[27-Jan-24 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Hmm actually the chart shows it hasn't changed that much


[27-Jan-24 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	so we'll see what happens


[27-Jan-24 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	No I was right the first time, I just needed to look at all the exchanges. September-October '23 there were significant demand for MHL pushed prices generally higher across the exchanges


[27-Jan-24 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Looks like it might be returning again now on NC1.. I guess the 90-120-day repair period is cycling back around


[27-Jan-24 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	yes at the moment there seems to be a monthly period between up an down. lets see if it will go up without your production

**Kindling**:	I've been making my own MHLs, b.c the CX prices seemed way too high at up to 4k/u. But if I can get them for as low as 2.2k/u I might just ditch my own production and buy them instead. Our internal corp prices are not that much lower either at that point 😃


[27-Jan-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aem**:	2.2/u sounds pretty high to me, although I have absolutely no reference, i'm pretty new

**Konvolut**:	Paris is not wrong ("fastest way to make money is to use someone else's"), but IMO, starting small (and *poor*) forces a deeper understanding of (1) the mechanics of the game and (2) the reality of How Money Works.


[27-Jan-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Once you get your feet under you, get your Home base built up a bit, and are starting to think about building a 2nd Base - that's the time to look for loans from Big Dogs.


[27-Jan-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Something about the thought of owing someone else seems to trigger the majority of players to take things more seriously at that point.


[27-Jan-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	(Obviously, they've also gone PRO at that point, so they were already taking it more seriously. But I feel things accelerate).

**KurisuMurei**:	It's probably worth adjusting your strategy based off of what the markets are doing, and also factoring in building wear, area limits, and worker requirements. The latter two make it somewhat impractical to keep a building idle 'just in case'.

**PiBoy314**:	@Incubugs likely you have the materials to make PE right now. You can queue that in your BMP. I would then recommend flying to the commodity exchange station BEN to buy more materials and maybe another building.


[10-Feb-24 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Definitely pick up PWO and COF as they will make your production more efficient.

**gttyub27**:	how you doing?


[23-Feb-24 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	1st day. I ordered some Aluminum at another base. Flew there and did the tutorial RAT purchase.


[23-Feb-24 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	But I onoly see the RAT in my Cargo Hold


[23-Feb-24 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	hmm i don't know what to do about that. maybe you couldn't buy it because of a lack of funds? also what's the difference between the current funds and liquid funds?


[23-Feb-24 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	When I purchased the order was filled. And I deleted 3 filled orders. 2 that I did on Aluminum and 1 for RAT


[23-Feb-24 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Is there another place to see goods you own?


[23-Feb-24 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Im looking in inventory. I dont see it.


[23-Feb-24 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Ill just order again. lol Was a newbie order to see how it works anyhow


[23-Feb-24 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	check your contracts. also do you have a warehouse?


[23-Feb-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Ive literally played for less than 2 hours


[23-Feb-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Oh


[23-Feb-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Its in Contracts


[23-Feb-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	because the order might be within the contract page and you need a warehouse to store it


[23-Feb-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Status Closed


[23-Feb-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	okay


[23-Feb-24 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Had to click the fullfill button


[23-Feb-24 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Awesome, it was in Contracts .. ty


[23-Feb-24 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	no problem


[23-Feb-24 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	i figured that it would be a neat idea to rent a warehouse unit so that i don't have to go into the contracts screen every time. do you know how to rent a warehouse unit?


[23-Feb-24 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	No. lol Then your orders go right to your warehouse at that base?


[23-Feb-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	not at base but at the market place


[23-Feb-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	I still have to fly over and pick them up


[23-Feb-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	yes


[23-Feb-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	So what does it do different?


[23-Feb-24 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	not having to pop up the contract screen. it's also really simple to transfer everything that way


[23-Feb-24 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	I got ya. Where do I find the WH?


[23-Feb-24 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	you were buying from a commodity exchange yea?


[23-Feb-24 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Yes


[23-Feb-24 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	go to that screen and then within the infrastructure area it will say ___ station warehouse. click on it and then rent a unit.


[23-Feb-24 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Ah... got it.. ty


[23-Feb-24 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Cheap too


[23-Feb-24 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**gttyub27**:	you do pay weekly though. but it shouldn't be too hard for upkeep


[23-Feb-24 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	right..


[23-Feb-24 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ch0zen1**:	Ok off to bed. thx for the help


[23-Feb-24 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Joanna_Hart**:	can't, has to be on a surface


[24-Feb-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	if it can't land, and can't leave the system, it's effectively stuck without dev intervention


[24-Feb-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vinurd**:	ооо


[24-Feb-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	if it had fuel in its own hold, it could refuel that way, but ship-to-ship transfers MUST be done while both are landed


[24-Feb-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vinurd**:	is there any way to quickly buy resources for the base?


[24-Feb-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	the CX?


[24-Feb-24 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vinurd**:	Illegal command


[24-Feb-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	i mean you'd have to visit the cx


[24-Feb-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the cloest commodity exchange is Benton Station, which is where you will buy the vast majorty of the stuff you need


[24-Feb-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vinurd**:	I sent a ship there. I hope to be able to buy something


[24-Feb-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vinurd**:	Thanks for the guidance

**MarkBlaireau**:	Even this universe appears to have vulgar, ill-mannered trolls. Usually, if there is no reaction, they get bored and move along. That said, looking at their company name, and how the letter q is typically pronounced as a k, my caffeine-deprived brain read that as black knickers, which tells me they need to change their underwear more often.

[06-Mar-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	to be honest, i don't think you have a capability to haul 500 units :)


[06-Mar-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**InfernoMan**:	I checked, you're right, I did not realize that limestone was that heavy.


[06-Mar-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Mar-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Mar-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Mar-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you've got time to wait you can probably get it for cheaper by putting a buy on the CX for ~550

[12-Apr-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	sure, i can supply that


[12-Apr-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Could you do 100 MCG, 4 BSE, and 6 BBH?


[12-Apr-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep


[12-Apr-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Wonderful! I'm seeing 22.5k estimated price on prunplanner but I think that's for buy value in benten. Is 30-35k reasonable for me saving shipping time and accounting for ask prices?


[12-Apr-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Also if anyone makes FE locally or sources LST nearby somehow I'd love to buy directly and save us both on shipping to Benten


[12-Apr-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no, that's too much


[12-Apr-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	let's do 2k each for BBH, 1.5k each for BSE, and 25 each for MCG


[12-Apr-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Johiah**:	And those prices are perfectly fine to me!


[12-Apr-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ok, either put up ads on the local market, or 3 direct contracts to me, whatever you prefer


[12-Apr-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	I'll make 3 contracts I think


[12-Apr-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	though if people do actually check the local market for stuff like that I'll probably use it in future for sourcing iron or whatever?


[12-Apr-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Am still very new to this game lol


[12-Apr-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it depends on the planet and the person.  here on gibson, i check the LM a few times a day


[12-Apr-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Does that contract look right?


[12-Apr-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	your original proposed prices were way above CX prices, and if you placed those buy orders on the LM, i'm sure they'd be filled very quickly


[12-Apr-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Thanks for da trade and sorry @MarkBlaireau for kinda swamping your message


[12-Apr-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you're welcome, and also welcome to Gibson


[12-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	thx


[12-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	so I've heard the number 15 credits per ton transported, I think?


[12-Apr-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Does that mean that if I price iron on the local market at ~110 below the ask price in benten, selling it here makes more sense than shippign?


[12-Apr-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Not like as the actual cost of shipping but as the number people have used as a baseline for pricing shipping contracts


[12-Apr-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm not really aware of ay standard prices for shipping.  15 CIS per ton might be the right ballpark, but it's going to vary a lot.  and it's going to depend on how far the delivery is


[12-Apr-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	I guess I could just put some test posts up at various prices and see which fill


[12-Apr-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It also depends on opportunity cost. If your ships are sitting idle with no shipping contracts, it only costs the fuel to get there and back.


[12-Apr-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And, from the perspective of someone buying from the market it’s the same. They’d have to pay that 15CIS/t to get it back


[12-Apr-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	since you're just starting out, your two starter ships should be more than capable of hauling everything you need


[12-Apr-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Generally, selling at or only slightly under market rate is doable


[12-Apr-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Actually one of my ships is heading off to near Hubur right now


[12-Apr-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	110 under seems boarderline unprofitable in an industry with already very slim margins


[12-Apr-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	in game, there is no way for someone to advertise "i have X tons free for hauling" so there's no good way to knowing in general how much free space is moving around between systems


[12-Apr-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Well I'd imagine anyone making iron purely to ship it is having lots of fun with fuel costs if they're taking it to benten


[12-Apr-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yeah. Generally selling iron especially on the market is unprofitable or barely profitable


[12-Apr-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	huh benten has the highest ask price for FE by a signiicant margin to any of the other CXs


[12-Apr-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i made a blueprint for a ship that would let me haul 3000 tons, and last i checked (a few months ago), it would probably cost 2 million CIS to upgrade.   which isn't an unreachable amount of cash, but it's large enough that not everyone does it


[12-Apr-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	BTW, if your producing FE on gibson, consider building some PP1 construction buildings to turn it into BSE/BBH/BTA


[12-Apr-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	yeah I have the PP1 and wanna buy iron from someone else locally lol


[12-Apr-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	why not extract and smelt it yourself?


[12-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	if I had the money for buildings with a lower return I'd just run out of space by making higher return buildings


[12-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	and I don't have the money to spare on lower return stuff so


[12-Apr-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	but if my orders in benten keep not filling I might just have to


[12-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	maybe I can work out a deal with someone for iron at like 670 in exchange for discounted construction stuff


[12-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	by "lower return" are you just looking at the price to sell FE.CI1 ?


[12-Apr-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	shipping is worth it if I can get at buy order price


[12-Apr-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	next preferred would be working out a deal with someone


[12-Apr-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	last would be making it myself


[12-Apr-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	I'd like to not split experts if I can


[12-Apr-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	is your FE primarily going into BSE/BBH ?


[12-Apr-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	mhmm


[12-Apr-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	that's rough because LST is also heavy has heck :)


[12-Apr-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i ship it in from far away, and i hate it


[12-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Thus me wanting to maybe find a local fren for iron lol


[12-Apr-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	then it's just limestone coming in


[12-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	I put an ad up at 680 and if someone bites I'll message them about a longer term partnership ig


[12-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	shipping cost is 19 per unit one way with a completely full ship


[12-Apr-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	also you selling that stuff to me was extremely helpful


[12-Apr-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Apr-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	How does anyone make a profit on BTA btw?


[12-Apr-24 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Supply:Demand seems 5:1 and prunplanner shows a massive loss


[12-Apr-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this number isn't perfectly accurate, but prunplanner says i can make BTA at 1140 per unit, which is less than the current offers


[12-Apr-24 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so it's not profitable for me to sell the BTA this i make, but i make BTA for my own consumption


[12-Apr-24 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	But bid price is 900?


[12-Apr-24 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	It's not super huge to transport either


[12-Apr-24 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, so like i said, i don't sell BTA


[12-Apr-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	But shipping aside you're spending 1140 to make it instead of buying it at 900 from an oversaturated market?


[12-Apr-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but the 7 day average is actually up around 1300


[12-Apr-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	What am I missing here


[12-Apr-24 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i can't necessarily buy at 900


[12-Apr-24 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	hmm actually I can't fully read the price charts in this game yet


[12-Apr-24 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	BTA's 7 day has some sudden really wide green days


[12-Apr-24 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	are those the only days that something actually sold around 900?


[12-Apr-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it's moved at 900, but not that often.  if i place a buy order at 900, it might take weeks for that that be to fullfilled.  i'd have to pay 1300 if i wanted to buy instantly


[12-Apr-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	gotcha


[12-Apr-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Despite the overabundance of sellers?


[12-Apr-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	People are patient I guess when the only fee for holding onto stuff is opportunity cost


[12-Apr-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you look at the 180 day price chart for BTA, it has never traded over 1500.  we don't know how long that offer of 151 at 1500 has been on the books, but my guess it's been there for many many months


[12-Apr-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Clearly they should make stuff listed for sale take up space in the warehouse


[12-Apr-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	(I am aware many people play this game casually for number go up)


[12-Apr-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	I do wish there was a hardcore market game I could replace eve with tho


[12-Apr-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, people do sometimes list stuff on the market at high prices just to get access to free storage


[12-Apr-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	It would make the market a good deal more usable, though, I think


[12-Apr-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	how big can a station warehouse get?


[12-Apr-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	IMO a 5:1 supply to demand gap where prices don't fall because there's no incentive to sell is an economy and game health problem


[12-Apr-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	but I am also only an armchair economist


[12-Apr-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm not sure how many warehouses you can rent at benten


[12-Apr-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	I see a 1/1000 listed in the warehouse menu O.o


[12-Apr-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	you can rent 1000 warehouses


[12-Apr-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	good golly


[12-Apr-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	with 500k capacity


[12-Apr-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	and a 50k weekly fee


[12-Apr-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	so actually


[12-Apr-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	making things listed for sale take up space may genuinely help the health of the game


[12-Apr-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Apr-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	hold on lemme ask him if 500k is worth a budding friendship


[12-Apr-24 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Also does this game have a contacts system beyond leaving chats with people open?


[12-Apr-24 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Apr-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lguth3728**:	so how to I upgrade my base


[12-Apr-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	do you mean like upgrading your hq for more permits or just generally improving your base


[12-Apr-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	Also I would recommend checking out the help channel in the discord as well as the help channel in game if you're new to this kind of game

**PiBoy314**:	Yes, it is about that. No, there’s no way to upgrade ships without pro, but your starter ships will serve you well enough for the first few months


[14-Apr-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The Upgrade on your HQ tab upgrades your HQ, giving you more permits to make more bases

[14-Apr-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	once you upgrade your HQ (via the `HQ`) command, you immediately get a new permit to either expand an existing base, or to build a new base.  you can expand existing bases (at most 2 times) via the `BS` command

[15-Apr-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you have PE, i can sell you 250 units of PG at half price (so 5k CIS total) -- does that help?


[15-Apr-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	will they still eat supplies while not running, or just building degradation?


[15-Apr-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	no problem


[18-Apr-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	i have ships moving and one otw to Benten, but I ran out of limestone and productions were going to stop for a while so I wanted to avoid that xD


[18-Apr-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	none on hand, but I can grab some for ya with my benten ship


[18-Apr-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	day 1 metalurgist.  should I be buying carbon/oxygen so I can continue to smelt iron?


[18-Apr-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	yeah, and flux so you get more out of each cycle of ore


[18-Apr-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	if you're willing to devote the space for it, 1 collector can fuel like 5 smelters, so you'll be self-sufficient on Gibson... but eventually you


[18-Apr-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	will want to look into making construction stuff, Bfabs and such from the PP1


[18-Apr-24 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Johiah**:	and now going the other way, I've got 390/390 of open space if anyone wants to send something to benten


[18-Apr-24 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**s.a.y.**:	If I build a FRM on Gibson to produce C, will that work? Or is there nothing to be made out of water on this planet besides DW?


[19-Apr-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	You pretty much can make enough C on Gibson to keep a SME fed with one FRM.


[19-Apr-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**s.a.y.**:	Thanks!!!


[19-Apr-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	At the risk of stating the obvious, but only provided you also have an INC to actually burn the farm products in.


[19-Apr-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	It's how I got started out here on Gibson. A little bit hardscrabble to start, but, it is possible.


[19-Apr-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**s.a.y.**:	I don't have FRM and INC right now, but that's in the near future


[19-Apr-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	You may want to have a collector at some point. The hydrogen production isn't anything to write home about, but PE is useful stuff with RCO from a FRM.


[19-Apr-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**s.a.y.**:	where do the pioneers come from? right now i have a requirement of 140/200. when i need more people, will it be enough to build another HB1?


[19-Apr-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Pioneers show up in response to jobs available. More production facilities, more jobs. Then  you'll need more housing.


[19-Apr-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Each HB1 provides living space for 100 pioneers.


[19-Apr-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**s.a.y.**:	I thought so, it's a good thing they don't have to be imported)))


[19-Apr-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	They do have to be fed, so, you'll be importing RAT and other consumables until you get things running to make those basic needs.


[19-Apr-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**s.a.y.**:	That's right. I'm hoping to get over this problem.


[19-Apr-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	It just takes time and careful management.

**xensored**:	If you have products to sell here on Gibson and need to ship them to BEN CX, you should be able to create a shipping contract on BEN CX local market. You can create it to let someone ship your products from Gibson to BEN for 1 CIS. I can take it with me later when my ships arrives and transport it to BEN. Then you sell it and have cash again


[27-Apr-24 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zvbura**:	wait wait wait, so i started my first production Q starting with iron ore making iron. 16h for 7 units. does that sound right??


[12-May-24 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KurisuMurei**:	Doesn't sound like Iron. It's usually in multiples of 3 or 4, and the recipe for 3 is 12h, while the recipe for 4 is 14.2h


[12-May-24 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KurisuMurei**:	Unless that's the iron ore extraction part, which is more likely.


[12-May-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KurisuMurei**:	But yeah, it does take a while in real time to get stuff going.


[12-May-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zvbura**:	Yes, the extraction part. with the smelting section being 14h per order

[12-May-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

**mrcoffee09**:	@Zvbura I just started 24 days ago with the smelting/mining iron ore.  I've got 6 production lines and I end up going back and forth to the trade hub every 5 days or so.  It's slow to build, but if you like this kind of thing it has been a good game

[13-May-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	it will then divide the tile that's already there in half, then you can resize as wanted


[13-May-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Felmer**:	I like to step down from the governor position. If someone is willing and interested to step in, I would withdraw from the running election which should allow someone else to get voted. If not i would fullfil the upcoming term. In both cases i will provide 1M CIS as starting funds for the next governor.

[13-May-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**iagoDoc**:	is it very time consuming acting as a governor? 'm positive I couldn't do it since I have no idea about prety much anything works in the gameyet, but even if I knew everything there is to know I feel I wouldn't have the time...


[14-May-24 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	and the logical follow up question: how long would it take for anyone willing to learn to play such role to get to the point where they would make a decent performance as a governor? I'm guessing there is some wiki out there explaining the role's mechanic


[14-May-24 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	I wouldn't run myself but maybe this information helps someone who is trying to make his mind about running or not

**Augmented**:	Doc I wouldn't bet on finding a wiki lmao. Your best bet is asking in global or in a site owner chat like this one, very little in the way of wikis and guides online. Second best would be a discord of some kind. The playerbase is really friendly and super helpful. I'm also too new to know all the ins and outs but those have been my best bet for figuring out how to play/what to do.

**Shadowz121**:	How do you decide what to do next?  I am looking at technician level production and it looks like there is no demand for it (manufacturing)


[29-May-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	there is a lot of demand for those higher tier materials its just that they are not traded on the cx


[29-May-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	How do I figure out the demand if its not on the cx?


[29-May-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	if u press info or check the chart u can see previous demmand and supply for a material


[29-May-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Doesn't that only tell you what moves through the cx?


[29-May-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	i would stay away from technicans and above until u are rly familar with pioneers and settlers since technicans and above have rly expensive and hard to source consumables


[29-May-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	yes but if its not moving through the cx u have to seek out a player


[29-May-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I was hoping to take advantage of my experts, and will have queue issues if I make more of the lower tier products


[29-May-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	do u know what prunplanner is? i would look into that when designing bases


[29-May-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I use it, but for profit calculation I can only use it for stuff on the CX, so if the demand isn't at the CX it looks unprofitable


[29-May-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	it lets u compare different setups quickly and lets u verify that u are not overproducing or overconsuming something, usaully people use experts to allow them manange surpluses and deficiets


[29-May-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	yah thats usaully how it goes unless u can find some non-cx player demmand its best to try to produce stuff to sell on the cx


[29-May-24 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	right, which brings me back to it looks like technicians and above there isn't a steady demand on the CX, so I can't really justify investing in it

**iagoDoc**:	quick question: i've just place my first foreign exchange order to buy ICA using CIS. Isn't it instantaneous? I've seen my liquidity reduced in CIS but it hasn't changed in ICA at all


[30-May-24 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	might not be much... but those 14k CIS were like 60% of my liquidity ^_^'


[30-May-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you're buying at the ask price (1.0180), you'll be filled immediately. By using bid, you'll have to wait until someone is willing to sell to you at that price.

**iagoDoc**:	1:1


[30-May-24 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	@iagoDoc Aye, you're not wrong. I can see your order in the ICA/CIS order book.


[30-May-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	It's easy to miss, but the set price buttons for forex and for commodities are slightly different. For regular goods, you can use set price buttons for the average, bid, and ask prices. For forex, the only set price button is for the current price, which is the last traded price (and not the ask price).

[30-May-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-May-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	excuse me if this question is dumb but I'm really puzzled... why would one want to rip a base down and rebuilt it later?


[31-May-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Someone might plop down a base on, say, a CUO planet in order to produce a year's worth of SCN. After that's done, the base can be torn down and the permit used somewhere else.


[31-May-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Might not be the most efficient way of going about things, but I know of a few who've done something like that.


[31-May-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	i get it. permits are hard to come by then?


[31-May-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Not really, at first. They become the main thing slowing you down later on.


[31-May-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	They're tied to your HQ level, and each upgrade requires more materials. There's a list of HQ upgrade costs here - you can see how things balloon:

**FireFreak**:	nope, doesnt matter


[03-Jun-24 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	good :) thank you


[03-Jun-24 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	look into you contracts @iagoDoc ;) Don't have them on Gibson right now, but I can provide them on BEN for you

**kerbosos**:	Are contracts actually important?


[03-Jun-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	thanks a lot xensored


[03-Jun-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no, faction contracts are not that important.   but sometimes they'll ask you to provide a thing and pay you more than maket prices for it.  so if you're already making a trip to the CX, it's basically free money


[03-Jun-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and sometimes you get really weird faction contracts like https://up.em32.site/Bcpz.png -- so i always try read every faction contract in case it's a good one, even if i don't accept most of them

**iagoDoc**:	i guess faction contracts are just usefull to us newbies because basically they show us the ropes of the game


[03-Jun-24 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	a question about ETA of flights: I've noticed that sometimes I've dialed down the % of motor usage (it doesn't matter if FTL or STL) but surprisingly the ETA has algo gone down. I can only guess this is a misscalculation on the server side due to traffic. Does it happen often?


[03-Jun-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm not sure if this is a bug or not (i think it is a bug), but for all flights, the flight computer can compute two different paths (with two different travel times and fuel usage).  you can sometimes jump between them by just clicking on one of the FTL/STL sliders


[03-Jun-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this is seen more often during FTL flights, but can also happen with only STL flights


[03-Jun-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**kerbosos**:	Yeah, I've noticed that too


[03-Jun-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	sooooooooo


[03-Jun-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	stl and ftl are the same bug, but it only leads to objectively better routes on FTL flights


[03-Jun-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	for STL it will use more/less fuel for faster/slower flight


[03-Jun-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	when flying STL only and you suddenly see a much shorter flight time, make sure to check fuel used because its likely much higher than you intended to set it


[03-Jun-24 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	damn i thought thatt was an intended feature


[03-Jun-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	i thought it just had to do with the starting and ending points of the planets orbit


[03-Jun-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	nah, orbits have nothing to do with it


[03-Jun-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	its the STL segments where SF gets shifted around and one configuration is usually significantly better than the other


[03-Jun-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	you can look at it as it happens in the flight segments


[03-Jun-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	for FTL flights*


[03-Jun-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	uve ruined my appreciation of the orbital mechanics of this game. u have no idea how deeply it saddens me that ive been abusing a bug instead of a feature lmao


[03-Jun-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	as a trade-off I offer you this: you can open up the system map when plotting a flight and see the flight path, especially nice for STL only flights


[03-Jun-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	only real flights, though, not BLU flights


[03-Jun-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jun-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zura**:	Certainly got all the "essentials" - nothing additional though (coffee etc), for reference it's 4000 units of PE


[07-Jun-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zura**:	(And an efficiency of 102% according to the production line)


[07-Jun-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	5 days is possible if you submitted a large order size


[07-Jun-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	aye, if you're making 4000 units of PE, that's an order size of 20 (takes 4 days and 4 hours on my base)


[07-Jun-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	larger order sizes always the same efficiency as smaller order sizes.  for me personally, i tailor my order sizes based on how often i want materials (since you can only pick up the output materials when the entire order is finished)

Also, now that it's been mentioned, I've noticed I contributed like once or twice to that "popi" but I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing (it was a faction mission requirement). I will try to provide with something from now (on every term? or how often?)

**iagoDoc**:	I mean... pro players, we play a fee of real money to play, everything we get in game is worth only a fraction of that money (it's not a lot, to be honest). The main reason to not no invest a lot is the cost of oportunity, that will hinder your advance. But a small chung of everyone's afordable mats i will guess it's a lot all together

**kerbosos**:	Was trying to buy TCL on the CX2, the ask is 3200 and there's no bid, wanted to buy 30 TCL for 3200 per piece, for some reason I can't, I'm still getting that message


[13-Jun-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	make sure you didn't accidentally try to buy 3200 units at 30CIS


[13-Jun-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you're still having problems, send us a screenshot of what you see


[13-Jun-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Nah, the last order for TCL to be filled at Arc CX was at 100 CIS, forcing the "acceptable" band down to an unrealistic level.

**kerbosos**:	So... I can't buy TCL, because the game wants to protect me from "overpaying"?

**Azora**:	Hello guys, I'm new to the game and kinda lost on how I can build things. I have very few ressources. I started by building 2 Pioneer Habitation, should have I not ?


[13-Jun-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azora**:	Cause now, I cannot build any ressource extractor


[13-Jun-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	do you still have enough money to buy the necessary components to build an extractor?

**SyderWolf**:	Just a quick question, when it says "provisioning of xyz" in a contract am i the one providing xyz or am i being provided xyz


[13-Jun-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ASimpleToaster**:	You're the one providing. IE if it says "Provisioning of 50 Oxygen", then to complete the contract, you'll need to have 50 units Oxygen available where the contract states it will be picked up from.


[13-Jun-24 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	i mean... it makes sense. I'm not there yet but I guess if you're producing high end stuff you can afford those

**Snaevarr**:	@iagoDoc Gibson has been Benten's construction planet since the beginning. It has all green environmentals, true, but in terms of resources it's pretty unremarkable. Especially when one considers that there are other planets nearby that specialise in metallurgy. Brokkraf, Giedi Prime and Ementior come to mind.


[18-Jun-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	also, because gibson has always been construction, a lot of people have built bases around construction, so they're not willing to change it

**wickskiracer**:	Hi, I am the new governor. I was not able to communicate until now because I have just started a base here allowing me to talk to you all. Firstly, the change of governmental responsibilities to me was very rushed and on short notice. Secondly, a couple of the products (MHP & HOG) are difficult to produce. As a result of this I have spent many hours setting up a plan and networking in order to get the materials to produce said resources. This will allow me to bring them to you for as cheaply as I can. (A big thank you to those who have given a temporary supply until I can get the bases up and running) Third is taxes, I am balancing taxes based on “Archiel’s Good Governor Helper” as well as prices from the CORP I am a part of (KAWA). They have been a big help in bringing you cheaper materials for planetary upkeep, allowing me to keep taxes as low as possible. Unfortunately, keeping the taxes at the minimum as the previous governor had them is not possible for me as I can not afford that


[20-Jun-24 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**wickskiracer**:	Finally, this is my first time governing a planet so please bear with me. Also feel free to reach out to me here on PRUN or on discord @wickskiracer. Thank you!

**iagoDoc**:	not inmediately, but yes. When you post the ad nothing happens. Then, after someone accepts it you have to provide those materials, wich means they will be blocked in your base until the other party picks them upthe materials

**Augmented**:	Did bro think he was playing a RTS? idk how you can read the website or any reviews/descriptions and think you're getting something else besides a sim tbh.


[25-Jun-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**UltraTrade**:	It's an extremely DEEP game once one takes more than a 15 minute look at it. However I think there's a very small overlap between adrenaline gamers and spreadsheet gamers.  I still miss SWG for that depth. Luckily for me, I'm ProsU's target audience.

**Odysseus6**:	When you first start, do you basically do 5 minutes worth of stuff and then have to wait for 16 hours for production to finish?


[29-Jun-24 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep


[29-Jun-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jun-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but as you expand your base (and get more bases), there's more stuff to do


[29-Jun-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jun-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if this ends up being the type of game you like, sometimes you do 5 minutes worth of stuff, and then an hour of planning for next day :)

[29-Jun-24 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jun-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**zarkthepirate**:	Where do i pick up the supplies for my first contract? It says at Ebisu but I don't know where


[03-Jul-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	are you trying to fulfill a faction contract ?


[03-Jul-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zarkthepirate**:	I guess it's a tutorial contract, second contract I've had, from the Minister of Balance


[03-Jul-24 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ok, it probably wants you to deliver some materials to "Ebisu - Gibson" which is planet you're on.    Ebisu is the name of the system, and Gibson is the name of the planet


[03-Jul-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zarkthepirate**:	It specifically says to pick up 20 / 20 units of Drinking Water at Ebisu - Gibson (JS-952c)


[03-Jul-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	when you open the contract, do you have a green "fulfill" button you can click?


[03-Jul-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zarkthepirate**:	No


[03-Jul-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zarkthepirate**:	Never mind


[03-Jul-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zarkthepirate**:	That answered my question, thanks


[03-Jul-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zarkthepirate**:	Didn't see the "Depends on" section


[03-Jul-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the other thing to keep an eye on is the "Party" column in the contract.  it'll normally say who is supposed to do the action.  if it's blank, it means that you do the action

[04-Jul-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	I am not a power hungry person. I was born in Gibson. Unlike most of players I haven't COLIQd. I switched from Metallurgy to Construction and started to go through. It was tough, not an easy path like Promitor.


[04-Jul-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	I don't want to take away a post from new governor. Honestly I doubt I will get it even if I want :D


[04-Jul-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	But I don't mind to become a gov member, so if you don't know who to support: vote for me or wickskiracer


[04-Jul-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptColeslaw**:	I'll speak on behalf of a few people on the ballot. Wickskiracer took on the challenge of governing Gibson recently after the previous governor stepped back. But it's one of many many planets that KAWA now takes responsibility for. We aim to use our lower internal prices to keep taxes lower than what they would be at CX rates, and to upgrade buildings as desired/needed. We've got a whole team of people who help each other out to make sure that workforces are managed effectively and upkeep is on time. So if you see KAWA beside the name of any candidate know that they're backed by a whole corporation with a history of growing planets in the Benten are effetively


[04-Jul-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	KAWA currently governs over 1 million total population between all planets, including Katoa, Proxion, Umbra, Uponor, Milliways, and more. We're a big group governing a lot of places, but we're not here to 'take over', we're here to support the growth of the region. So if you have any issues just let us know <3

[09-Jul-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	no all transport is player driven


[09-Jul-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	shipping contract*


[09-Jul-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**asaphx**:	ah nice


[09-Jul-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**asaphx**:	so how come I don't see more players offering this service?


[09-Jul-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	There is no need to offer. Client posts ad at LM, and any person, who sah free space in their ship accepts it and delivers.


[09-Jul-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	has*


[09-Jul-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	any person with PRO/Basic ofc.


[09-Jul-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it's not a great system, though.  it's hard to connect people who need things shipped with people who have space to ship


[09-Jul-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ASimpleToaster**:	Yeah, unfortunately it's kind of just asking in chat if someone has space/has something they want shipped and hoping someone sees along with posting a contract and picking them up


[09-Jul-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ASimpleToaster**:	Always a good idea to have a quick look when you're about to ship out and have room though


[09-Jul-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CheeryMan**:	Well, I usually think for myself: if I don't like some issues not connected with devs - I can either solve it or deal with it.

[10-Jul-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but unless i'm an ancient company with a lot of bases, i don't feel like i can do much to impact the broader universe.  i can tell a small amount of commodities to my local market, but not much else


[17-Jul-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jul-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	likewise.. but never have enough mats for the L, R and A fabs!


[17-Jul-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jul-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Shadowz121**:	Are there any good guides on ship building/upgrades out therE?


[24-Jul-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	what ships upgrades do u have in mind? u only have 1 base so u probably dont need to think about upgrading ur fleet any time soon


[24-Jul-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I am looking to build out another base, and I don't think I can support two bases with just my 2 starter ships


[24-Jul-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	what does ur current distrubtion network look like?


[24-Jul-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	are u importing iron or lst?


[24-Jul-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	if ur importing heavy goods u could look at a high load bay


[24-Jul-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	literally only beneton station, I need two products for my production from Beneton, and all the basic and luxury consumables from them.


[24-Jul-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I fill one ship with hydrogen every trip, need the second for the consumables and my other product


[24-Jul-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I looked into gathering Hydogrem here, but it didn't make sense with all the consumables that would be used vs how cheap it is


[24-Jul-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	whats the ratio of volume to ton that ur importing


[24-Jul-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	One ship full of Hydrogen is 500 m^3 of volume and only 35T of mass


[24-Jul-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	The consumables are more 1:1 or slightly more on mass


[24-Jul-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	i would probably look into buying a WCB/VCB/LCB for 1 or both of ur ships with probably a storage upgrade for ur base if u havent got that. Its pretty expensive to buy them right of the market so its best to try to source them from a player but they often have wait times so u might end up paying more by going through them since u may need to pay others to fufill ur shipping


[24-Jul-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I am totally lost on the shipbuilding part what is WCB/VCB/LCB ?


[24-Jul-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	BLU lets u see ur blueprints and see what a ship/ship upgrade would cost


[24-Jul-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	WCB/VCB/LCB are cargo bay upgrades if u go to ship kits on the benten CX u can see how much they cost, they are upgrades that increase ur cargo capacity


[24-Jul-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	VCB for example is the volume focused upgrade that has 1k ton/3k volume carrying capacity


[24-Jul-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Ok so basically I want one ship with a high volume?  or is that overkill and I should go to medium for now maybe?


[24-Jul-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	do u have a prunner save of ur base?


[24-Jul-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	is that prun planner?


[24-Jul-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	yah


[24-Jul-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Yes I use prun planner


[24-Jul-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sn3k**:	can i see ur base, im intersted in seeing what ur using


[24-Jul-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Sure, how do I share that?


[24-Jul-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Aye, understandable. The learning curve is pretty steep.


[03-Aug-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Still, there's a help button in the upper right of the screen. It should allow you to pick up where you left off.

**cod219**:	ah ok


[03-Aug-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Do you remember what your starting package was? Given that you're on this particular planet, my guess would be construction or metallurgy.

[05-Aug-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	unfortunately you'll have to wait.   it sounds like you queued up a very large order


[05-Aug-24 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you just started it, it may be worth cancelling it and resubmitting a smaller queue size?  i honestly know how much much input materials you'll get back, though


[05-Aug-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	It's also possible if you just started you won't have the workers until the next POPR so queue times are severly long. You could also be missing the basic consumables? (DW, RAT, OVE)


[05-Aug-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Next POPR comes out in a little over a day. 1d 5ish hours

**Stbadreturns**:	Total side note is there anyway we can get a warehouse expansion or 2?


[12-Aug-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erunamo**:	There is a warehouse on planet.  You can rent space there for 100 cis/unit/week.  I assume that works like the CX warehouses but I haven't tried it.  You can also build a storage facility in your base


[12-Aug-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes but Stbadreturns is asking for an upgraded warehouse, so we can rent more than 4 units


[12-Aug-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erunamo**:	Ah.  How does that work?  It looks like anyone can donate materials.  Once materials are donated does the governor have to build it or is it automatic?


[12-Aug-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	anyone can donate materials


[12-Aug-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the upgrade is automatic once the necessary materials are contributed


[12-Aug-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this should be pretty doable, the expansion requirements aren't crazy.  but i'm not sure how many levels of upgrades we'll need


[12-Aug-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ah, we need 2 more levels (to level 9) to get us to 5 rentable units, an 4 more levels (to level 11) to get up to 6 rentable units

**Stbadreturns**:	hey @wickskiracer is there any budget to support a few warehouse upgrades?


[14-Aug-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	I'd love to see most of the WH on planets that KAWA governs reach 7, 9, or 11 depending on the usual exports of those planets. Gibson is at 7 since most people are exporting fabs in an LCB ship, so 4 units would allow someone to buy a full ship on the LM. How big did you want it to get?


[14-Aug-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	(nurmally I'd just say 'hell yeah' and do it because I'm a storage addict myself... but we're trying to save up some money on all planets to prepare for the gateway update. I don't imagine it will be cheap, and it's the governments job to start the projects)


[14-Aug-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i bet some of us construction peoples here on gibson can make a sizable dent on the construction materials.  i'll see what i can do myself over the next few weeks, now that i'm no longer basebuilding


[14-Aug-24 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	i would like to see us get to 11 but even 9 would allow a 3k storage across the board

As a result of this deficit I will also have to increase taxes soon. This will hopefully leave room in the budget in the future to upgrade the warehouse.

[19-Aug-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	*sometimes 4:1


[19-Aug-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Out of curiosity... Are you EXT FE from Gibson already? Or do you plan to move the EXT completely?


[19-Aug-24 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I am make 1000s of  PE daily and I was looking for my first new base to do something with all of the PE


[19-Aug-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	When I first started PE was one of the first things I made. I turned it into BDE and OVE


[19-Aug-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	But I was on Umbra where MG and H were easy to comeby for PG


[19-Aug-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I sometimes make OVE, but only for my own use..i haven't been selling it..i will look at BDE


[19-Aug-24 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	yes, my idea was to bring FE to Gibson and make BDE, BTA


[19-Aug-24 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Could look into PP1's for a Gibson + Brokkraf combo. You will spend a ton of time shipping FE in but it gives you the opportunity to use the FE later on things like GL, RG, etc


[19-Aug-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	do you think I should take the PE to Brokkraf and make it there..or vice versa? maybe easier to move the PE?


[19-Aug-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Gibson has a construction CoGC which gives you a 25% efficiency boost to BDE, BTA, etc


[19-Aug-24 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	oh yeah :)


[19-Aug-24 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Brokkraf is mainly metallurgy to help smelt.


[19-Aug-24 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	yeah


[19-Aug-24 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I assume both of your ships are default 500/500?


[19-Aug-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	yes, correct


[19-Aug-24 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If you do go that route I'd look into upgrading one of your ships to a WCB (3000t/1000m) ASAP. Only 63 FE will fit in a 500/500 vs 381 in a WCB


[19-Aug-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	So maybe continue EXT/SME on Gibson until you have an upgrade? I'm not entirely sure who's still around making them besides myself but I'm backlogged for weeks


[19-Aug-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	*months


[19-Aug-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	You can usually find one for <= 500k give or take


[19-Aug-24 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	ok, good advice, it will only take a few days to save up for one...


[19-Aug-24 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	ok, maybe a week


[19-Aug-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	i think i will establish a base and get mining, and then save for a new ship


[19-Aug-24 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Bfabs are decent money starting out. It’s how I made a living for months


[19-Aug-24 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	yeah, i'm just now making enough money where I can look towards diversifying my production a bit....


[19-Aug-24 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	to build a ship, i need to contribute materials towards a shipyard project? then supply a blueprint?


[19-Aug-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	You can go anywhere that already has a shipyard with the mats that are specified in the blueprint using "BLU" in a new buffer. That might be a better question asked how to do so in the UFO discord


[19-Aug-24 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	That's way to much to type out in here and I don't know how to share screenshots


[19-Aug-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	ok, ty


[19-Aug-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Are you already in that discord or do you need a link?

**Snaevarr**:	Plan your next move, trade on the CX or between CXes, to name a few...


[22-Aug-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you are so inclined, you could also consider getting one of the loans aimed at new players. Would help you get set up, but not everyone likes doing things that way.


[22-Aug-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cheeki_Breeki**:	where does one acquire these loans


[22-Aug-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	People like Saganaki offer them on the discord, or you could try reaching out to him directly.


[22-Aug-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Might be others as well, if you ask in global.


[22-Aug-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cheeki_Breeki**:	ok probaly wont tbh dont want to be anable to pay them back later and im sure ill be fine


[22-Aug-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Can't blame you. Never used loans myself either. Even without loans you can expand pretty quickly, if you know what you're doing.


[22-Aug-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	a lot of the loan programs for newer players define "new players" as "accounts less than 60 days old"


[22-Aug-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so don't feel rushed into anything.   if, in a month, you think a loan would help you, you still will be able to reach out to people


[22-Aug-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ASimpleToaster**:	Other thing to note too is this game is "slow" in the sense that it's all real time. But besides the few things stated above you can do, checking on the CX and markets is a good thing to do when you have downtime. Keeping track of trends in goods prices and how often they're bought and sold is pretty important for planning where you want to focus your production in.

**Stbadreturns**:	I'm back again to ask the government to help us finish the warehouse upgrades a few people have donated and we are almost done this level  and I know we would need another level to get more warehouse space for everyone I have contributed to this level and will also contribute to the next level.


[27-Aug-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**wickskiracer**:	I will look into getting whatever resources remain to upgrade the warehouse.

**Lord_Genome**:	I got a question


[30-Aug-24 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	I fulfilled the tutorial contract and it was supposed to give me water.


[30-Aug-24 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	But where do I find it, I am at gibson.


[30-Aug-24 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Did you fulfill the pickup portion of the water? they don't just instantly give you the reward items


[30-Aug-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	I was in orbit of the planet and was able to fulfill it. I am based on gibson.


[30-Aug-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	do you have a base built?


[30-Aug-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	Yes but I don't see the water in the inventory.


[30-Aug-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	Unless there is another area in it?


[30-Aug-24 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	the only other place it could be is a warehouse or your ship inventory if the base is full


[30-Aug-24 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	How to refuel ship?


[30-Aug-24 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	You can click on "fuel" in your fleet screen. Then it's simply a matter of clicking and dragging fuel from your storage to your fuel tanks.


[30-Aug-24 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	Okay, thank you.


[30-Aug-24 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	When you demolish a building, is there anything recovered?


[30-Aug-24 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Usually, yes. Depending on how much time has passed since construction, you might get everything back (under 1 hour) or nothing (several months).


[30-Aug-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Points of time in between would yield only partial refunds.

**HesitantNinja**:	@Gravy thank you for that


[30-Aug-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	@Lord_Genome but you need to extract it elsewhere, the yield is just too low on Gibson


[30-Aug-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	I guess it is a long term plan then.


[30-Aug-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	best planet close to Benten is probably CB-282d, just outside red space, but has a nice concentration

[30-Aug-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	then again, JS-952f here in Ebisu is convenient, and not a *bad* concentration


[30-Aug-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	I'll keep those in mind. When I have a little more money.


[30-Aug-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Someone took it all and relisted some higher.  I've listed another 3k, hopefully some other producers can list some as well soon


[30-Aug-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	every single one I noted is a gaseous and at least 1 red bar, so extra costs to making bases there


[30-Aug-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I'm on both CB-282d and Ebisu F, CB-282d is definitely a bigger producer, but hauling Ebisu F is the win


[30-Aug-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Ebisu f can also make He which is also pretty useful for a lot of things, but I dunno how the supply is


[30-Aug-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	But not HE3 (Orm I believe is the closest) which you will need to make FF fuel


[30-Aug-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Hortus and Moria both have a glut of H, with Hortus having a good price for arbitage or at least not at a loss


[30-Aug-24 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	I think He is mostly good for welding stuff


[30-Aug-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	considering my plans, I might see about expanding to f here


[30-Aug-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lord_Genome**:	What qualifies as a starter base?


[03-Sep-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	When you first start the game, you typically are given enough resources to run 2 manufacturing facilities, and the habs for it.  As a new player thats a starter base.


[03-Sep-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	When you are creating new bases on other planets, usually people try to maximize the profit of the 500 space available and fill it.


[03-Sep-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Some planets/buildings are more expensive so sometimes its worth it just to start with something smaller that you can afford

[04-Sep-24 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	The loans being offered to new players are not exactly huge, but they tend to be 0% interest. If you're an established player, it kinda depends on how many bases you already have (and by extension your ability to repay).

[05-Sep-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	lol. yeah the upkeep materials are contributed by companies, usually the governor, then they have to pass a motion to get reimbursement for those materials. it gets real expensive


[05-Sep-24 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Odysseus6**:	So if I donate upkeep materials, will I get paid for them?


[05-Sep-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	generally no, unless it is a large donation or one requested by the governor. I'm sure if you reached out you could get reimbursement, but the price will be the ones KAWA uses to keep taxes low and you'd make less than selling on CX. I can send you reimbursement if you'd like, but yeah, largely for simplicity, the governor usually just tracks their own contributions, which is already a lot of work


[05-Sep-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Odysseus6**:	Gotcha, I'm still new so I was more curious on how it works. I don't have any spare materials right now lol


[05-Sep-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah I wish it were easier to ask for contributions and reimburse fairly, but right now it's all manual work in spreadsheets to track governing stuff so that gets really complicated. there was talk of an upkeep market being added some day though and that would make it so much better

[05-Sep-24 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	Oh, just iron ore. I would try for iron but it is not worth going anywhere for the mats for smelting it down.


[05-Sep-24 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	So I am just waiting for more ore to be mined or until I spot an opportunity somewhere.


[05-Sep-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Iron ore here is renatively expensive to mine, buying the carbon oxygen and flux to smelt it is *much* more lucrative to sell refined iron than the ore


[05-Sep-24 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	but for Gibson specificly, you get the most bonus if you're using prefab plants to make stuff, selling iron is best as a kickstart industry

**Lord_Genome**:	I will give it a try, converting to smelting now.


[05-Sep-24 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	We were suggesting making some pre-fab buildings (pp1), that is efficient on Gibson.  Then run those for awhile while also gathering your iron.  Eventually change from Iron to more pp1 or pp2 for example.  Smelting is just another item that doesn't take advantage of Gibsons bonus


[05-Sep-24 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	heh heh, well things are dismantled. I wish I saw that message sooner

[05-Sep-24 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-24 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	It can show you the actual profits of making different items.  You just need to get your CX setup to use Benton pricing.


[06-Sep-24 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	I will set one up at a later date when I expand into something else. Mental math was already done for this venture.


[06-Sep-24 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I would question your method for calculating Lord_Genome.  A smelter on Gibson smelting Iron makes 337.81 credits a day, and I don't think that even takes the planet manufacturing tax into account.  It definitely doesn't factor in shipping.


[06-Sep-24 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	An extractor on Gibson makes about 190.46 a day (same caveats as above).


[06-Sep-24 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	So if you had 1 extractor and one smelter running on gibson, you would be losing 208.95 a day after supplying your colonists with basic consumables.


[06-Sep-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Essentially running Iron on gibson is a money losing operation.


[06-Sep-24 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Now if you plopped down two HB1s and to PP1s to start, and made BSE, bought the inputs from Benton, you would make around 4635 a day.  Add in COF and PWO (luxury consumables) and you would make about 5676 a day.


[06-Sep-24 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	Kinda of takes away from the fun of the game, not doing what you want unless the calculator agrees.


[06-Sep-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Well theres fun discovering things, but straight up losing money in this game is not fun, if you do it too much right when you start you are destined for liquidation


[06-Sep-24 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	I have already experienced liquidation, still having fun. Heck I am probably losing money now. But then again I don't mind learning from my mistakes, and enjoy the learning process.


[06-Sep-24 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	If thats your style thats great.  When I saw him complaining about fuel costs, it clued me in that he must be either losing, or making very little with his setup


[06-Sep-24 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	It reads like the second player without a controller, who wants you to play the way they do.


[06-Sep-24 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	If thats the way you want to read it go for it.  Its advise to tools, and a small sample of mistakes that were made in his mental math.  You can provide your advice, which is play how you want, losing can be fun, and I can provide my advice with calculators.  Isn't it great that we can all provide our opinions/advice?


[06-Sep-24 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

If they don't like my advice they are free to either ignore me, or let me know they are not interested in my thoughts.  Just like you are able to ignore me, but for some reason is greatly offended that I let someone know they were miscalculating, which is an important part of the game.  When I first started I wished someone would have pointed out the costs of consumables to me, instead I had setbacks because of it.

[06-Sep-24 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	Oh I was complaining about the fuel costs because I saw how the price of hydrogen was not improving and seemed to only increase since I started.


[06-Sep-24 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	And simply flying to another place to buy was counter intuitive to the fuel cost ratio.


[06-Sep-24 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Yes hydrogen spiked recently.  I think if you have the ship with the 3k volume cargo hold shipping from another CX works out much cheaper.  But thats not factoring in anything for the time spent traveling there and back


[06-Sep-24 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	I have the starter ship so I can't ship much.


[06-Sep-24 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	And by the time I can, someone gets there first and ships a larger volume. So no go for a little guy like me.


[06-Sep-24 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Same.  I upgraded one of my starter ships to the 3k weight 1k volume, but its not ideal for Hydrogen.  Its what I have though.  Ships are expensive in this game


[06-Sep-24 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	Just last week I upgraded my ship, until then I have been running with my two starter ships


[06-Sep-24 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	FYI this is my first base on Gibson.  I don't make anything using the contruction bonus which it provides.  I didn't unnderstand that part of the game when I started.  I now build the rest of my bases to take advantage of the planets COGC program


[06-Sep-24 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	Yes but this is my first base. I do not know about the bonuses are downsides, but it can be learned later after some trail and error.

**Lord_Genome**:	Oops, accidently requested termination on contract. Is my stuff gone soon?


[10-Sep-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Genome**:	Or is it just a refund.


[10-Sep-24 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	there is no refund


[10-Sep-24 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	is the contract with another rplayer, or with a faction?


[10-Sep-24 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i think you can still fulfill your own deliveries.  so if the contract is with another player, i would message them right away and say that you made a mistake and ask them to *not* accept the termination


[10-Sep-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and just to be extra clear, there is no refund, so people sometimes use terminate to "gift" money to people. if person A wants to send money to person B, they open a buy contract for 1 unit of something at a price that matches how much money they want to send.   once the contract is accepted, person A delivers the money and then immeditally requests termination so that the other party doesn't actually have to deliver the 1 unit of whatever

**wickskiracer**:	Hi all. With the approach of Gateways coming quickly I wanted to hear your opinion on what actions we should take taxes wise in order to fund the Gateway coming out in a future update. We are still about 2,000,000 in deficit since I have taken office so there is that to cover. I wanted to hear your opinions on raising taxes by 5 for Pioneers (15CIS –> 20CIS it is a negligible change that shouldn’t affect much) to bring up the overall gov income. This will help eliminate the deficit and hopefully help build up a buffer to use for when Gateways release.  I wanted to bring this to your attention to get your opinion now. This action is not needed right away although could be required in the future depending on Gateway expenses. I wanted to hear your thoughts since your opinions matter to me. Let me know your thoughts either here or on discord!

**eminence32**:	i would focus on balancing the budget to correct the deficit, but not necessarily plan to fund a gateway entirely through taxes.   but having positive cashflow is always good, since it lets the coffers slowly fill

[10-Sep-24 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Sep-24 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Sol1point1**:	He's gonna tell you, that you are playing wwrong, that you sould be constructiong rather than what you'd like to do.


[10-Sep-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	hmh, I get that, currently contemplating investment in an incinerator.


[10-Sep-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	so I guess your comment suggests invest in farm first? havent figured out whether that will work on gibson yet


[10-Sep-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	I am aiming for an incinerator soon myself.


[10-Sep-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	Personally I think you should play how you like, it's how players stay for longer. But with the CoGC has been voted by players to be construction focused, so if you have production lines on this planet they will get a 25% increase in efficiency, so farms, incinerators and everything else are less profitable.


[10-Sep-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	Just that though, so have fun and play how you like.


[10-Sep-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	previous question, while playing without paid license, does CoGC affect  me?


[10-Sep-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	loving this "game"


[10-Sep-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	yes, it will.


[10-Sep-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	ahh, thanks


[10-Sep-24 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	Too many people forget it is still a game at the end of the day.


[10-Sep-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	The CoGC (Chamber of Global Commerce) applies a bonus of 25% to any building that matches it. In the case of Gibson, that would be construction. You don't need to do anything for it to be active - it gets applied automatically.


[10-Sep-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	you mean, bankrruptcy might not kill me???


[10-Sep-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	no xD


[10-Sep-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Contrary to Sol1point1's assumption, I don't think you should sacrifice fun for efficiency. There can be good reasons to deviate, and I do so myself as well. Just saying that, in general, it's more profitable.


[10-Sep-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	how would I see that bonus, eg on my Prefab Plant MK1?


[10-Sep-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	Right, so no fun then... Dunno long long I'll play then.


[10-Sep-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Should be under efficiency factors when you check new orders.


[10-Sep-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Sep-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Sep-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	Without paying you can't use the local market.


[10-Sep-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	yes, I may be edging toward that point.


[10-Sep-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Sep-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	There is a way to look up what listings people have on the CX, if you're interested.


[10-Sep-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, it's true that it's more efficient to do other things on gibson than to make carbon (and it's more profitable to make carbon elsewhere).  but if you really want to make carbon on gibson, don't let anyone tell you that you can't :)


[10-Sep-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	^ he's right


[10-Sep-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	making carbon is a means to an end, cheaper smelting, which I need - maybe i need - to build my resources to enable shift to construction focus


[10-Sep-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	but I am getting what you are saying, and its all ... fun


[10-Sep-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**waunder**:	how to look up listings on the local market? I think I'm fairly clear on the cx


[10-Sep-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ivo.B**:	is it worth it to get a Mineral resource extractor at JS-952c ?


[15-Sep-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	in my opinion:  yes extracting FEO and smelting it here can be a good idea for new players.  eventually you'll want to find a better ore extraction and smelting planet, but given how heavy this stuff it to move, you'll want some ship upgrades before doing that


[15-Sep-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ivo.B**:	ohh awesome, good to know, thanks ! i thought the "efficiency" in this planes was too low for it to be worth it, but since i dont know how it usually is, i cant compare


[15-Sep-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it's not worth it compared to a hypothetical future base dedicated to mining/smelting iron.


[15-Sep-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but compared to flying in FE to keep a PP1 fed?  i think it's worth it

**HesitantNinja**:	Gents, my first base here on Gibson is a farming and carbon burning operation, and well, now it's a BFab making outpost as well.  Should I start planning to move my farming and burning off of Gibson to a more suitable planet and just keep my Bfab operation here on Gibson?


[16-Sep-24 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Broadly speaking it's advisable to go with specialised bases over generalised ones. As for what that second base should do, that's entirely up to you. Inputs costing an arm and a leg? FE / AL / LST base would seem logical. Buying RATs for your workers hurting your bottom line? Get a base for that going. :p


[16-Sep-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I did establish a second base (on Brokkraf) for iron mining and smelting about a month ago. I have 4 smelters running there and am continuing to expand. But I am looking towards a third base I guess. I was wondering about the cost prohibitiveness of tearing down  9 BMPs and  11 farms here on Gibson to build them elsewhere.


[16-Sep-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	Prox is close and has space if you want to farm


[16-Sep-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Since early HQ upgrades are pretty cheap, you'll be able to expand to a 4th and 5th base pretty quickly. Without knowing anything about your setups, you could put your BMPs on a manufacturing planet and FRMs on an agri planet. Plenty of the latter around. Prox has already been mentioned, but is far from the only choice. Nemesis is another nearby one, and (slightly further out) Poseidon as well.


[16-Sep-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I forgot to mention, my 9 BMPs here on Gibson mostly crank out PolyEthylene. Does that production benefit from Gibson's Manufacturing boost? And then, would I just move my Farms and Incinerators to a planet like Prox or Nemesis?


[16-Sep-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	My second base on Broffrak making Iron has been a really serious boost to my income.. I plan to expand that base to the max.


[16-Sep-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I should clarify that I am turning all of that iron into Bfabs before using it or selling it. Quit a nice thing to make your own expansion materials.


[16-Sep-24 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Gibson's CoGC provides a boost to construction, not to manufacturing. Your faction bonus (for having your HQ in CI space) *is* for manufacturing, and applies to all your bases.


[16-Sep-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I wouldn't put your INCs on a farming planet, if I were you. Carbon is pretty heavy, so better to have it made where it gets used. With more logistical capacity you could consider an INC base on a planet with resource extraction CoGC.


[16-Sep-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Stbadreturns**:	Just be careful taco is currently lacking in pop lol ( laughs as I'm running a base at like 45% efficiency)  taco runs really lean as there isn't many of us on there.


[16-Sep-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	( not lacking in like a bad way it's just the pop is so low your reserves that you get per week typically don't fill a full base built at once )


[16-Sep-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Hmm just started the game. and the produce Carbon were u úse it tip IS nice. wen t for mining


[16-Sep-24 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	Thank you for these pro-tips gents. I would not have thought about the ---not hauling carbon--- approach.  Also, apparently I had the Manufacturing and Construction CoGCs combined in my head. I guess my near-term approach for now will be to establish a third base on an agricultural planet and just relocate my farms for the time being (and haul the plant materials).


[16-Sep-24 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	Interestingly, since my second base has ramped up, my two starter ships have gone from barely-used to now....the ships barely see hangar time and my pilots are regularly pulling double shifts.


[16-Sep-24 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	HOw many days did this take u IRL just out of curiosity


[16-Sep-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	It veries from person to person access to loans ect.


[16-Sep-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	@TheN00B I am entirely solo-self-found. I have been playing for 99 days. I started as a carbon farmer, and then made PE, and now I turn that all into the blue building materials, with the help of a second base smelting iron.


[16-Sep-24 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	but now my first base is getting crowded


[16-Sep-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I need to move some of this and get it organized elsewhere, especially since now I have witnessed first hand the CoGC boost for my prefab plants

[17-Sep-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGames_247**:	ok, how do i get there


[17-Sep-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mrcoffee09**:	the tutorial should help with some of that.  you may need to let your first few production orders finish


[17-Sep-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGames_247**:	so i watch some tutorials in the meantime, right?


[17-Sep-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	You take one of your ships, click on fly, and give Benten Station as the destination. Starting out, push the slider for the FTL reactor all the way left.


[17-Sep-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	The tutorials will answer a lot of your questions.

[17-Sep-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Starting out, things will be slow. Best advice I can give is to be patient, and try not to fly any faster than you have to, and fill the holds as much as you can.


[17-Sep-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-24 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGames_247**:	oh. thats just stupid


[17-Sep-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	You can put additional orders in the queue. Developers have bills to pay as well.


[17-Sep-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGames_247**:	i know. how much is PRO anyway?


[17-Sep-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	8 euros a month.


[17-Sep-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGames_247**:	for a south african, way to much for a simple(as in easy) game


[17-Sep-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	since i have pro, i just bought 1 unit at 138, which caused the price bands to be readjusted


[25-Sep-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Sep-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Same with the ore. almost no supply compared to demand. i can understand the prices


[25-Sep-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Offers are at 138-39. lowest value u can sell for is 38 and that is the stations sett value. i am reading this right


[25-Sep-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	sort of, but not quite


[25-Sep-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	at the moment, the lowest you can sell SIO for is 118 CIS, because that is at the top of the bid section of the order book


[25-Sep-24 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the only way to sell SIO for 38 (to the market maker) would be if the entire bottom of the order book got cleared out (which can happen, but not likely with this particular material)

**HesitantNinja**:	what did I do this time?


[26-Sep-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Resonably priced carbon


[26-Sep-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	lolz, yeah, that carbon sold out in a few hours


[26-Sep-24 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Carbon has been at scalpin prices for a while now i would say. And i need money fo bulkheads and other such things


[26-Sep-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	I got help from another. But still it is things like that, that make scalpers mad. and people like me happy xD


[26-Sep-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	I can only imagine what will happen when the poeple with cash start buying up the market instead of producing


[26-Sep-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	what is your chosen starting profession @THeN00B?


[26-Sep-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Mining


[26-Sep-24 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	And steal production


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	I regret choosing this planet now after understanding what planets are good


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	BUUUT


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	ahhh, ok...i have recently started an Iron mining operation myself on Brokkraf


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	What can i do. Don't wanna restart


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Seem like that would b better noticed ALU is really good to produce


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	High in demand


[26-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	low SUP


[26-Sep-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Annoying quantaties from smelting doe


[26-Sep-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	When i have the opertunity i am investing in Food and water PROD, and thene my own bulk and deck prefab components, they cost waaay to much


[26-Sep-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	For now xD


[26-Sep-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Might change that statement later when i start making cash


[26-Sep-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Can always hang out with us on Ementior. All the ALO and LST you could want. Green environmentals mean it's cheaper to settle than Giedi Prime too.


[26-Sep-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	you are in for, perhaps, a bit of a slow start trying to mine on Gibson.....but you can certainly farm on gibson

***MrMillennialFalcon** joined.*


[26-Sep-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**THeN00B**:	Hmm. so i should have gone farming here. Maybe i should liquidate my assets, and restart. BUt slow start works


[26-Sep-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	rather than restart, you could demolish your unwanted buildings and use the returned materials to start up some farms


[26-Sep-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	you get materials back when you demolish


[26-Sep-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	And then Prodigus (that's me) has to deliver 15k CIS

**SilentReaper**:	Hello Gibsonians. FIOC is currently looking for new members to join our ranks. We work differently than other corps as we operate based on a gift economy. This means we share all outputs internally. We do not interact with the CX at all. This allows us to plan projects as a team, work together on planets, and focus on expanding into new production chains or expanding existing ones in stead of just making money go up. If you feel this would mesh well with your own playstyle, check out our welcome page for more information. https://discord.gg/WNgrAzMdhx

[18-Oct-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	that said, the general trend over the past half a year is upward, so i'd love to see more carbon producers to try to give the price down a bit


[18-Oct-24 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Maybe not if carbon just briefly goes up, but if it stays consistently above 800, I'd recommend having a look at Arclight CX as well. Even though it's further away, it might be worth it.

**iagoDoc**:	@Locyar, that's exactly the point of this game... that the price of the goods is set by the market. I mean, you're selling cheaper than other people. Iron price has been growing since sept, 22nd or so... other resources increase / decrease in value aswell. Let's say you can buy A LOT of resources and you happen to realise the price of a couple of them is extremely cheap for what it normally is... if you buy in bulk and produce whatever derivate from them you could offer the same product at a cheaper prices than those who spent more on the raw materials...


[21-Oct-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**iagoDoc**:	also... let's say you make a mistake and spend all your cashflow... If you want to get back on track you'll need instant cash... wich if you're alone can only come from selling at a lower price than normal. That's another posibility, for example

[23-Oct-24 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Depends a bit on what you built, but some things can indeed take a long time. Plenty of things to do in the meantime though; planning next steps, sending a ship to the Benten CX to get more consumables and input materials, etc.


[23-Oct-24 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	Hmm...okay thanks


[23-Oct-24 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	for the orders i have queued, does it pull the required resources when i queue or will it pull when it starts?


[23-Oct-24 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Only when it starts, and only from your base inventory. Warehouse inventory and ship inventory aren't touched (useful, if you want to keep some materials seperate).


[23-Oct-24 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	Okay thanks, i think I figured out my start. i sent a ship to benten to sell off my spare iron ore but kept enough to make my first queued smelter order kick off since it begins before my currently running extractor order finishes


[23-Oct-24 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	do non-essentials give a production boost or something?


[23-Oct-24 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Nice. I'm not saying you picked anything wrong, but this planet is a construction planet. Eventually, you might want to turn that iron ore into iron and then into prefabs. Metals and ores are heavy, so they don't scale well.


[23-Oct-24 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Yup, luxury consumables increase efficiency and thus reduce the time it takes to make something.


[23-Oct-24 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	yeah i will, i just figured since everything takes so long i might as well sell off my spare ore


[23-Oct-24 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Fair point. As your buildings work, you will slowly start to get experts as well. Activating them well reduce production times further.


[23-Oct-24 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	*will


[23-Oct-24 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	With 5 experts and all pioneer consumables, an extractor should work about 2x as fast.


[23-Oct-24 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	okay, i can buy some boosts while my ship is at bentar tomorrow night, or whatever its called


[23-Oct-24 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Indeed. Be careful with your fuel usage sliders by the way. Common mistake new people make is to set the engines to full burn. By being sparing, you should be able to get from here to Benten and back several times before refueling.


[23-Oct-24 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Could even sell some fuel on the CX for some extra credits, if you want, but that's up to you. :p


[23-Oct-24 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	yeah i turned them all the way down. no reason to rush moving stuff that takes me forever to replace


[23-Oct-24 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Aye, you're not wrong there. Usually it's better to pick a usage that's slightly above minimum (because absolute minimum slows your ship to a crawl). Then, as you get more money, you can fly a bit faster to capitalise on opportunities.


[23-Oct-24 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	i'll keep that in mind fo rfuture trips. for now, everyone seems to be crawling haha


[23-Oct-24 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	so i can see on my next contract i will need to "pick up" 8 BSE at my base. now, knowing i don't have BSE i guess this is supposed to be prompting me to buy some from the exchange?

[23-Oct-24 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Most of your money will not come from contracts btw, but from selling your goods either at the LM (though that's a pro feature) or at the CX (where most things are traded).


[23-Oct-24 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	LM is like having my own shop?


[23-Oct-24 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	how much is prop anyway? i can see this is going to be required


[23-Oct-24 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If it's a contract you want to pursue, then you would have to provide 8 BSE somehow, yes. It might not be a profitable contract if you need to buy the materials, but you don't need to complete npc contracts that you don't like.


[23-Oct-24 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	ok thanks


[23-Oct-24 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	LM is the Local Market. As in, here on this planet. Saves you the hassle of sending a ship, but usually the goods on offer are very limited.


[23-Oct-24 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	As for the price, I think pro is 8 euro/dollar/whatever. After being pro for at least a month, your account will become basic (instead of free, which is what you are now). As basic, you're still able to accept LM listings and custom contracts, you just won't be able to make new ones yourself.

[25-Oct-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	the other issue is a totally jacked up my travel screen, and have no way to restore it. i can rebuild it by hand, but have to figure out that which was deleted to begin with, as i had not had enough time to use it to even know what all was in it


[25-Oct-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you want to do metallurgy, i don't think i would pick katoa, since it has no ores on planet (whereas you have iron ore here on gibson)


[25-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	oh yeah, i was thinking like long term strategy... katao would be right by the CXL, and again.... i just cant stand not being able to build somewhere, yet if i decide to grab it now i can hold it and build there later


[25-Oct-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	katoa is a great planet to be sure.  it's popular for fuel refining and manufacturing


[25-Oct-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	maybe metallurg at gibson, then fab at katao


[25-Oct-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	yeah


[25-Oct-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	im assuming i will move up into manufacturing, once i have the metal down


[25-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	and as my waystation i can refuel there etc


[25-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you keep this base at gibson, i'd recommend that you start with a little metallury but then then the iron into things like BBH


[25-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	i went into STL already


[25-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	oops typo:  but then turn the iron into things like BBH


[25-Oct-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	but yeah was still figuring out long term direction


[25-Oct-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	iron is very heavy.  avoid flying it around if possible (unless you've upgraded some ships)


[25-Oct-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	id basically be grabbing a spot at katao, then moving right back out to gibson to do ores with my second permit


[25-Oct-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	since you're already thinking about other bases in the benten area, you might find this doc useful:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/10qdF6wEpZshm-ErQmjyELfjcDpuXh4ZJjlB_1Wcibk4/pub

[26-Oct-24 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs.

[29-Oct-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Nov-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you didn't get a warehouse at Benten, the items will be held in your contracts screen until you have space for them. In either case you'll still have to send a ship to Benten to pick up your materials though.


[02-Nov-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NikitaSerpent**:	I just started.. making exoskeletons does not seem profitable. What should I be doing?


[02-Nov-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Exoskeletons are profitable, but it helps a lot if you're able to provide the input materials yourself. If you have to buy the aluminium and overalls from the open market, that'll eat into your profit margins.


[02-Nov-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NikitaSerpent**:	I just have two basic materials plants starting out. What would be a good a production line?


[02-Nov-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	As for what would be a more efficient option... This planet, Gibson, is specialised in construction. If you're able to get some FE/AL and LST, you could turn that into BSE or BBH in prefab plant.


[02-Nov-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	you are better off making/selling PTs and buying the EXOs.


[02-Nov-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NikitaSerpent**:	what are PTs?


[02-Nov-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	Power Tools


[02-Nov-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	PTs and EXOs are both built in a BMP


[02-Nov-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NikitaSerpent**:	And I get steel of a Commodity exchange?


[02-Nov-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	use the STL + TRN = EXO recipe


[02-Nov-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Plenty of good options in the BMP, but also some to avoid. PT, EXO, OVE, PE and MCG can all be done profitably. I'd stay away from things like STR, OFF, SUN if I were you.


[02-Nov-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	sorry, STL + TRN = PT


[02-Nov-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Nov-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	There is also none at Benton and would require going greater distances to supply.

[03-Nov-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	i am willing to do the legwork of transport in exchange for a good price..which is why I am looking for someone with a surplus piling up


[03-Nov-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I was hoping to buy one shipload, which would be 181 units..to make the trip worth it


[03-Nov-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-24 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	FE is more common. And AL is just a lot better all around. You can make BFabs faster in PP2s with AL. You need AL for LFabs, and a ton of other things. It's literally just supply and demand if you ask me.


[04-Nov-24 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	I still have some TRU on hand, 8 specifically, as well as some MCG (depends how much you need)


[04-Nov-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	yeah I have exactly 363 MCG available to sell, the rest I need for a building very soon


[04-Nov-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	I don't need any of the TRU, I just haven't bothered shipping to the CX to sell it


[04-Nov-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	uh so yeah feel free to post an LM ad or send me a contract (I can't set any myself)

[04-Nov-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Ya  just worried I can't get it here before the next pop report


[04-Nov-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	uhhh last one was 6 days ago and change, so yeah you'll be cutting it super close regardless


[04-Nov-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	so like... 22 hours?


[04-Nov-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	and poke @hesitantNinja to see how much MCG they're willing to sell ya


[04-Nov-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Ya I messed up my ships are on a long haul


[04-Nov-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	@FastProducer, i can bring in that much MCG in 12 hours, but i'll charge you a premium of 32 CIS per unit


[04-Nov-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Sure, that would be great!  Can you help with the Tru that Joanna can't provide?


[04-Nov-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	how much TRU do you need?


[04-Nov-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and how much MCG exactly?  i don't want to be short


[04-Nov-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	I need 87 tru (minus any Joana can help with) and 3288 MCG


[04-Nov-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	i have 8 TRU and 363 MCG


[04-Nov-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	I have 743 MCG at gibson if you want it


[04-Nov-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**The_Stinker**:	I can get that much mcg in 3 days if you want it


[04-Nov-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	oh cool, Yes I can grab that,If eminence doesn't mind reducing the order a bit?


[04-Nov-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	I think the need is 'now' xD


[04-Nov-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Ya I want to beat the pop report for building.


[04-Nov-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	toss me a contract or two, I'll sell at current market rate at Benten CX


[04-Nov-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	I actually have this stuff at Benton, but no way to get it here in time


[04-Nov-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**The_Stinker**:	sorry, then. juest sent my mcg out


[04-Nov-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	How much do you have?


[04-Nov-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	363 MCG (so we can make that an even 10k? slightly less than 28 per unit) and 8 TRU (3200, just call it a even 400 each)


[04-Nov-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	i like round numbers :3


[04-Nov-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-24 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	to be fair, I will be using the MCG i still needed on hand to start up more production tomorrow morning, I just need supplies from my other base first


[04-Nov-24 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	welding plant @_@


[04-Nov-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	funny, I am also building WPs on Gibson, moving my BMPs elsewhere. Do you need any bfabs Joanna? I have plenty of stock right here on planet.


[04-Nov-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	I make bfabs already xD


[04-Nov-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	excellent


[04-Nov-24 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	i run 5 pp1 at the moment, going to start with 2 welding plants, then maybe expand to 3 or 4 depending on how well I can get the products to move


[04-Nov-24 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	and how well I can keep them supplied


[04-Nov-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	imma tear down all my BMPs on Gibson and move them to Uponor...then replace with more PP1s and WPs


[04-Nov-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	ye, always helps when people work with each other like that


[04-Nov-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	yeah my #2 base is over on Geidi Prime for Iron and AL


[04-Nov-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Giedi... bleh, weird spelling


[04-Nov-24 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	@eminence yes, nice trading :)


[04-Nov-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Ninja, I just bought a bunch of bfabs this morning off the market


[04-Nov-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Wish I knew then :)


[04-Nov-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	the only bfab I don't regularly make is BTA because it's kinda not a great seller xD


[04-Nov-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	gibson, being a construction planet, has a whole bunch of people making bfabs


[04-Nov-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	but yeah i make like 20-25 a day at the moment... I could easily expand tho


[04-Nov-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	That makes sense


[04-Nov-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	if I had a better AL supply that didn't involve buying from the CX, i could add in PP2s and easily double my production


[04-Nov-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	*oh that might have been why I had TRU here*


[04-Nov-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	giedi is your best bet for AL, i think


[04-Nov-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	yeah, I just have it focus on FE for now because I use so much


[04-Nov-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but it requires HSE and INS to build


[04-Nov-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	probably should add another extractor to allow my smelters to not deplete my ore so fast


[04-Nov-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but you can make the HSE here on gibson if you have PP3s :)


[04-Nov-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and the INS too!


[04-Nov-24 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	fair, but that's higher tier than I have supplies for, so it's a little further along x3 just need to get supplies and such I guess


[04-Nov-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	honestly I plan on sidetracking into ship parts


[04-Nov-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	@FastProducer I will be happy to hook you up next time you need :)


[04-Nov-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	@Joanna I was also planning on making SSCs here on Gibson. I'd wager you had the same idea?


[04-Nov-24 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	that and some plating


[04-Nov-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	building stuff that every player needs is smart


[04-Nov-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	ah yeah HWP is technician tier, but metallurgy is better suited to Giedi I think


[04-Nov-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Exactly, though I'm probably not going to get into food production xD

**Snaevarr**:	Since AL got mentioned; Ementior is another option. Takes a little bit longer to get to than Giedi Prime, but has all green environmentals (so it's cheaper to build and maintain). Comes with LST as well, so potentially better for those looking to fuel PP1~2s.

[05-Nov-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	The issue is cost.


[05-Nov-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	When iron takes them dips into 500 for cost then they can make since to make but at least on ben people have been making enough of them to not hit my order so that good to see at least

[05-Nov-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Nov-24 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	want me to accept the LM ad now? I'll have the BTA produced and ready for delivery first thing in the morning, about uhhhh 12-13 hours from now?


[05-Nov-24 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Although we have a technician and engineer shortage now


[05-Nov-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Joanna_Hart**:	(I also have a stock of BDE, BSE and BBH on hand if you need any of that)


[05-Nov-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	Good to know. I'll probably send a couple contracts in a few days, once I finish burning through this haul.


[05-Nov-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Sounds good, I *always* make BSE and BDE, then balance out with BBH if I have more iron


[05-Nov-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	typically I ship to CX and sell for whatever market price or asking price is, but if you buy local I'm more than willing to drop the prices

**Lilholo**:	welp i set up my first "base" with 4 basic building, any recomendations for next steps ? since i dont think im gonna wait 16 hours till next step


[06-Nov-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	what profession did you choose?


[06-Nov-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lilholo**:	i didnt know you could pick diffrent one but im a miner/metallugist i think


[06-Nov-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	OK so you are mining iron ore on Gibson?


[06-Nov-24 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	@Lilholo just understand this game is very slow in the beginning and it's not a game even seasoned players spend hours on  i spent more time talking then I ever do actually working 😂


[06-Nov-24 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lilholo**:	yes im mining iron ore on bison and smelting it into iron and ye i get that, im familier with idle games but this is very slow compared to that lmao


[06-Nov-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HesitantNinja**:	It becomes less and less of an idle game the more you expand your empire until at some point it's not an idle game at all


[06-Nov-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	PRUN isn't really an idle game (at least i don't think of it as such).   it's more like an space-themed economy simulator


[06-Nov-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lilholo**:	So now that i have my first base what is my main starter goal ? molre bases on seprate tiles ? expanding my first base ?


[06-Nov-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lilholo**:	how do i hire more peole and get moroe building resourcces


[06-Nov-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, so the basic game loop is:  buy or mine materials.  turn those materials into more valuable things via your production lines.  sell the more valuable stuff to get more cash to buy more input materials

[06-Nov-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	longer term you can do things like build bases on other planets, or buy bigger/faster ships to move goods more quickly.  but at the very start the thing to focus on is expanding your base


[06-Nov-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	that might mean saving up enough money to buy the materials to build more smelters


[06-Nov-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	or that might mean building a "Prefab Plant MK1" building, which will let you turn that iron into building materials

**HesitantNinja**:	@Liholo the name of your nearest Commodity Exchange is called Benton station Commodity Exchange. That's where we all go to buy and sell goods. As soon as you have a reasonable amount of iron you can fly there and sell it on the market


[06-Nov-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lilholo**:	Alright thank you


[06-Nov-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	despite being a little slow, this game does have a lot of depth and complexity.  feel free to ask questions whenever you want, there's usually people hanging around to answer


[06-Nov-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lilholo**:	how do i hire more people/pioneers


[06-Nov-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you build Infrastructure buildings like HB1 (Pioneer Habitation)


[06-Nov-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you don't hire them directly.   based on the production buildings you build, you'll need a certain number of workers.  you just need to make sure you build enough homes from them


[06-Nov-24 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lilholo**:	👌👍


[06-Nov-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Nov-24 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blattlaus**:	I fixed the issue, the price is now at 740 :P


[07-Nov-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sol1point1**:	My guess is they are importing from elsewhere, I had a look through the leaderboards, and can't see any reason they'd be selling so much.

[07-Nov-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Nov-24 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Nov-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erunamo**:	Unless there is a population shortage on planet, having a job (building for them to work in) and housing should give them to you automatically and instantaneously


[13-Nov-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erunamo**:	If you look at POPR JS-952c (in a new buffer) it will show you there is unemployment for pioneers (so you should get them instantly) but there is a shortage of engineers (open jobs).  If you build something requiring engineers, you will not get any right now

**Gnaget**:	Am I making a mistake producing PE here?  Every campaign is for construction, should I be somewhere where production is incentivized?


[19-Nov-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erunamo**:	I don't know if making PE on Gibson is profitable or not.  However, it would be more profitable on a planet with a manufacturing bonus.  Have you heard of prunplanner?  It is an external tool that helps you easily look at different base designs


[19-Nov-24 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Though if you have a PP1 then the PE you are making will let you make BDE, which you can make profit from ;)


[19-Nov-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gnaget**:	I have been avoiding using prunplanner out of fear that it would take away the exploratory fun of this game.  I was thinking about creating a PP1, that might be my next move.  So far PE has been profitable just because I can pre-sell capacity on the LM for more than I could sell it at the CX.  I'm thinking all the construction focused people here increase the demand


[19-Nov-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erunamo**:	That definitely helps :)  Early on it is easy to manually calculate profit.  I did that.  As you get later on in the game, the extra tools help :)  You should look at BDE profit if you get a PP1 like Scorpium said

[06-Dec-24 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	The UI can be a bit finicky at first, but you'll get the hang of it soon enough. You can also get any buffer to display what you'd like by clicking the gear symbol in the upper right and inputting the appropriate command.


[06-Dec-24 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CodyProductions**:	Yeah is there a way to lock tiles? I don't wanna keep accidentally closing my tiles.


[06-Dec-24 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Might be easier to take an existing tile and split it horizontally or vertically.


[06-Dec-24 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you hover over the gear icon, you'll see two lines for just that purpose.


[06-Dec-24 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CodyProductions**:	I was able to fix the tiles I just want to ensure that I won't accidentally delete them again.

[06-Dec-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	cody i had that problem when i started, best fix was to just keep a copy of each screen


[06-Dec-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	so if you mess one up you can delete it, recopy the other copy, and have 2 again


[06-Dec-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akare**:	before too long you will be able to fix it by hand very quicjkly, and you will have your own custom screens for everything

**Thunderchief**:	i am a new metalurgist, is it recommended to built another extractor on another planet to acquire another mineral?


[27-Dec-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gnaget**:	It takes a ton of money to start a new base on a new planet.  You'll need to expand here or start over


[27-Dec-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thunderchief**:	as i build buildings that require settlers, they will automatically come to my base as long as i have habitat capacity?


[27-Dec-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, you generally want to build out your first base before starting a second one


[27-Dec-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Indeed. As long as you have both the workplaces and the room in your habitats, they will come.


[27-Dec-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	also moving metals and ores is quite hard to do in starter ships (the stuff is just so heavy, you can't move a lot in a starter ship), so if you're going metallurgy on gibson, my recommendation is to build up gibson as much as you can to rely on the fact that you don't need to move any FEO around


[27-Dec-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	at some point you'll out grow this one planet, but at that point you'll hopefully have the funds to upgrade a ship


[27-Dec-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thunderchief**:	good input. makes sense. tnx


[27-Dec-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	Sometimes you have to wait up to a week for workers to show up.  You automatically get 200 Pioneers with every new base.  All others have to come from un-employed workers on the planet.  If you click on the Workforce population in the planet window, you can get a rough idea of how many unemployed workers there are.


[27-Dec-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	In between reports you can only hire a few, but when a new report comes out, everyone waiting for workers gets some depending on how many are available.


[27-Dec-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FastProducer**:	For example Gibsons current report came out 2 days/22 hours ago, so if you built a massive base needing a bunch of workers you would probably have to wait 4 days 2 hours for the next report to get them all


[27-Dec-24 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thunderchief**:	Thanks for the additional info FP.

We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs.

**SilentReaper**:	Hello Gibsonians. FIOC is looking to bring on new members to join the group. We operate different than other corps in that we share everything internally. We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs. If you're interested in how we do things, come check out our welcome page for more information. https://discord.gg/WNgrAzMdhx

[06-Feb-25 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you'll be able to sell the outputs of your extractor or smelter on the commodity exchange, and then once you have enough cash saved up, you can buy additional building materials to expand your production lines

**isherwood**:	it's also very useful to rent space in the warehouse at the exchange (and often also on the planets). It's usually quite cheap and then you can buy/sell w/o having a ship at the CX or having your orders held back by contracts. Type WAR BEN in the buffer.

[03-Mar-25 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	KAWA governs a lot of planets in the Benten area and has taken care of Gibson for a while. TAfirehawk is the leader of our governing team that works together to make sure all those planets are taken care of and taxes are spent effeciently. TAfirehawk does a lot of work balancing tax math and making sure that everything is taken care of well on like 20 planets. They don't have permanent bases on all of those planets because that's a lot of permits, but they do keep a CM kit on all of them so that they can drop a temp base and fill CoGC every 10 days, which they have done on time for the last 5 cycles ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ If there's ever an questions about stuff you can just message him, but I don't think it's fair to the work he's done to claim he can't govern without a permanent base. I've seen the math he does and he's put a lot of work into mainainitng gibson for as cheap as possible


[03-Mar-25 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	If you look at the CoGC contributions this time they were made by other people on Gibson. Understandably they were getting concerned it hadn't been paid yet...


[03-Mar-25 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I did say my opinion would be unpopular - and I was apparently correct


[03-Mar-25 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	well yeah, the contributions only show the last things filled. He fills all planets on the same day, and for gibson that's today or tomorrow


[03-Mar-25 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	no you're good, I don't want it to sound like I'm trying to come after you specifically or anything, just trying to explain our system a bit for some context seemed fair


[03-Mar-25 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Not how we've been used to the CoGC being operated here...


[03-Mar-25 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	I mean, TA has filled the last 5 cycles sucessfully and KAWA has been managing Gibson for almost 8 months now


[03-Mar-25 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	we're very open to feedback, but I'm not really sure what is being asked


[03-Mar-25 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I was asked about the CoGC as I am a MoP


[03-Mar-25 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	well yeah, I was answeing the same question. You mention things operating different though and are clearly not pleased but I don't know what we could be doing better


[03-Mar-25 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	extremely low taxes, good workforce numbers on POPR, and never missed a CoGC upkeep. I know having a base here makes sense, but it's clearly not necessary to do the job.


[03-Mar-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I have no complaints about taxes etc, but clearly some people were concerned that the CoGC hadn't been paid yet.


[03-Mar-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	As usual I wish I'd kept my mouth shut...


[03-Mar-25 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	no, you're fine, I'm not trying to be mean. You seemed unhappy with governor and I wanted to understand what we should be doing differently. That's all. CoGC is under control, but if there's ever any concerns about it your welcome to ping me or TAfirehawk, we have plenty of materials ready

**Fedii**:	Hi, can I use this chat to make some questions, or is there another room for that?


[10-Mar-25 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Hey there. You can use this chat (planet chat for Gibson), global chat or help chat. The latter two will usually result in your questions getting answered sooner, but even here on Gibson there's usually someone able to help out.


[10-Mar-25 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fedii**:	@Snaevarr thank you, really appreciated. I'll try first with the help chat.


[10-Mar-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fedii**:	But it seems it can't load the chat. Is it normal?


[10-Mar-25 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you type COMC in a new buffer, you should see the Official APEX Help Channel listed as one of the options

**SilentReaper**:	Hello Gibsonians. FIOC is looking to bring on new members to join the group. We operate different than other corps in that we share everything internally. We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs. If you're interested in how we do things, come check out our welcome page for more information. https://discord.gg/WNgrAzMdhx

[19-Mar-25 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Mar-25 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Mar-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	should i be sending my ships to go buy things from commodity exchanges to get started, or is there a better way


[25-Mar-25 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	yes, you should


[25-Mar-25 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	if your cargo hold is not full and you have PRO, look at the LM of your departure and destination before a trip. some people might have put shipping ads and will pay you to ship their stuff


[25-Mar-25 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ok, dont have pro but there does not appear to be any shipping contracts available


[25-Mar-25 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	there are two


[25-Mar-25 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	ah nvm, someone just took them


[25-Mar-25 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	benten is the closest exchange correct? will prices vary wildly between the exchanges or is the closest one generally the best. I was planning to start producing stuff to build new building as i assume that is the most optimal idea... obviously could be wrong, is there a specific building I should build if i started as a construction start


[25-Mar-25 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	there are small differences between the exchanges, but not big enough that you need to look at other changes.  you can focus just on benten


[25-Mar-25 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i also build construction materials here on gibson to support my expanding my bases


[25-Mar-25 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	Correct, Benten is closest (1 hop). Moria is second closest (6 hops or something), then Antares (about 8)


[25-Mar-25 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	as you are Constructor, then your first buildings should be PP1.


[25-Mar-25 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you can also build an EXT to get you iron ore and a SME to turn it into iron that you can use in your PP1


[25-Mar-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Arclight is also 8 jumps away (same as Antares), but better to ignore that one for those starting out.


[25-Mar-25 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	does Arclight even have daily trades?


[25-Mar-25 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Sure does, and like Benten the currency used is CIS.


[25-Mar-25 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Supply is unreliable though, and orders take longer to fill - hence why new players should probably give it a pass.


[25-Mar-25 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	"unreliable" is an understatement


[25-Mar-25 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	in the past 30 days, there's been a about 10k units of RAT traded at arclight.


[25-Mar-25 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	more than that has traded at benten in the past 24 hours


[25-Mar-25 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ok, I was about to send my ship to benten and double checked shipping contracts, and there is one there, but I cant take it as it is A rating, how do I improve my rating, and what is the benefit of making contracts require a ratring


[25-Mar-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**wickskiracer**:	to receive a rating you must have a pro license and complete a handful of contracts


[25-Mar-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ah, ok


[25-Mar-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**wickskiracer**:	is is very easy to keep a A rating as long as both parties complete contracts


[25-Mar-25 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	well, gonna go study, is there stuff I should do in before I go (do I need to buy food, or set new production queues, I have 1BSE and 2BBH going


[25-Mar-25 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	your production lines are powered by workers.  there are different worker types for different building types.  a PP1 building requires "pioneers"


[25-Mar-25 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	make sure you have all the "essential" consumables for pioneers, which is: Drinking Water + Basic Rations + Basic Overalls


[25-Mar-25 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ok, I wont be gone long, just wanted to make sure I didnt screw the pooch before I even started


[25-Mar-25 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	just did some math, could be wrong or missing something substantial, is it really going to take me 90.66 hours to produce all the materials I need just for an extractor.


[25-Mar-25 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	should I be buying construction materials?


[25-Mar-25 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	this game runs at a pretty slow pace


[25-Mar-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for example, i'm currently waiting about 30 hours for a ship to fly home


[25-Mar-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	some parts will speed up when you can afford to buy multiple production lines (so multiple PP1 buildings), but there's always waiting in this game :)


[25-Mar-25 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	so then should I buy the materials I want for my extractor and smelter I want to produce Iron? or will that run over my 50k liquid assets CIS


[25-Mar-25 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	things will also speed up a bit if you produce luxury consumables for your workers, and also when you get experts (which slowly show up over time and will give up a small boost in production speed, up to 28% max)


[25-Mar-25 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	what buildings have you built so far?  just a PP1?


[25-Mar-25 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	PP1 and BMP


[25-Mar-25 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	I saw it produced MCG which alot of buildings used so built that


[25-Mar-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	BMPs are pretty useful to have.  they can also make things like OVE for you (an essential consumable for your workers)


[25-Mar-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so i have to admit, i've kind of forgotten what brand new players cash flow is like, so here's some general advice:


[25-Mar-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	always make sure you have enough cash to be able to keep your workers supplied with consumables and input materials


[25-Mar-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	will I also need to build another HB1 to house the people I need for the EXT and SME


[25-Mar-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	nvm, answered own question, found the workers needed stat


[25-Mar-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you're making BSE in order to build a EXT building, then that's great.  but you *might* have to sell some BSE to get cash to buy DW+RAT+OVE


[25-Mar-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i don't think you will need to do that, but that's the type of thing you should keep an eye on


[25-Mar-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ok, so I dont want to run down all my liquid assets


[25-Mar-25 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah.   and also you have to pay a small tax/fee everytime you make something.  normally this is so small you don't ever have to care about this.  but if you let your bank balance get  down to zero, you won't be able to make anything because you can pay the production fee


[25-Mar-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	I noticed that yeah, Ive sepnt like, 100 odd CIS on production I think, very small, but I can see how itd mess you up


[25-Mar-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	is there a website/ spreadsheet with average prices for materials?


[25-Mar-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	oh gosh yes


[25-Mar-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	hallelujah

[25-Mar-25 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Mar-25 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	https://doc.fnar.net/


[25-Mar-25 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	just threw the buildings into the calculator, for me to buy everything it would come out to ~~60k


[25-Mar-25 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Egamadeus**:	So I just started a month ago, so take what i saw with a grain of salt, but when I was just started out I discovered I needed to find something I could do to make a steady stream of money to keep my workers happy and then slowly expand my base...for me because I was a metallurgist I made/sold Iron...for you with a BMP that may sit idle, you could concentrate on something like PE, or OVE...buying the raw materials at the CX bring it back, make it and then ship it back...with PE you can buy a Carbon for 731, 2 hydrogen for 200, and make 200 PE and sell it for 8.74 a piece at the CX for 1748, which gives you a nice 900 CIS per production run...you can get your shipping mostly paid for with the Shipping Contracts from the Government


[25-Mar-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Egamadeus**:	or you could make OVE, buy 100 PE @ 8.74, 25 PG @ 40, give a total material cost of 1874, for 20 OVE, which you can use and/or sell for the 20 OVE at 131 a piece for a total of 2620, giveing you about 746 CIS per production run


[25-Mar-25 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	Egamadeus is describing the "costs of goods manufactured" which is an important metric to understand.  some more details on this can be found here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/10qdF6wEpZshm-ErQmjyELfjcDpuXh4ZJjlB_1Wcibk4/pub


[25-Mar-25 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Egamadeus**:	Never seen that, I'll give that a look over. So far I haven't found any goods that don't make a profit, even if you buy everything from the CX. Which seems odd to me, but I am still very new to the game


[25-Mar-25 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	PT made with W comes to mind. :p


[25-Mar-25 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	SUN, SEQ, couple others. Not exactly common goods (minus the PT), but still, they're there.


[25-Mar-25 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	looking at this tool there are definitely ways for me to run my company into the ground lol, collecting hydrogen for example would run my operation -524CIS per day if i just sold it


[25-Mar-25 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it depends very much on where you collect the hydrogen


[25-Mar-25 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	I can, with the buildings I want, be net positive in 11.68 days assuming all materials are sold then purchases are made for what I need


[25-Mar-25 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	here on gibson, there is almost no hydrogen available, so it's every expensive to extract here.  but on other planets, hydrogen is much more bountiful, thus it's much cheaper there


[25-Mar-25 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ah, I see the concentration now at the top... hm i hit ROI faster if i cut my extractor


[25-Mar-25 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	a ROI of 12 days is very good


[25-Mar-25 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	yeah, I think im gonna pivot and go for a second BMP instead, has much higher profit and ROI


[25-Mar-25 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	lower ROI*


[25-Mar-25 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the other thing to consider is:  materials like FE / FEO are very heavy and hard to move.  so sometimes it makes sense to trade lower profits for easier logistics


[25-Mar-25 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	yeah, i noticed I have to balance volume and tonnage at the same time


[25-Mar-25 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	will I get better ships or just more ships?


[25-Mar-25 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you need a PRO license to do shipbuilding.  but if you have pro, you can upgrade your ships to carry more stuff, and you can also get more ships


[25-Mar-25 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	so without pro I will be stuck with my two logi ships?


[25-Mar-25 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	open the BLU command to get a sense about what type of ship customizations are possible


[25-Mar-25 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah exactly.   but to be honest, those two ships will be more than sufficient for many months


[25-Mar-25 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	there is no piracy correct? just wanna make sure here

***suspiciousfella151** joined.*


[25-Mar-25 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	correct!   if you enter into a private contract with another party (which you can't do on a free account), the other party might not fulfill their end


[25-Mar-25 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but otherwise ships fly free of pirates


[25-Mar-25 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	what is CM on the PRUN planner site?


[25-Mar-25 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	Command Module.  it's the thing you need to build to create a new base


[25-Mar-25 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ah, ok


[25-Mar-25 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RobinGad**:	Hello Gibsonians! Warehouse upgraded!


[25-Mar-25 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	The CX will have everything you might want to buy or sell. For local markets, premium or basic is required.


[25-Mar-25 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ok, I see how to buy pro, but not basic


[25-Mar-25 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	"basic" is what happens when you let your "pro" license expire


[25-Mar-25 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ahh


[25-Mar-25 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	so if I bought 1 month pro then Id be able to use local markets forever?


[25-Mar-25 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if i recall correctly, you'd be able to accept ads from local markets, and post shipping ads on the local markets, but not post your own buying/selling ads

Faction Expansion Challenge - Phase 1: Setup
Welcome to the Faction Expansion Challenge!  In the recent past, we were contacted by several players asking when player-built commodity exchanges are going to be introduced to the game. These players wanted to expand beyond the faction space and the nearby systems in order to start a new buzzing hub in the great beyond. For new hubs to really t...

Faction Expansion Challenge - Results
Hey everyone!  First of all, we want to send a huge shoutout to all participants of the Faction Expansion Challenge. Over the past four months many new planets were settled, infrastructure was built and populations grew far from the central hub regions of the universe. The amount of planning and  coordination required is certainly an achievement...

[27-Mar-25 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BarelyColdPhoenix**:	Hello, new to the game, am I supposed to wait the full 7h for my production order to finish for the starter missions ? Or is there a way to make it faster ?


[27-Mar-25 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	Hey, new here as well, you can check your contract to see if there is anything you get ahead on, for instance if you know what you want to build you can queue those materials to be produced + also travel to the commodity exchange, for instance I built a second BMP (basic materials plant) to build overalls and sell them in benten and bought the resources I'd need for that


[27-Mar-25 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BarelyColdPhoenix**:	Oh ok so I have to anticipate ^^


[27-Mar-25 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BarelyColdPhoenix**:	I see there's a contract to transport resources from a to b, is there a way to calculate how much time it will take for this with my ship ?


[27-Mar-25 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ah yes, when you go to start flying it will tell you


[27-Mar-25 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you can also use the BLU command to start a "test flight" to explore fuel usage and flight time


[27-Mar-25 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	thet timing is variable btw


[27-Mar-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	what is the best early game commodity btw


[27-Mar-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BarelyColdPhoenix**:	I don't understand how to use the blueprint but nvm I can't accept the mission my rating is too low


[27-Mar-25 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	Ok, so I recognise i most definitely not afford it currently with 18k CIS, but should I be beelining settlers/technicians?


[27-Mar-25 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	As with most things in this game, "it depends". What would those SETs/TECs be doing, and would that be more or less profitable than what you're doing now?


[27-Mar-25 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	well, im looking and I would get a lower ROI on my base, but im pretty sure some of these PRUN numbers are goofed, because its saying I can pay back a 72$ building in half a day, and if that was the case everyone would do it


[27-Mar-25 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	72K$*


[27-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	when you talk about settlers/technicans, what production building are you thinking of?


[27-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Since this is a planet with a construction CoGC, I assume you're talking about PP2 / PP3 ?


[27-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	I was thinking chem plant or clf


[27-Mar-25 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	no offence snaevarr, but I have zero F* clue what im doing


[27-Mar-25 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	They're good buildings, but I'm not sure I would pick them on Gibson.


[27-Mar-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	No worries, none taken. In the planet screen, under Infrastructure, you should see Chamber of Global Commerce.


[27-Mar-25 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Buildings that match the CoGC get a +25% bonus to production


[27-Mar-25 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	CLF seems like an unusual choice for a 2-day account.  have you taken a look at what a CLF produces?


[27-Mar-25 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	yes, I was purely looking at profit I could make, and the site was saying the profit was good


[27-Mar-25 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	(On Gibson, that'd be construction buildings. So PP1~4, WEL and UPF. But better to avoid the latter ones.)


[27-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	profit isn't the whole picture, and prunplanner's profit calculator doesn't take into account things like trade volume


[27-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ah, ok thank you snaevarr


[27-Mar-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	didnt realise that eminence so now I know to double checkit


[27-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for example, you probably want to have about a week's worth of input goods for your production line.  do you have the cash to afford that?


[27-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	or if the output good has low trade volume, you might have to wait a few weeks for anyone to buy it.  do you have the cashflow to be able to wait that long?


[27-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	when I sell my current batch yes, I couldnt afford it at the time, so i bought as many batches as I could after a week of food/water


[27-Mar-25 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	what production buildings do you have now, and how many of each do you have?


[27-Mar-25 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	2BMP producing exo on wafers + Al , and 1 BDE cooking through my PE stock


[27-Mar-25 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	sorry, 1 PP1 cooking BDE


[27-Mar-25 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i personally think your next expansions should be another PP1 or PP2


[27-Mar-25 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	ok, I was wary to build those as they seem to have much higher roi


[27-Mar-25 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Deathwatch**:	time


[27-Mar-25 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	what were you looking at to make in a hypothetical CHP?

**Deathwatch**:	SC


[27-Mar-25 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	look at the price of TA


[27-Mar-25 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you wanted to buy 10 units of TA (which would keep a CHP running for about a week), that would cost you something like 190k CIS


[27-Mar-25 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	which i'm pretty sure you don't have :)


[27-Mar-25 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SilentReaper**:	Hello Gibsonians. FIOC is looking to bring on new members to join the group. We operate different than other corps in that we share everything internally. We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs. If you're interested in how we do things, come check out our welcome page for more information. https://discord.gg/WNgrAzMdhx

[25-Apr-25 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	I'm thinking about setting up an AL+FE factory on Giedi(SP?) Prime. 1) What kind of *fabs are needed? 2) Is it profitable or should I just keep buying the metals on the CX? The eight  PP2s I have here on Gibson are extremely hungry and require a lot of transport.


[25-Apr-25 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i run 15 smelters and 7 extractors on giedi prime, and they produce about 45 FE per day and 92 AL per day


[25-Apr-25 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you need HSE to build on giedi prime


[25-Apr-25 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(also INS)


[25-Apr-25 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and yeah, transport of these metals kind of requires a heavy hauler


[25-Apr-25 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Ementior ( AM-783c ) would be another option. Better ALO than Giedi Prime and all green environmentals (so cheap to build and repair), but no FEO (LST instead) and a bit further out.


[25-Apr-25 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	deimos (ZV-759c) might be a tiny bit closer than ementior?


[25-Apr-25 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	BLU says it's the same number of jumps. Total hours spent flying is similar as well.


[25-Apr-25 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	More importantly though, Deimos is full. Ementior still has plenty of space.


[25-Apr-25 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-25 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Egamadeus**:	Build the habitats for them, in the Construction menu look at the Settler Habitation,Technician Habitationand so forth


[25-Apr-25 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Egamadeus**:	The other population buildings are combined buildings, good for optimazing area, but not cost


[25-Apr-25 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Forger**:	so they automatically turn into settlers?


[25-Apr-25 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no.  each planet has different numbers of each population on them


[25-Apr-25 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Egamadeus**:	You can use the POPR JS-952c command to view Gibson's pop report


[25-Apr-25 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Forger**:	thanks


[25-Apr-25 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	at the moment there's about 9800 settlers looking for jobs, so if you build habs for them, they'll come to work on your production lines :)

**Nikarus2370**:	Hello


[29-Apr-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Hey there


[29-Apr-25 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	so I followed the guide and the starting contracts. i guess I'm just waiting a few hours for the initial production cycles to be finished before it'll direc tme further?


[29-Apr-25 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	The tutorial and starting contracts cover the basics and not much else. Some players (SeaPear comes to mind, but there are others) have made guides for new players, that go over things not mentioned by the official tutorial.


[29-Apr-25 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	For most new players it's probably best to wait until they have something to sell at the nearest CX at Benten. Shipping is expensive early on. You'll want to bring back enough consumables and input materials to keep you going for a few days. Any additional profit can be used to grow your base.


[29-Apr-25 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	What happens beyond that is up to you. Some people try to become self-sufficient in an effort to lower their expenses. Others go up the tech tree for more profit. And you're not limited to just one industry - you can branch out into chemistry or whatever calls to you as well.


[29-Apr-25 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	so basically, if i picked the food processor. Spend a few days making rations, ship them to a trade place and buy up stuff to build more processors and housing/bases


[29-Apr-25 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	That's the gist of it. It should be mentioned though that this planet gives bonus efficiency to buildings in the construction industry, not to food processing. That doesn't mean it won't work, just that's there are better options than Gibson if you want to focus on food processing more.


[29-Apr-25 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	*just that


[29-Apr-25 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	is there a place to see the bonuses. When I was on the planet select screen the soil fertility and resource windows were bugging out I guess. This was the only one that didn't have the "Very far from an exchange" warning


[29-Apr-25 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Many planets will have a so called Chamber of Global Commerce (CoGC). Not every planet has one, but if it does, it should be under the infrastructure tab.


[29-Apr-25 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	aah I see


[29-Apr-25 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Besides the CoGC, there are different factions as well. Each faction gives a small bonus to a certain industry, and it's possible to switch between these by moving your company headquarters. The Castillo-Ito Mercantile (CI) faction, which includes Gibson, gives a 10% bonus to manufacturing. NEO gives a bonus to metallurgy and construction, AI to electronics, IC to agriculture and food processing. Anyone with their headquarters outside of faction space gets a bonus to chemistry, fuel refining and resource extraction.


[29-Apr-25 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	Hah, well looks like I messed up then. And scrapping my buildings won't cover transitioning to extractor (fe) collector (o) and smelter for iron/steel (would still need carbon anyways)


[29-Apr-25 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you're not required to play optimally, especially in the beginning


[29-Apr-25 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	keep that in mind for your future buildings, that's all


[29-Apr-25 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	@MapReduce is right. Think of it more as guidelines.


[29-Apr-25 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If, however, you were dead-set on (for example) farming, liquidating the company and starting over on Promitor would probably be faster and/or better than trying to make farming work on Gibson. If you wanted to go with construction or manufacturing though, Gibson definitely isn't the worst choice.


[29-Apr-25 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	yeah I think I might reset. as it'd be a few 100k to buy the stuff to build the stuff for basic construction at this point


[29-Apr-25 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	er maybe it's still worth sticking with it (math)


[29-Apr-25 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Typing COLIQ in a new buffer will allow you to reset if and when you're ready for it. Might be worth figuring out first what you want to focus on though. Most things can be done profitably, so provided you're interested in a given field, you have options.


[29-Apr-25 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	oh i didn't know you could do that too


[29-Apr-25 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If you don't mind me asking, what starting package did you pick?


[29-Apr-25 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	i'd picked the food one


[29-Apr-25 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Food processing?


[29-Apr-25 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	yeah. but on planet select it wasn't showing the bar for soil fertility


[29-Apr-25 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	in later screens it looks like it was getting chopped off on the side, so i definitely picked the wrong planet


[29-Apr-25 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Gibson is indeed not all that good for farming. It's worth remembering that agriculture and food processing are 2 different specialisations though.


[29-Apr-25 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	It began with a V


[29-Apr-25 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Victualler


[29-Apr-25 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	The ideal farming planet is generally considered to be Promitor, in the Hortus system. Even they tend to keep their farming and food processing on seperate planets though (in this case Avalon). COLIQing and restarting there is an option, but would make branching out into other industries slightly more difficult than staying in CI space.


[29-Apr-25 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Our region of space has a few nice farming planets, but none quite as good as Promitor. Alternatively you could stay put and just import the raw agricultural products for food processors, or even pivot into a different industry. There's no obvious right choice beyond what you feel suits you.


[29-Apr-25 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikarus2370**:	well i gotta go to work so I guess I'll figure it out later. Looks like it'd be ~150k total build a couple habs, iron, and a prefab plant. Ill do some spreadsheeting to figure ot "Is it worth working towards that, or resetting"


[29-Apr-25 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Alrighty. Planet chat can get a bit quiet sometimes, so global chat might be the better option - more people'll see it that way. Prunplanner can also help you calculate the profitability of anything you might be thinking of.
