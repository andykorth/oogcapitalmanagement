[27-Sep-21 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	I'm so happy I set myself up with a 16day stockpile the day before


[27-Sep-21 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mrtplank**:	it's putting pressure on my expansion though as I'm expecting everyone elses prices to increase


[27-Sep-21 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cpt.Hodor**:	How did that happen anyway?


[27-Sep-21 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	most likely market speculations


[27-Sep-21 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoxW**:	Does anyone have an extra 30 DW I can borrow or buy?  I can return it in 2 days or pay extra for my poor planning


[28-Sep-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tungsten**:	Anyone selling BBH or BSE locally? Prefer to buy local before going to CX if I can. Slowly working toward more structures


[28-Sep-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	generally speaking if folks are carting stuff out here it's for their own expansion -- not a lot of construction here probably.  if so i'd bet it's more pp2 doing lfab production.  getting iron and lst out here is... inefficient


[28-Sep-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tungsten**:	Yeah. Right now it seems like it is almost better to fly out to MOR to sell stuff and buy building supplies


[28-Sep-21 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	yep.  i run a pp1 on katoa and i started flying to mor to buy fe/lst -- and quickly realized the benefits of just buying the fabs out there too.  i still run the pp1 so i have a constant stream of BSE being produced for my own use, but i generally buy fabs in mor if i can


[29-Sep-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Hey all! Just landed, and I forgot to bring 1 BDE and 2 BSE :|

[01-Oct-21 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	Whew, 2 SST are complete


[01-Oct-21 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	Okay, what can I say, for me it is business as normal, I just built 2 levels of SST, next will be one level of INF as health is not an issue. Then it is PAR time, to boost Tech Levels as more people build POLs and PPFs.

[11-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	FF is a bit hard for everyone right now. At the start one person took control of the entire FF trade on Ben and forced almost everyone off creating it them selves, now that supply has run out, people are starting to create it again.


[11-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	But that means people looking to make a quick buck selling HE3 at steep prices


[11-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Citronnade**:	despite the huge cost of HE3 it feels weird that refining TS is also like unprofitable--I guess TS also went up?


[11-Nov-21 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aldin**:	jump in population not necessarily corelates to new players


[16-Nov-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Nov-21 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Willger**:	let others confirm it for you, i was there when the wave hit

**Teeriak**:	Hi everybody, can anyone tell me if it makes sense to build a COL on Umbra? Or is this just a waste of resources?


[10-Dec-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tungsten**:	Kind of depends on what you are planning to do with the H but it can be a decent way to make some money early on. More experienced players may have a different take


[10-Dec-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Teeriak**:	Primalery for PE-production, so that I don't have to buy everything at the CX.


[10-Dec-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tungsten**:	I think it is probably worth it if you are using it to make PE to make other stuff that you'll mostly sell but the current PE market is in the toilet so I wouldn't stretch too thin on your income side


[10-Dec-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	H is useful for several different uses so has a solid demand behind it


[10-Dec-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	It has a solid profit per hour behind it even if you just ship it to the CX to sell


[10-Dec-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Most people here would be producing their own however so not sure if there would be much demand in the LM


[10-Dec-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	it's a good product but low concentration for a starting base 11H / d and an extractor costs around 400/d so minimal profit


[10-Dec-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	in begining of universe this used to be a high concentration planet but nowadays H is imported by lot of residents


[10-Dec-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	sales aren't that spectacular either


[10-Dec-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Xk37**:	I presume that was a different planet since there is no jobs here. Maybe that time it was caused by some else's building and it just appeared to be from your PP4?


[13-Dec-21 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	^^ That would be the case


[13-Dec-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	doubt it because now I housed them and I got all the engineers


[14-Dec-21 03:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	There is always a buffer of workers. Not all workers created will be immediately assigned to a person. So when you make a open job, you pull from that buffer


[14-Dec-21 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ginoalni**:	Also, no open jobs!


[14-Dec-21 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	ok so long story short, I went to Gibson dropped a PP4 and open jobs appeared for engineers, the planet barely had any techs at that time so this is not about worker pool


[14-Dec-21 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	if you look 1month 4d ago when I dropped the PP4 the open jobs were up and I had no HB4 and I sincerely doubt anyone has or had any engineer housing for the 181 techs and 1 engineer


[14-Dec-21 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	the discussions on the planet were that they were even considering if they will need techs to grow them so... assuming someone felt generous to build a HB4 when pop was so low is a bit unlikely


[14-Dec-21 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	but maybe you're right, will find out at next POPR if I am the sole employer :)


[14-Dec-21 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ginoalni**:	Rittuk Ships in C regularly, I produce 100 per day locally on Umbra, which I am current taking steps to expand that to 200 per day as I am always behind on contracts.

So I'll be running for governor in his stead in order to maintain and grow Umbra's infrastructure during Gino's absence. I'll be happy to step down when Gino returns. I would appreciate your vote so we can put Umbra's tax revenue to use to fuel to growth of the planet. Thanks!

Is anyone planning on pushing towards higher workforce tiers (ie. techs and engineers). Or should we focus on pioneer growth since the unemployment rate is getting low. Any thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated!

[02-Mar-22 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	if you go to construction, and then hover over the (i) next to workforce it semi-explains


[02-Mar-22 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	it seems maybe there is a pool of 'immediately available' workers, otherwise maybe we have to wait for the 'weekly redistribution' of workers. I dont think ive ever encountered this before, and im still trying to understand why the 'immediately available pool of workers' is empty


[02-Mar-22 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	There is a “workforce reserve pool” of a certain size on each planet. This means a percentage of workers of each workforce tier will not be distributed automatically but is held back. Workers from the reserve pool can be recruited instantly during the week by building a new production building that requires them. However, each player can only instantly recruit a small percentage of the pool for themselves every week. (Note: If there are more players requiring workers of a certian tier than there are workers, these workers will be added to the reserve pool as well.)


[02-Mar-22 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	maybe I / we have already taken too many PIO this week?

I think we need to make it more clear how the unemployment values are being calculated!  When the population report is being generated (even before the growth or decline of the population is determined) the unemployment for the last week is being calculated. It is as simple as 1 - (current workforce requests / current population). This unemploym...

[02-Mar-22 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ritteruk**:	Hmm I have actually lost some PIOs and am no longer fully covered, we have educated them too much and they do not want to work on the shop floor anymore!


[02-Mar-22 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	i think this advanced education III program is the reason. we "lost" 8k PIO to Education. I am also missing some PIO because of that. Don't know if that program serves the majority of people on this planet.


[02-Mar-22 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	ok interesting, I see


[02-Mar-22 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	the more I look, the more complicated this game is haha!


[02-Mar-22 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	well it certain made a bump on the graph, in terms of settlers / pioneers


[02-Mar-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	there's no unemployment at the higher tiers, maybe thats what the govener is trying to solve, getting more people up there?


[02-Mar-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	but has possibly clobbered the PIO levels


[02-Mar-22 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	I guess maybe next week we could try a 'increase pioneer settlement' program


[02-Mar-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	@Nicster is correct, the cause of the issue was the advanced education III program. POPI and planetary population changes are one the most complicated things in the game and I was trying to increase the growth of higher population tiers but did not expect the program to cause that much movement otherwise I wouldn't have done it.

**Xk37**:	haha - it's apparently surprised several governors


[02-Mar-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	The information provided by the devs about the new government programs was very vague and on top of that the intricacies of how the populations move is very complicated so that only compounded the issue


[02-Mar-22 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	The focus now will be on rebuilding the PIO and SET populations


[02-Mar-22 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	A lot of that should be taken care of with the next POPR as open jobs should encourage higher immigration rates


[02-Mar-22 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	In addition I'm trying to determine which government program will have the biggest impact on PIO growth and will run that one for the next POPR


[02-Mar-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	Hang in there everyone, we'll get through this :)


[02-Mar-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Mar-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	hey Wilbur, thanks for everything, and the explanation. No stress on my end, as I said above, and you reiterated, this stuff is complicated! Looks like you were trying to do a good thing, but it had unintended side effects!


[02-Mar-22 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	After talking with the POPI experts about how best to recover the lost PIO population I'm going to give Festivities III a shot as the government program for the next POPR.


[02-Mar-22 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	A 20% happiness boost across all worker tiers plus the open jobs at the PIO level should result in a significant PIO migration number next POPR

**Citronnade**:	I had the 7-day bug and my buildings use a multiple of 3 for prefabs so I think I had until the 67th day to repair, it was the 64th day (but I'm always skeptical that the 7-day bug is really giving me a full 7 days)

[05-Mar-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Citronnade**:	but now doing the math it makes sense that if unemployment is ~6% and reserve pool is ~10% then it's expected for some pioneers to still not be available--although I expected it to be less than 15%


[05-Mar-22 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	I think the unemployment rates shown in the POPR are before the effects of the POPR. The PIO unemployment rate right now would be 0% because there aren't any PIO without jobs.


[05-Mar-22 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	There are unfilled PIO jobs since everyone lost PIO after the POPR

[31-Mar-22 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I think you're right - looking at it now I see zero votes for electronics for the next cycle.


[31-Mar-22 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Alexpuddy**:	Any suggestions where I should sell my Magnesite. Benten Station Exchange isn't really giving results.


[01-May-22 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Market is probably flooded, MG/MGS in very high abundance


[01-May-22 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	I managed to sell partial earlier today


[01-May-22 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Do I really have to fly so far away to other exchange stations?


[01-May-22 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	If you want more money, i guess yes


[01-May-22 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	1 day 9 hours on low settings, not too bad


[01-May-22 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	experiment with the sliders, there’s a sweet spot and for very little extra fuel you can halve that timd


[01-May-22 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	The best I can get is like 1 day 4 hours on minimum reactor and 1/8 fuel


[01-May-22 03:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Umbra to Benten Station??


[01-May-22 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	And the reactor only adjust time by a few minutes unless it's above 45%


[01-May-22 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Umbra to Moria station


[01-May-22 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Umbra to Benten I just do slowest cause I'm in no rush


[01-May-22 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Why fly to Moria?


[01-May-22 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	To sell magnesite


[01-May-22 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	And Iron


[01-May-22 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I don’t think the economics of that are going to hold up


[01-May-22 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Ok


[01-May-22 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Not unless you’re taking a lot of MGS


[01-May-22 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I’d sit down with a spreadsheet for a bit first!


[01-May-22 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Only have 36, but I have a constant production


[01-May-22 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yeah I wouldn’t be flying anywhere just now then


[01-May-22 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Can you use the LM?


[01-May-22 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	No


[01-May-22 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	H is going to sell better than MGS I suspect


[01-May-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	I don't have the structures to extract H though


[01-May-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	I started with metallurgy


[01-May-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I believe you might be on the wrong planet then


[01-May-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Yea... I kind of figured


[01-May-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Not that it matters exactly what you chose, gou


[01-May-22 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	can demolish the EXT and probably still build a COL


[01-May-22 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Or COLIQ and start again real quick


[01-May-22 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Should I keep my smelter too?


[01-May-22 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You’re going to struggle to supply the goods


[01-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You need to fly in heavy ore, carbon and oxygen


[01-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Alright


[01-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	carbon is already in intense demand


[01-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Guess I'm liquidating


[01-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Oh well, all part of learning the game


[01-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It’s no loss, you can start more precisely and be ahead of where you are in a matter of days


[01-May-22 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Thanks for the info Neke


[01-May-22 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you come back to Umbra build COLs, I’m not sure what the packages are or what they give you


[01-May-22 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Can I just COLIQ and it takes care of everything?


[01-May-22 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you want a simpler start extracting, come to my homeworld on Katoa an extra other minerals in the exchange system


[01-May-22 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Yea I believe so


[01-May-22 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alexpuddy**:	Alrighty


[01-May-22 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Aug-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	For those of you impacted by the TECH shortage, I'm running the Planetary Festivities III gov program for the next POPR. This will hopefully help offset a bit of the shortage caused by player base expansions


[12-Aug-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	Unfortunately we are effectively exceeded the max fulfillment out current POPI can provide and need a pretty significant expansion to meet current population demands and allow for future growth


[12-Aug-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	At minimum I'm planning another PAR and ART with the help of @drmambo but I'll likely end up building another SST and INF too


[12-Aug-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wilbur8x**:	I'll be doing a deep dive into POPI this weekend to try and figure out a plan


[12-Aug-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Hmm, why exactly would the game suggest that starting in Benten is a bad fit for a constructor? Is there some hidden logic to it that I'm missing out on?


[12-Sep-22 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Benten is a decent place for constructors. Both LST and FE can take a lot of shipping though


[12-Sep-22 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so most constructors start around Benten on Proxion or Gibson


[12-Sep-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you stick to just PE -> BDE, you'd just need to ship the C in over here


[12-Sep-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	im a constructor in Kiruna, brought my O and LST from Proxion, planning to get FLX from here


[12-Sep-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I did initially start on Gibson since that was recommended, but I fail to see the benefit shipping-wise? STL fuel makes for better profit margins than FTL?


[12-Sep-22 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	a starter ship can only hold 64 FE or 183 LST


[12-Sep-22 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so if you have too many PP1s... you'll find it hard to keep them supplied


[12-Sep-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	The main difference between STL and FTL fuel is planets orbit. FTL jumps are more consistent than just STL flight


[12-Sep-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
***EyangKodok** deleted this message.*


[12-Sep-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	nvm, cant have too much PP1.


[12-Sep-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	later into the game.. FTL engines are much more expensive than STL engines


[12-Sep-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I can see the benefit to FTL allowing for closer arrivals, certainly. I was just concerned there were some other thing like 'Plants being more efficent on certain worlds'


[12-Sep-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	planets tend to be specilized to certain industries. Gibson typically has projects for Construction while Umbra mainly does Chemistry


[12-Sep-22 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	STL flight around Benten does damage ships quite fast as well


[12-Sep-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	due to micro meteorites


[12-Sep-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Aha, thank you. When I launched from Gibson I seemed to end up with the same 3% damage as well, since I ended up trading with Benten GX anyway


[12-Sep-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FTL flight paths typically deal significantly less damage


[12-Sep-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Must have had a stroke of bad luck


[12-Sep-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Thanks for the information, much appreciated


[12-Sep-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there is quite a learning curve, so be sure to ask lots of questions!


[12-Sep-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dormanation**:	do I have to hire pioneers or does it do it on its own

**Inforiel**:	Anyone who could advise me on when & how to repair the starter spaceships?


[12-Sep-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	buy BHP, make sure its in your base inventory, then select the ship you want to repair (at the same base) and hit repair


[12-Sep-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	each BHP repairs 2% of your ship.. and you don;t need to repair until 80% condition


[12-Sep-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Or, 90% if you already have the 9 BHP

**TonyJ**:	how do I get the resources I bought from a commodity exchange?


[15-Feb-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	To get the resources from the CX you need to fly your ship there. You will be able to complete the transactions when there is somwhere for you purchases to go (into your ship) or if you have warehouse space on the CX.


[15-Feb-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I hope you made the purchases from the Benton Station CX, otherwise you will be making a long trip to get them or selling the back at a loss.

[17-Feb-23 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	Your goods should be "saved" in contracts. You can go there with a ship and take them with you or sell them to get your money back.

**Felmer**:	and the real blockbuster worthy scene is the second ship fast burning after the first one and still 5 pallets standing at the docks


[09-Mar-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Then - explosions


[09-Mar-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	KOM delivery - Directed by Michael Bay


[09-Mar-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	need something of higher proof than KOM to have decent explosions...


[09-Mar-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'd recommend GIN


[09-Mar-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	KOMbustion


[09-Mar-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	Even funnier are the cut scenes to dusty piles stuck halfway inbound in RC-040 f (300u) and of all places Biogenesis (204u).  Now zoom out from the KOM pallets in Benten and in the background you'll see mounds of 10 of the 14 materials needed to build a 2000/2000 FTL hauler and enough FF and SF to fuel it.  I may just name her the "Irony" when built.

**HansFlamme**:	kindoff


[24-Apr-23 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	katoa is the only decent starter for fuel


[24-Apr-23 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	why katoa?


[24-Apr-23 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	it has gal onsite


[24-Apr-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	but at 10.20 it's not even that decent


[24-Apr-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	SF.CI1


[24-Apr-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	I thought the money is in FF


[24-Apr-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you can try to make it here


[24-Apr-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you will have to buy both H and HE3


[24-Apr-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	H can be extracted from atmo


[24-Apr-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	i only need to buy HE3


[24-Apr-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	cb-282d is the best source for h around here and orm for he3


[24-Apr-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	I bought a bit for SF but only for my personal use in the ships


[24-Apr-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	so best to buy it there?


[24-Apr-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	best to get it delivered at a good price


[24-Apr-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	its hard to be in those business without a ship built for it


[24-Apr-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	well you can ship it with the starter ships aswell


[24-Apr-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	can but not well a vcb can carry 6 starter ships worth


[24-Apr-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	true but you need a lot of money for a better ship i assume


[24-Apr-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	if the cx prices are good u can try and move it to umbra


[24-Apr-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	cx prices?


[24-Apr-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	on the left click cxl


[24-Apr-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	benton is very close to you


[24-Apr-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Commodity Exchange, nearest one for Umbra would be Benten


[24-Apr-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Ask is 280 for HE3


[24-Apr-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	id learn as much as u can and consider coliq if u lose all your starting capital. umbra isn't the easiest start and FF is not really a day1 thing you want to make


[24-Apr-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	promitor is easy to run and you can't get a base there without starting there. katoa here too but fuel is way over produced


[24-Apr-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	the easiest starts are probably ones where one of the natural resources are in good quantities and you can extract it and sell it


[24-Apr-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	hmmm is being a producer of raw mats viable in this game?


[24-Apr-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	yes but some heavy mats are only viable if you can sell on the LM which requires basic


[24-Apr-23 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	I do have a basic licence


[24-Apr-23 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	etherwind is great for that RE


[24-Apr-23 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	RE?


[24-Apr-23 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	resource extraction


[24-Apr-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	ah i see


[24-Apr-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	well i shall try to make this fuel thing work if it does not i can always coliq and try that RE thingy


[24-Apr-23 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	any good external guides for this game beyond the base tutorial that you guys can recommend?


[24-Apr-23 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	excel


[24-Apr-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Excel ain´t a guide^^ but yeah i will have to set up spreadsheets


[24-Apr-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	get on the discords and check out the tools already available


[24-Apr-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	prunner is great for planning


[24-Apr-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	pct has links to various tools


[24-Apr-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	a lot of starts are very easy. you can look around for one then coliq if u want


[24-Apr-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	just make sure it's not already over produced


[24-Apr-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HansFlamme**:	Hey thanks for the help guys, i will take my time and do a bit more reading on the game and just hustle this fuel thing along, lets see if i can turn it a profit^^


[24-Apr-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	or start in a place that you can't get other wise like prom, katoa, montem, vallis


[24-Apr-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	ill never get prom it has been full for over a year

**Aufricer**:	Bit late for the party BUT. Production of food or even Carbon might be not the worst thing to do.


[24-Apr-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Or while you are here: Consider mining the Magnesite and use a "BMP" building to produce Magnesium (I dont do it, so not sure about the profit) but price for Magnesium is > 65 per unit.


[24-Apr-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So there is plenty of things that are in demand and might be done fast and easy

**PepeIsLepen**:	hey, im beggining as a manufacturer, but carbon price is high and PE price is low, so is it a good idea ? or its better to restart as another class ?


[14-Jul-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PepeIsLepen**:	im in benten so the prices are for benten CX


[14-Jul-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thoern**:	Katoa is a much better place for manufacturing start because of 25% efficiency bonus from CoGC


[14-Jul-23 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	PE.CI1 8.70 is actually pretty high. Umbra has the advantage of local H so making PE here at the beginning is not a bad idea, but Katoa is better in the long run


[14-Jul-23 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	manufacturing start is pretty flexible - if you don't like PE prices, switch to something else, there are a lot of recipes in BMP

**KarimTheGrim**:	Hello, Umbranians! Do you know whether the commodities contribute to the upkeep of our university equally? That is, would 100 REA and 100 TUB contribue equally to the upkeep level (100 of each are consumed every 3 days)?


[02-Sep-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KarimTheGrim**:	It also looks like education might not be fulfilled any more than culture, so I should instead dump money into wildlife park... But I don't know how to check, I just see that the numbers for "culture" and "education" needs fulfilment are the same


[02-Sep-23 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	equally, yes


[02-Sep-23 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	and also yes, higher tier needs can only be fulfilled as much as lower tier needs


[02-Sep-23 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	grouped like this: Safety & Health, Comfort & Culture, Education


[02-Sep-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KarimTheGrim**:	right, but comfort is fulfilled higher than culture, so I should focus on culture if I want to get more scientists


[02-Sep-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KarimTheGrim**:	it's written in the help page, but it didn't dawn on me before that "Needs of a higher tier can only be fulfilled as well as the worst-fulfilled need of the tier below."


[02-Sep-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Yes, no point adding extra education consumables if you don’t supply health

[11-Sep-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	The similarities with lineage 2 are endless... basically a copy/paste.. can't believe I never noticed it before you mentioned it.. thanks for opening my eyes!


[11-Sep-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KarimTheGrim**:	idk but it feels like those folks that were buying my B-grade crystals with 300% markup moved here and started doing the same with MED


[11-Sep-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KarimTheGrim**:	sure, there's no cat gang raidboss here in PrUn, but you really can't have an identical game


[11-Sep-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	Karim, I'm new here too, 2 days old... but I'm an accountant IRL, play EVE, and already bought PRO... (that's supposed to vouch for my credibility)... would you be willing to do a loan contract with me? I need liquidity!


[11-Sep-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KarimTheGrim**:	What's your plan, boss, what are you going to do with extra cabbage from a loan?


[11-Sep-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	im going to build my production infrastructure, seems pretty easy to make money, i just need to scale up and vertically integrate upstream


[11-Sep-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	(started as manufacturer)


[11-Sep-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	but with the 2 (soon to be 3) BMPs I have online, it's just gonna take forever to get going with how little I can produce atm... if I can hit the ground running it'll save me like 4-6 weeks of slow grind


[11-Sep-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	after BMP 3, gonna get a collector for Hydrogen, keep making PE, then will get an Extractor for MGS and switch to making PG... I'll have to keep buying carbon for a while, but will eventually supply my own


[11-Sep-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	then with both PG and PE and can make OVE, or maybe add H2O and do DW as well (haven't priced them out yet to know what's more lucrative)


[11-Sep-23 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	H2O would take a 2nd base, so it'd have to be worth it.. but id also get access to O, AMM, GAL (on Katoa) so I'll have to look into the possibilities when i get closer to considering a 2nd base


[11-Sep-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordFacepalm**:	a 2nd base for H2O would also let me do a hydroponics farm, could finally source my own C

[27-Sep-23 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If anyone could spare like 50 LST it'd be greatly appreciated :) LM ad up on Umbra. I forgot I had FLX orders going and accidentally took my LST back to my other base lol


[27-Sep-23 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If you're interested and have less than 50 available I could go as low as 10-20


[27-Sep-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Did you get LST? I can provide it.


[27-Sep-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Ya I closed the market when I realized lol I doubt there'd be a good enough price for me to buy


[20-Oct-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	But then again according to prunner I make around 900/day after using it for other things


[20-Oct-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	now that is nice production. not quite up to that yet but if the markey can sustain it....


[20-Oct-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I shut 90% of my umbra base down when I opened up another base so I just restructured what I had lol


[20-Oct-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Inforiel**:	You'll have no shortage of buyers on either for the right price - but the extraction rate on Umbra is pretty low, you might want to consider a permit into a better extraction base and increase your own production demand soon


[28-Oct-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, it's on the list of things to do, but probably not for many weeks

**Tear777**:	Hi


[05-Jan-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tear777**:	If I want to buy stuff from the Benton Station commodoties exchange, I need to send a ship there first yes?


[05-Jan-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tear777**:	commodities*


[05-Jan-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	you can buy it without a ship there, but it will have to go somewhere. You can rent warehouse space there to hold your things till you pick them up (recommended), or if you don't do that it will geterate a contract for the pickup


[05-Jan-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	renting a warehouse is cheap and is recommended for anyone doing regular business at a commodoties exchange


[05-Jan-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tear777**:	Thank you. So If I have a ship there, it goe sonto my ship yes?


[05-Jan-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	correct, if you don't have a warehouse, but you have a ship at the station, orders will go into your ship cargo

[05-Jan-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**simdimdim**:	if you have multiple locations it can go to that is


[05-Jan-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**simdimdim**:	contacts also have their uses, since they save you from having to store the stuff

[10-Jan-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Fuel production is small potatoes. I have a refinery on each of my major planets so that I can refuel when ever I stop. You don't make serious credits selling fuel.

**BlueHeeler**:	Every major planet that I have a base. It makes sense because then I can go fro planet to planet without returning to a fueling location. My current petty cash balance is 1,815,706. All of my bases and ships are better than 90%. I don't think the refineries are hurting my bottom line.

**xensored**:	@BlueHeeler Right, they might not hurt but if you would use that area more effective you would get a lot more money out of it


[11-Jan-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	xensored is right that it'll be more profitable if you have a dedicated fuel planet. It's also true that having REF/fuel storage on all your planets will give you peice of mind and/or save you RL time.


[11-Jan-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	My point is that the optimal choice is based on what's important to you, and because this is a game, seeking profit is not the only consideration which should go into making investment decisions


[11-Jan-24 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	IE: it can be both "less profitable" and "correct" to have REF on every base. BlueHeeler can make whatever choice he'd like and doesn't have to justify it to anyone


[11-Jan-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But you have to organize also inputs for the REFs on every planet, right? For me that sounds much more complicated than fuel production on one planet, send it to your hub and distribute it to all planets from time to time without a REF on every planet. Should be sufficient to have several k fuel on every planet and refill it from time to time. I never heard about building one REF on every major planet. Of course he can do whatever he want, I'd change it for sure. just a well-intentioned hint, no offense ;)


[11-Jan-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I'm not saying I'd run things like that either, just that I don't think we should yuk someone else's yum.


[11-Jan-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Also, I'm not sure he needs any hints, their account is older than both of ours :P


[11-Jan-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	or it is the reason for only 1.8mil cash with such an old account. of course anyone (i repeat it was meant as urgent hint to change it for more profit, not to criticize him) can play like he wants to but sometimes people are also interested in any hints from players who exceeded more than 1 bil net worth in a shorter time :p

[13-Jan-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	people don't really build ENG, they build FSE


[13-Jan-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	slightly more expensive, much more efficient


[13-Jan-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	good point


[13-Jan-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	I'm surprised that there are any people at all making ENG


[13-Jan-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah, but cheaper ships extend their liquidity to other things.


[13-Jan-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You could argue that FSE is better, but if they only intend to use ENGs within reasonable parameters of its impulse capability + tonnage ratings, then they are justified.


[13-Jan-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Thanks to LEAD, you can message those peeps. Ask them why they do bad things... XD


[13-Jan-24 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jan-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	if you want to go for cheap try GEN


[14-Jan-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	it's the cheapest you can get


[14-Jan-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	and no, you can't tow sadly


[14-Jan-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	a 500/500 GEN ship probably costs under a million while an ENG or FSE already costs a million per pop, just for perspective :D

**Joskoura_Threehead**:	Hello, everyone. Is there a way to abandon your account and start over with another one?


[28-Jan-24 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**KingBR**:	You dont need another account, just type COLIQ into a new buffer and it will show a option to reset your company from zero

**New-Worlds**:	Why TF dose every comand i do say "illegal comand"


[14-Feb-24 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	can you give an example of a command you tried?


[14-Feb-24 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**New-Worlds**:	I tryed CXO tabed to it and others.


[14-Feb-24 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**New-Worlds**:	None work


[14-Feb-24 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	"CXO" requires that you give it an order identifier -- did you do that?


[14-Feb-24 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	does a command like "MAT SF" work ?


[14-Feb-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**New-Worlds**:	Yes but how do you pull up the genral info of thangs sutch as your exchng order list.


[14-Feb-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	try CXOS


[14-Feb-24 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**New-Worlds**:	I did, dose not work


[14-Feb-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**New-Worlds**:	I do not yet understand what it wants form me. I think I am jest bad.


[14-Feb-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm not sure why CXOS doesn't work.  maybe ask in the global help channel, or hang around for someone more knowledgable than me

**EyangKodok**:	By giving them a Stimulus contract which will help them stay afloat, but to accept they need to purcase PRO once (:


[15-Mar-24 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	I personally think it's a great incentive for them to get PRO, as i belive that you truely play ProUn once you got your PRO LIC that will lead to BASIC LIC

**Aahz**:	Welcome Mechwing


[06-Apr-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	Hello Aahz


[06-Apr-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	Right now watching some YT on how to and where I am going.


[06-Apr-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	If you have questions the public channels and discord are good places to ask.  And of course the tutorials are good to start with if you haven't gone through them yet.


[06-Apr-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I got the base setup, and 1 basic materials plant


[06-Apr-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I am trying to build MCG and I have the materials. When I queue the order. I see it in my production lines tile but it says input missing.


[06-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I have the materials in my inventory


[06-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you have both LST and SIO ?


[06-Apr-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	yes


[06-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and at least 4 LST and 2 SIO?


[06-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	are you sure they're in your base inventory?  maybe they're still in your ship inventory?


[06-Apr-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	Inventory BS, I unloaded them from my fleet ships


[06-Apr-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ok, so far sounds like you did all the right things


[06-Apr-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	maybe you could send a screenshot ?


[06-Apr-24 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	How can I do that in this chat?


[06-Apr-24 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you'd have to upload it to an image sharing site and then share the URL.  you could use imgur.    i have a private image sharing site if you want (paste the image into https://up.em32.site/ )


[06-Apr-24 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok hang on for a minute.


[06-Apr-24 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok I pasted the screen shot.


[06-Apr-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you should see a link (4 letters long)   click it to get the full URL and share the URL here

[06-Apr-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ah ha, i see the problem :


[06-Apr-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	:)


[06-Apr-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you picked an order size of 10


[06-Apr-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	the planet self destructed?


[06-Apr-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	which means you need 10 times more input.  so you need 40 LST and 20 SIO


[06-Apr-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so you


[06-Apr-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	oh I see what you are saying


[06-Apr-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so you'll need to cancel the order and queue up a smaller one


[06-Apr-24 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I should have done 5 not 10


[06-Apr-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you click the "Details" button, you should see exactly how much input materials you need


[06-Apr-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I did and cancelled the order and did another one for 5 units


[06-Apr-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	sorry 5 times which will output 250 units


[06-Apr-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep


[06-Apr-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok now I got the 2nd order up now PE


[06-Apr-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it'll take about 1 day for that order to finish


[06-Apr-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I see that. So after that is done what is there to do next because I am limited since I just started.


[06-Apr-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	well, to start you won't be space limited, you'll be money limited.  if you just have 2 habitation buildings and 2 BMPs, you'll have plenty of space to build more builds, but that'll cost materials


[06-Apr-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I am looking at the local commodity exchange right now


[06-Apr-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep, you'll be buying and selling almost all of your stuff on the Benten commodity exchange


[06-Apr-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the game loop is basically:  buy stuff (like LST / SIO), turn it into more valuable stuff (like MCG), sell it to get money to then buy more stuff


[06-Apr-24 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	How do I collect my planets resources that it currently has?


[06-Apr-24 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	oh nevermind I see collection


[06-Apr-24 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it depends on the resource.  here on Umbra we have Hydrogen and Magnesite.  to get Hydrogen, you need to build a Collector


[06-Apr-24 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and to get MGS, you need an Extractor


[06-Apr-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	note that each building will require a certain number of workers.  these workers will need supplies like DW (Drinking Water) and RAT (Basic Rations).  you'll need to buy (or make) these to keep your workers happy


[06-Apr-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(if you run out of things like DW and RAT, your buildings will still run, but much much more slowly)


[06-Apr-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	that is good to know


[06-Apr-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok I see I need to get BSE on the commodity exchange. how do I place an order?


[06-Apr-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	oh neveromind I see that on the right side, info, chart, orders, trade


[06-Apr-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep, you found it.  click the 'trade' button


[06-Apr-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok I put in quantity of 100 units because I don't understand the price limit


[06-Apr-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	100 units of BSE is a lot.  you probably don't have the cash for that


[06-Apr-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	do you see how to open the order book for BSE?


[06-Apr-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	yes i see the order book


[06-Apr-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	when buying, the price limit is the maximum price that you'll buy for.  when selling, the price limit is the lowest price that you'll sell for


[06-Apr-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok I undertstand


[06-Apr-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you entered a price limit of 1500, your order would not be instantly fulfilled, because none of the current sellers are selling for that price (the lowest price of BSE right now is 1510)


[06-Apr-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I am under the financial overview


[06-Apr-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	which key figures is how much cis I currently have on hand.


[06-Apr-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	honestly, the Financial Overview page is a big mess and i almost never look at it


[06-Apr-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	tell me about it.


[06-Apr-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	I see result that is in green so I am guessing that is how much I have on hand


[06-Apr-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you want to see your cash balances, either click the "SDBR" button in the top-left side bar, or open a buffer with the FINLA command


[06-Apr-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok I see it now.


[06-Apr-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	can I collect any of the materials that has been produced or I have to wait until it is completed?


[06-Apr-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you have to wait until it's completed


[06-Apr-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	ok. well I placed an order for some BSE so I can build me a collector.


[06-Apr-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mechwing**:	how do I find my transaction history if there is one.


[06-Apr-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the "FIN" command will show you your recent financial transactions.


[06-Apr-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you want to look at your recent commodity exchange orders/trades, you can use the CXOS command

**Johiah**:	got an npc faction contract


[16-Apr-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	when you get a faction contract that's like "provision X units of ABC at Umbra", your first move is to see if you can buy the stuff from the CX for less than what the faction is offering


[16-Apr-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and then consider your flight plans.  if the contract is to deliver the stuff to a planet that you're going to visit for weeks, then it's probably best to just skip that contract

**HotWings**:	Hey all, any tips for a newbie?


[08-Jun-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Welcome.  The game can be a lot when you start, but the tutorials and tutorial videos are pretty good.  Discord is a good community and place to get help.


[08-Jun-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	The other big tip would be to not be afraid to COLIQ (restart) if you feel like you didn't get off to the best start.

**EyangKodok**:	Getting your first PRO LIC is a great way to "properly" play ProUn because of the acess that it give (directly trade with other players) and a way to keep you playing with Sunk Cost Fallacy! Here let me help :D


[09-Jun-24 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	Joke aside.. (or is it? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ), getting PRO from other player (the one that doesn't give you BASIC) really help you getting proper feel of the game to see if it's for you, and lastly i highly suggest you to read the Handbook as i thinkk this is the best tutorial that you can get https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/

[20-Jun-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Askehalen**:	Looks like its a nice and slow, high patience game :D


[20-Jun-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	i wouldn't call it high patience game as it implies that you actively wait for things to happen, but in a way perhaps


[20-Jun-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Askehalen**:	Valid.


[20-Jun-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Askehalen**:	my first work order is 17 hrs, so not a lot will happen for a while.


[20-Jun-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	but ill call this game as High Planning? game


[20-Jun-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Askehalen**:	my worst attribute xD


[20-Jun-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	thats the thing! this game is excel at planning stuff, but how can you plan stuff if you're barely getby. To plan you need to have finace leaways in form of monetary funds! you can get "new player boost" from that one big corp for free! but the catch is you need PRO LIC :3


[20-Jun-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Askehalen**:	I'll figure it out eventually - maybe. I always just wing things, so we'll see how fast I crash this planet xD


[20-Jun-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Askehalen**:	I hope so. I was initially looking for a player economy merchant game, but this seems just as well


[20-Jun-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Askehalen**:	does drinking water and basic rations get consumed over time, I didn't spot anything about that

**EyangKodok**:	i think a corp with ship building able to make it if they really want to but it really is a niche item with niche uses thus not many if any build it


[23-Jun-24 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Basically that is the case, it would be a temp production to outfit your own ships and that'd be it.


[23-Jun-24 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Another aspect of it too is that, so far the peripherals for ships aren't really worth the effort of doing. Like with the hull plates. LHP is the best because of weight reduction and ease of ability to manufacture. The more advanced stuff doesn't provide enough benefits to warrant.

**Spaghett**:	I'm fairly new (a couple weeks in), and I chose Umbra as my starter planet. I have 2x EXT for MGS, 2x BMP to refine to MG and sometimes make PE, and I'm about to build an 1x COL for H and 1x INC to make my own C. Anyo e have any recommendations for which direction I should focus my efforts? I've been using Prunner to base plan, but I still kind of just feel aimless right now.

**Ravick**:	For motivational purposes, you may want to choose to focus on a particular speciality and build that out.  A lot of people ask for guidance on what the best thing to produce is, but most things work over time.  It's a sandbox game so you have to make your own motivation a bit.  Also, you might consider joining a corp.


[11-Jul-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spaghett**:	I appreciate the response. It makes sense to focus Chemistry here due to the bonus. I am interested in joining a corp, but I wasn't sure where to look.


[11-Jul-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Check out the properous universe discord, and find the UFO channel, which is for recruiting


[11-Jul-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spaghett**:	Thanks!


[11-Jul-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Something else to bear in mind; the H deposits here on Umbra aren't that good when compared to, say, CB-282d. Most people therefore prefer to just import H from the CX and use the newly freed-up space for more profitable buildings, like POLs.


[11-Jul-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spaghett**:	I appreciate that. In that case, when I am able to build POLs down the line, I'll definitely consider demolishing the COL.


[11-Jul-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Not saying that you shouldn't source your own imports at all, but as it stands you would have your buildings spread out over several industries. Resource extraction (COLs and/or INCs), manufacturing (BMPs)... It's usually considered more profitable to lean into what the planet's CoGC already specialises in. For Umbra, that would be chemistry.


[11-Jul-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	What's fun for one person might not be for another, but you can't really go wrong with producing PG or EPO (both made at a POL).


[11-Jul-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	*sorry, meant to say your own inputs instead of imports


[11-Jul-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	also, you can totally build H collectors today and in a month (when you have some more permits) deconstruct them on umbra and build an additional base somewhere else

**eminence32**:	nothing is ever set in stone


[11-Jul-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(i've been playing this game for over a year and i still have my "starter" collectors on umbra)


[11-Jul-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZenWhisper**:	You could eventually end up importing H from an H base 13 jumps away in Harpina using spare volume in ships carrying denser goods back and forth.  It is interesting to see what solutions end up making sense.


[11-Jul-24 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spaghett**:	I appreciate all the input, fellas! Looking forward to seeing how things pan out.

[14-Jul-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	you could try making MG witht the BMPs instead, you might be able to buy the inputs and sell the outputs right here on planet


[14-Jul-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	a large number of bases here on Umbra are making PG, since the planet has MGS. Which is turned into MG at a BMP then PG at a POL.


[14-Jul-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'd buy MG here, if someone were to sell it.  i consume about 30 per day, and i'm a fairly small PG producer

[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jairus**:	My problem is ship capacity; I've been getting it from BEN but I can only take so much at a time. It's more the delivery to Umbra aspect that I want here :)


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	I can have 800 sio here in a day. It's on its way from Etherwind


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd offer you some shipping capacity between BEN/UV-351c, but the in-system rates are #dog-shit.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The intra-system shipping environment just tears through my hulls. If Umbra wasn't on a leading-edge orbit from the CX station, this would be no issue. However, it is, and ships going to/from have to burn more time/ ship condition just to get here.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But @Jainus you have pro -- you should have no issue purchasing from market, and issuing shipping conts of BEN --> Umbra for your needs.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm also not blaming your cont ppu rates. However, only such producers who are willing to drop-off at UV-351c will be supplying them (for whomever picks them up).


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	from your perspective, what would be a fair intra-system rate here?


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Fair? A skewed definition. If LM cont rates are below exchange rates, I think few should dare themselves into such things. IF LM rates are slightly above CX rates, then your producers will supply, especially if they can FTL themselves unto Umbra. If they are much above, but not too much, depending on who partakes in the ASK/BID offerings, then you should get a more willing amount of competitiors who want your business. That's my take.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i've always found shipping heavy-but-cheap stuff is hard.  if i pay 1000 CIS per 100 tons of SIO, then i'm paying 1000 CIS to move 4000 CIS worth of materials, which is a huge percentage


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Per 500 t/m3, both sets of their LM contracts profer 1.1k in net advances, above current BEN CX rates. So they'll be looking at bulk exporters who have FTL capabilities. Sheer STL rates between BEN <--> Umbra run for like 3k per 500t/m3, or something, since as I said before, this system is harsh to operate in.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Heavy but cheap? Sure. However you're putting yourself at a net disadvantage, if you export your ores/minerals en masse. Consider this....


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Instead of using a WCB FTL to export/import ores, I could use it to export/import RATS (since they have a particular t/m3 ratio).


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you BID low, and ASK high... From say HRT, to BEN, with just RATs via a WCB ship, you'll be netting ~286k in profits from such a shipment.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(to be clear, i am not in the shipping business myself)


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm not exactly in it, but your ROI determinations, from say your base designs, should be applied to shipping stuff for other people as well.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Else, you are doing their work, on the cheap.


[31-Jul-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you are picking up extra work, for places that you are travelling to, sure you're picking up extra ROI/revenues. But if not, I'd say you have better options.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i am, however, increasingly interested in hiring ships because my current fleet of 2 ships is starting to become inadequate.  and so the question of "how do i price my LM adverts" is something i'm starting to think about more


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm not familiar with the BEN periphery.... However.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can price/segment our your shipments in 500 or 250 t/m3 parcels, discrete (no 250.1 t/m3 or anything like that). People should pick your stuff up, better than your competition, should you put up higher prices than the others.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	LCB/WCB ships come in and out, so you'll probably see uptake of 1k m3, or 2k m3, depending on what you want shipped. They also come in intervals, about x2 weekly, since that's what ships doing local FTL jobs can do, approximately weekly. If it's inter-CX jobs, then you're looking at more hang-time.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	As per your own stuff. It seems like you do a mix of things.... You've probably upgraded your own starters at this point. The only advice I can give is to fund some future capital expentidures for more ships, since you'll need em.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	indeed, both ships are upgraded.  one is a 3/1 and the other is a 1/1


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Your 1k can go into either a WCB, or a LCB, off-base. If you'll maintain pro, you should look into buying new WCB/VCB/LCB ships for you needs, though.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, i am going to be funding a new ship in the near future.  2 is just not enough right now


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	lol.. there are never enough ships!! :P


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you run your LM ads via the CX, you'll get more takers.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's more visibility there, than at a planet's LM.

[02-Sep-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Plots become available again as people leave, COLIQ or go inactive for long enough.


[02-Sep-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	If a planet is only full by a full plots, you can usually wait a few days. If we're talking hundreds of plots over full, like how Promitor is, you're better of picking a different planet. Or start over, because one's starter base can be built wherever you'd like.


[02-Sep-24 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	*only full by a few plots

**etareduction**:	Is it possible to directly transfer money?


[05-Sep-24 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	No but you can send a contract for 1 rat, pay someone and then terminate the contract


[05-Sep-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**etareduction**:	And what happens when the contract is terminated? Is there any penalties for that?


[05-Sep-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	Not if both parties terminate.


[05-Sep-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**etareduction**:	Can we just do a loan contract and terminate it the same way?


[05-Sep-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**etareduction**:	I guess it works the same and no difference


[05-Sep-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aahz**:	sure, whatever is easier for you.


[05-Sep-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@Targetify we all go through the tutorials first. It's a great way to learn your first steps here.


[06-Sep-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	alright


[06-Sep-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	after you watch the tutorials, feel free to ask any questions, we're happy to help


[06-Sep-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	this game takes quite a bit of effort to get going


[06-Sep-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	The learning curve is a bit steep at first, yes...


[06-Sep-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	if this is your type of game, tho, it will be rewarding


[06-Sep-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	can I still do a contract that has a closed status?


[06-Sep-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Closed contract here means "accepted contract"


[06-Sep-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	oh okay


[06-Sep-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	thanks


[06-Sep-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	o7


[06-Sep-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	how do I get more contracts?


[06-Sep-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	As a new account, you will be getting 3 faction contracts to choose 1 from every 16 hours. As times passes this frequency increases until you get 3 every 24 hrs or so


[06-Sep-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Ideally you will be working on your base, constructing buildings to produce products to sell.


[06-Sep-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	so do I have nothing to do as a manufacturer?


[06-Sep-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	I've built two habitats


[06-Sep-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	and two basic materials plants


[06-Sep-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	This is covered in the tutorial about the profession you chose.


[06-Sep-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	You will use the materials plant to produce products.


[06-Sep-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	take these products to the market using your ships


[06-Sep-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	and sell them to profit and expand your base


[06-Sep-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	if you ever make a mistake at this point, or believe you chose something wrong, you can always restart using the command "COLIQ"  in a new buffer.


[06-Sep-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	alright thanks


[06-Sep-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Sure, anytime. o7


[06-Sep-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	is the time it says it'll take for a production queue


[06-Sep-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	real time?


[06-Sep-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but even with a mistake, it's likely possible to recover, so please do ask first.  we might have some ideas for things you can try before a company liquidation


[06-Sep-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	yes


[06-Sep-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	so I'll have to wait a whole day for this production order


[06-Sep-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep


[06-Sep-24 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	this feels a bit more like work and not a game


[06-Sep-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it can be slow at the start.


[06-Sep-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	heck, it can be slow even after you've been playing for a year.  sometimes i have nothing to do except wait 24 hours for my ship to arrive somewhere


[06-Sep-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	so im expected to queue these production orders up


[06-Sep-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	and then come back hours later?


[06-Sep-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep :)


[06-Sep-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	why is it this way


[06-Sep-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	later on things go faster because you'll have multiple production lines, or more bases (each with their own production lines)


[06-Sep-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	in the mean time


[06-Sep-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	you can plan your expansion, check the market, check the community, theres a lot to do besides waiting


[06-Sep-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	it is a slow game, sure. :)


[06-Sep-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	more like work


[06-Sep-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i dunno


[06-Sep-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	are you normally doing nothing for hours at a time at work?


[06-Sep-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	:)


[06-Sep-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Targetify**:	no I just normally play games to have fun


[06-Sep-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so do the rest of us


[06-Sep-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this is a game about making stuff and buying and selling in a market with several hundred other people, and we think it's fun


[06-Sep-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the game is free for as long as you want, so i'd encourage you to check in on the game once a day or whatever best suits you, in order to figure out if it's your type/style of game


[06-Sep-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	It's totally understandable that this game doesn't please everyone. It's a very specific type of game.


[06-Sep-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Papi2Caca**:	It's a different pace. It's not  agame you sit down and beat in a few days. You come back and play it for months, or years.

[09-Sep-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	@waffleshark, I would recomend looking into items CHEM items. The plants CoGC is chemistry. If produce items in that category you get a 25% efficiency bonus.


[06-Oct-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	And with the price of PE.CI1 right now the profit margins are slim.

**eminence32**:	COGC stands for “Chamber for Global Commerce.  Every week, each player with a PRO license and a base on the planet can vote for a certain industry to receive a 25% production bonus.


[07-Oct-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptColeslaw**:	prunner (the desktop app most people used to use) has been mostly replaced by PRUNplanner (browser based, developed by Scorpio and has way more features). Prunner is out of date now though, so I don't think there's a current and public desktop app for base planning anymore


[07-Oct-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	anyone happen to have 6 TRU on hand?


[09-Oct-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Not on Umbra. But have some on Katoa.


[09-Oct-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	same, but since i am a potato, i flew from katoa to umbra without the necessary TRU


[09-Oct-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ah I see.


[09-Oct-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I wouldn't be surprised though if someone did have a couple TRUs lying around.


[09-Oct-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this is not the first time i've left the TRU at home


[09-Oct-24 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i should just stash like 100 units at every base


[09-Oct-24 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Haha. What do you need them for? Repairs?


[09-Oct-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	thats interesting. everytime i forgot something, it was TRU.


[09-Oct-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	im going to do the same, stash everywhere lol


[09-Oct-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm just used to buying more than the BRA says I should


[09-Oct-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Even though it has the 24 hour and 48 hour feature now


[09-Oct-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Stashing everywhere isn't a bad strategy


[09-Oct-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I made a tool that calculates repair costs for a planet and just adds 10% to verything.


[09-Oct-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	haha nice


[09-Oct-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I typically just add a few when I buy for repairs


[09-Oct-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. That was my initial approach, but if you have a base full of EXTs for instance and you need 300 BSEs for repairs, adding 3 or 4 might not be enough if it ticks up before you get there.


[09-Oct-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Anything extra gets shipped back to the nearest station and saved for the next repair


[09-Oct-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's why I went with percentages.


[09-Oct-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Oh, definitely


[09-Oct-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	interesting


[09-Oct-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Im starting to accumulate 60days repair bills on warehouses before the 60d arises.


[09-Oct-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	BRA for Boucher is saying 159 BSE right now


[09-Oct-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	For example


[09-Oct-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I typically shoot for 45 day repair periods at most


[09-Oct-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	But I'm going over that in a few places lately


[09-Oct-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Honestly, fabs tend to weigh so little, I'd imagine if you have a ship free, just bring in a batch of repair fabs and set a ate on the calendar haha.


[09-Oct-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	90% is my cutoff.


[09-Oct-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It isn't that bad until you have 22 bases


[09-Oct-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	true


[09-Oct-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I have 9 and am suffering


[09-Oct-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I've never got to 80%


[09-Oct-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Or 90%


[09-Oct-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	possible idea for future business venture:  a repair truck that's loaded up with all the usual repair materials and can make house calls ;)


[09-Oct-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	That is a solid business idea


[09-Oct-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Honestly, at this point I'd definitely be willing to pay for somebody to do regular repair runs


[09-Oct-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I manage repairs for my corp in BEN/ANT space. My tool helps me figure out how much we need for the entire planet, stock up on a couple planets worth and start making the rounds.


[09-Oct-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's not that bad. Especially since repairs only come around every month or two.


[09-Oct-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Uuuuh, that is a really good idea. I gurantee there would be takers.


[09-Oct-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Clientele would be the... wealthier population willing to pay a premium for not having to deal with it haha.


[09-Oct-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'd really rather not deal with it at this point


[09-Oct-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	someone extra clever could be like:  "give your FIO key to my bot and it will show up at your door with contracts whenever we detect repairs are needed"


[09-Oct-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I could definitely do something like that. Join a FIO group for a monthly subscription and have fabs delivered whenever repairs come up.


[09-Oct-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Only thing is, most larger players already have fab production and such up and running. And if you don't they'd end up paying a lot more to source them from you paying market prices than using their own fabs.


[09-Oct-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I think I single-handedly messed up the CL market in BEN here the other night


[09-Oct-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Had to re-supply Umbra


[09-Oct-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Lol. You definitely did something.


[09-Oct-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	50% price increases are frowned upon.


[09-Oct-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Oh well


[09-Oct-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I can't afford downtime


[09-Oct-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Nah it's fine. MOR market has a very solid CL market.


[09-Oct-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	People can go out there to resupply if they need to.


[09-Oct-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i've got 6 CHPs dedicated to making the stuff


[09-Oct-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Can never have enough CL.


[09-Oct-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Honestly, if it were me, I'd try to team up with someone to build 2 bases on Griffonstone, one with EXTs and the other with CHPs. Make use of those experts. Split the CL.


[09-Oct-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I burn ~90/day


[09-Oct-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Holy beanz


[09-Oct-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's insane.


[09-Oct-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And CL isn't super easy to transport either. That stuff is heavy.


[09-Oct-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Nah


[09-Oct-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	My supplier is on Circe so I buy local in BEN


[09-Oct-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Circe supplies my base on Circe and OT-889c


[09-Oct-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I buy in BEN for my Umbra base


[09-Oct-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's fair. It's a bit of a trek out there.


[09-Oct-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it's also very interesting to me that NA and CL have such different prices


[09-Oct-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I've got enough ships now that I could manage it all if I was efficient about it


[09-Oct-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And we need more CL producers in the area as well. Some great Chem planets around here. I'm sure there are tons of POLs in need of more CL.


[09-Oct-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	NA is a useless byproduct.


[09-Oct-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	NA is just a byproduct


[09-Oct-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Nowhere near as much demand


[09-Oct-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Barely used. And can't get around producing it. CL is in high demand, thus you end up with tons of spare NA.


[09-Oct-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(in fact, it's kinda hard to imagine more different prices)


[09-Oct-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	The GL market isn't bad right now, but most people are just looking to get rid of NA


[09-Oct-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	That's why they added the MM


[09-Oct-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	yeah, cover hauling costs :P


[09-Oct-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Exactly


[09-Oct-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Pretty much. Although I could see people building INS bases to try and use some of it making their own THF. Although really how much THF do you really need.


[09-Oct-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You're not gonna compete with PiBoy on INS


[09-Oct-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i make some INS, so i go through about 30 THF per day


[09-Oct-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	On a side note. I really like the idea of making BDEs and INS on Gibson, and the heavy AL consumers like LFabs and some BFabs on Nike where you have AL planets everywhere you look.


[09-Oct-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Hah. I've been selling Piboy 100k PE a week to feed his INS addiction.


[09-Oct-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Call it an addiction


[09-Oct-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	/me checks LEAD


[09-Oct-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	haha


[09-Oct-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	holy heck


[09-Oct-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	That's one of the most genius business lines there is


[09-Oct-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	HE's the dealer


[09-Oct-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	He's opened plenty of worlds to development that previously were glanced over


[09-Oct-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	true


[09-Oct-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Especially in BEN, most of the best planets are locked behind INS requirements.


[09-Oct-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And you need about 5k a base.


[09-Oct-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It used to cost much more


[09-Oct-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Bringing down costs on mats like that has a much bigger effect than one would think


[09-Oct-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	i agree


[09-Oct-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. It still costs a pretty penny though to get enough for a full base. But it could be a million times worse.


[09-Oct-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	INS alone is about 25% the whole cost of a base


[09-Oct-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Depends on the base. But it can be as much as 50% even.


[09-Oct-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You should've seen what it was before


[09-Oct-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	The current prices make a lot more places profitable


[09-Oct-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well don't keep me in suspense. It's always been around 140 or so during my time, at least that I've noticed anyways.


[09-Oct-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I mean, the cool thing about INS is that it's super cheap to produce if you make all your own inputs.


[09-Oct-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Honestly, I don't even remember the prices on INS from back when I started off of the top of my head


[09-Oct-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I just remember it being high enough that it was a bit of a kneecap


[09-Oct-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	according to prunplanner, INS.CI saw peaks of 700 per unit in march of 2023


[09-Oct-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	That sounds about right


[09-Oct-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Holy crap


[09-Oct-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, no kidding. Makes any INS planet completely unattainable unless you make your own INS.


[09-Oct-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	any of you need anything delivered to katoa?  leaving here soon with 500t free


[09-Oct-24 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Nah my Umbra base just went up this morning. Haven't even produced a single thing yet.


[09-Oct-24 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ahh, didn't even realize you're new here


[09-Oct-24 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	since you're in like every other local chat i'm in


[09-Oct-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah haha. I'm an Umbra greenie.


[09-Oct-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Making PG, EPO out of POLs, and THF, TCL, and DDT out of a couple LABs.


[09-Oct-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm incidentally making INS out on Gibson haha. Not much, but my 2 PP3s out there get the job done.


[09-Oct-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Good deal


[09-Oct-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm running PG and EPO here on Umbra


[09-Oct-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Are you producing KV?


[09-Oct-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the KV gets made back on katoa


[09-Oct-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. That's the plan. Corp needs some for AFabs and RFabs.


[09-Oct-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Nice


[09-Oct-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I was in A-fabs but I scaled back to R and L-fabs


[09-Oct-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	A-fabs just doesn't seem profitable enough for the trouble


[09-Oct-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	don't*


[09-Oct-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Although I'm not really producing enough TCL to make all that many. Especially those 3 LABs are split trying to supply 3 separate bases haha.


[09-Oct-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We don't produce them to sell them.


[09-Oct-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We use them.


[09-Oct-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you need some TCL i can sell you some excess


[09-Oct-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Even so I found it more worthwhile to buy them


[09-Oct-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	To each their own


[09-Oct-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I had way too many bases tied up in A-fabs


[09-Oct-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. Could be better to buy them. But given I don't make any money as I don't sell anything on the CX, that'll be hard to do haha.


[09-Oct-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Oh you were talking about the AFabs


[09-Oct-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Aye


[09-Oct-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah that I see for sure. Too many RFab inputs. The chem inputs are easy(ish) enough.. The KV cost is kind of brutal for ADEs I believe is the one that needs them. And you can't really produce more than a handful a day. Really though, if you want to get past lvl30, there aren't enough Afabs on the CX to buy them haha.


[09-Oct-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Not that I envy people with that many bases. Can you imagine the frickin upkeep?


[09-Oct-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	R-fabs are easy


[09-Oct-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Rfabs are simple, but not easy. You need so much EPO. And for the EPO, you need tons of CL.


[09-Oct-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You need like half a dozen bases just to feed a single PP3 base making RFabs.


[09-Oct-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	That's where my ~90 CL/day comes inot count


[09-Oct-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I produce ~30K EPO/wk


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	phew, that's a lotta EPO


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Run the numbers on ADE


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Between the LDE and KV


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Not worth it


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	That's very solid. Must be like 2 EPO bases.


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no, i don't think i will run the numbers.  A-fabs scare me ;)


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Good man


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Do you buy your HAL off the CX? Or have local suppliers?


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I have a CL guy


[09-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Ah okay, even better


[09-Oct-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Oh right, on Circe I believe you said.


[09-Oct-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Believe it or not, I don't produce any CL


[09-Oct-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I buy it all


[09-Oct-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well, when you're producing RFabs, you don't need it. Margins are so good.


[09-Oct-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And will you look at that. 60 THF just rolled off the production line. First products out of Umbra.


[09-Oct-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	\o/


[09-Oct-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Stick to R-fabs


[09-Oct-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. I mean it may even be better to produce RFabs, sell them and buy AFabs with them. Make more money like that.


[09-Oct-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Still need AFab producers to actually put any on the CX though.


[09-Oct-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And from what I can tell, you don't really need many AFabs for bases themselves. It's really just for HQ upgrades.


[09-Oct-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	The quantities you need later down the line is just total insanity.


[09-Oct-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	sometimes i open https://pct.fnar.net/hq/ and just gawk

**SilentReaper**:	Haha. I have it open now because I recently got all the materials I need to get myself up to LVL19.


[09-Oct-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Gone are the days where LFabs and RFabs were the only things you needed (plus the weird stuff) to upgrade my HQ.


[09-Oct-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Just depends on what you want to build


[09-Oct-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Nice!


[09-Oct-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm working on HQ 24


[09-Oct-24 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Well godspeed. I doubt I'll get past lvl 21 anytime soon.


[09-Oct-24 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	We don't produce all that many AFabs to throw them around for one HQ upgrade.


[09-Oct-24 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It's a bitch


[09-Oct-24 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-24 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I upgraded my HQ to lvl 18, 19 permits... Im only using 14 yet. Need to increase my fleet before expanding more :(


[09-Oct-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	after 18 costs become a bigger issue


[09-Oct-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. You get into those AFabs. Although the quantity is still relatively reasonable.

[10-Oct-24 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm not sure exactly how profitable selling PG is at the moment.  but if you consume a lot of PG, making it yourself on umbra can be smart


[10-Oct-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	Its not aweful, but not the best. If you can affrod the inputs, EPO is better at the moment.

**superbadsounds**:	Any one happen to have a spare BMF on planet by chance? Was goona do a HQ upgrade, but there are none at the CX


[13-Oct-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i can make one for you at katoa, but it'll take a few days get the input materials


[13-Oct-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**superbadsounds**:	I think I should be able to source it without you having to go to that level of trouble, but if I can't, I will let you know!


[13-Oct-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ok.  it's not that much trouble, i just need 1 MB at katoa (but i just left benten station before seeing your message, and i probably won't be back there for another 24 hours or so)


[13-Oct-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	hey if anyone needs plastics at a reasonable price, unlike the ones at the cx, i can source them to the cx


[13-Oct-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	some of the prices there are stupid high but i only need a little profit so long as soemone buys them


[13-Oct-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have lots of MB on Katoa if you want eminence to build a BMF for you. It will be a day before I have a BMF made though it is already queued.


[13-Oct-24 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	sounds like @BlueHeeler can get one made before me, so @superbadsounds if you want to get your BMF from BlueHeeler, go right ahead

**erunamo**:	Engineer population has been dropping.  However, the last population report shows no jobs are open.  Did you just build something requiring Engineers?  Sometimes you have to wait for the next population report


[18-Oct-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	open jobs are from before POPR


[18-Oct-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	as of now there are roughly 100 open ENG jobs


[18-Oct-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	assuming no one built or demolished anything


[18-Oct-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, all the popi infrastructure buildings are barely fed. Same on Katoa. KAWA is dropping the ball on their government offices.

[18-Oct-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anpache**:	The governor of Umbra lost near everything in a hurricane. A few of us are trying to divert resources to cover


[18-Oct-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Oh shoot.


[18-Oct-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm really sorry to hear that.


[18-Oct-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Hope he's alright. Milton was an absolute beast. I narrowly escaped it actually. I live in Gainesville FL, just north of where the hurricane hit. It was originally set to come through here, but diverted a little further south.


[18-Oct-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I didn't build anything - the engineers just emmigrated with the lastpopulation update. I'm sorry he was affected in a hurricane though! I feel bad for complaining about a silly game in comparison.

[19-Oct-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Braino_11**:	How do I play?


[19-Oct-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Braino_11**:	I made a rig but now I can't make anything


[19-Oct-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Braino_11**:	I don't have the resources for the air thing


[19-Oct-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Braino_11**:	Do you know how I could try to restart or something?


[19-Oct-24 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	There is an option to restart.


[19-Oct-24 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But I would spend some time trying to figure things out first.


[19-Oct-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Want to make sure you have a plan before heading back in again. You can only restart once before having to wait a week I believe it is before you can restart again.


[19-Oct-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And then it's longer the next time.


[19-Oct-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And you can demolish your building within the first 3 hours without losing any materials.


[19-Oct-24 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	So you can demolish your rig if you wanted to build something else in stead.


[19-Oct-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	@Bast it's a very interesting question actually, "in a player supplied & player consumed, economic markets sim..what things actually INJECT new items/cash into the game (inflation??) / what things REMOVE or BURN existing items/cash forever (deflation??)?"


[25-Oct-24 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	there are some obvious/highly visible answers to that (there are fees in some parts...also cancelled jobs make some stuff disappear forever)


[25-Oct-24 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	maintaining a workforce and all that


[25-Oct-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	a non-obvious one I noticed was the NPC Buyer/Seller in the Commodity Exchanges. I guess you could burn cash forever by selling low/buying high to those COs


[25-Oct-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	ex: the Benten Station exchange -> Order book for Drinking Water [DW] `CXOB DW.CI1` -> "Castillo-Ito Mercantile Market Maker"


[25-Oct-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	oops, I meant the command would be: CXOB DW . CI1  (remove spaces)


[25-Oct-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	in practice, i dont' think the market makers are a big value sink.  the vast majority of trading happens between players


[25-Oct-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	consumables and upkeep account for nearly all the value sinks


[25-Oct-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah, I think that's right ^^


[25-Oct-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And cash get's injected via things like IDC bases and such.


[25-Oct-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, that's a direct cash injection via MM.  but most of the value gets injected into the system through resource extraction

**Crate**:	what should i craft with some poly ethilene as manufacturer guys whats a reccomendation


[26-Oct-24 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	get a prefab blanfd and make bde


[26-Oct-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	*prefab plant


[26-Oct-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	@Crate ^ that's what I've been doing since I started on this planet. Making PE and MCG @ my BMPs -> use some for Construction, sell some at the Exchange in Benten Station -> use leftover to construct BDE in Prefab Plants (PP1) because it only needs PE .. or other stuff, if you can manage to buy&ship materials and still make money back


[26-Oct-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Leibowitz**:	not saying it's the most optimal or profitable, but it works and it feels like the "path of least resistance" way to do it so far

**Sgt.Skeleton**:	why?


[09-Nov-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**masonwater**:	wassnt asking you to do what you cannot, its probable the govener is just letting it slip

**Sgt.Skeleton**:	the issue is, without that chem bonus umbra sucks


[09-Nov-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	It's been filled for now, so let's just give it a day or two and figure out why it was let slide. Sometimes mistakes happen.

**Sgt.Skeleton**:	ill wait on it, its just cos popi has been a bit iffy over here recently


[10-Nov-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Governor had something IRL that pulled him away a few days ago. I'll let you know when I hear more. But for now, I think we can just assume it was unavoidable circumstances.

**WishDragon**:	so starting out, there's not really much to do but wait yea?


[05-Jan-25 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	game still worth playing or is it dead? hard to guess considering people may be on browser instead of steam


[05-Jan-25 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	hi, welcome!


[05-Jan-25 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	game is not dead at all.   at the bottom-right of the browser version (not mobile version), you can see there are 265 people logged in at the moment


[05-Jan-25 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and yeah, when you're just getting started, the game is a little slow.  things run in real-time ,so when your production line says "done in 12 hours", you'll have to wait 12 actual hours


[05-Jan-25 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	265 pople isn't really a lot


[05-Jan-25 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	and yea the real time waiting is not lost on me lol


[05-Jan-25 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	didn't know if there were micro optimizations I could do in the meantime or I really just have nothing to do for the entire duration of waiting


[05-Jan-25 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, 265 isn't a huge number.  but that's just people actively connected (and some people only log in once a day to check on things)


[05-Jan-25 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for a new company, there's no much for you to do in-game.   but people often spend idle time planning for their next steps, or chatting with people in-game.   later on, if you get more bases, there's more to do


[05-Jan-25 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	yea makes sense


[05-Jan-25 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	I tried starting a few months back, wasn't really feeling it, but I think having it as a passive background thing might be quite nice


[05-Jan-25 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, having the right mindset helps.


[05-Jan-25 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	I do really want a game like this I can be a little more "proactive" in though. A more factorio-esc game or one with more direct gameplay


[05-Jan-25 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	eve online doesn't count cause that game sucks and is massively subscription based


[05-Jan-25 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	what do you have in mind by "proactive" or "direct gameplay" ?


[05-Jan-25 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this game could sort of be that, i think


[05-Jan-25 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for example, if you wanted to go deep into the trading aspect of the game, you could actively be hunting for good deals, analyzing the markets, trying to predict upcoming supply or deman


[05-Jan-25 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	uhh


[05-Jan-25 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	like


[05-Jan-25 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	proactive in the sense there's more to "immerse" myself in. This is very much an economy sim. But in the more factory game sense there would be a layer of physical automation and design like how you bases look or work on a more direct level. Or in a more "gamey" sense something like Star citizen where you have a first person simulation game layered over an economy sim (eventually)


[05-Jan-25 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	either way, there's more to "do" in a hands on sense, here it's pure management, which I don't mind but means it can be very slow at times


[05-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ok, i think i see what you mean.  i don't think you'll find that here


[05-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	yea no, definitely not, sadly no game gets close to that lmao


[05-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but maybe you can do what i do, which is keep prosperous universe on one screen and play satisfactory on the other :)


[05-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	so I gotta spread the autism between a bunch of different ones


[05-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	yea


[05-Jan-25 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	I never liked satisfactory much, but I am very into factorio and simlar games


[05-Jan-25 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	tbh once star citizen implements base building I think I'll be spending a hell of a lot more time there


[05-Jan-25 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	a few months ago it had its 1.0 release, so me and some friends have been having fun in it


[05-Jan-25 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	Yea I was playing a bunch then too


[05-Jan-25 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	I just find scaling up in SF a chore because of how trains work


[05-Jan-25 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	way too limited


[05-Jan-25 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	oh yeah, we're learning that trains in satisfactory are very half-baked


[05-Jan-25 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WishDragon**:	you get like, 2 ways of controlling them, and they break super easily if you try to do anything more complex


[05-Jan-25 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-25 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Well. gemma2:2b and I both missed the reference to 'satisfactory' - I had to look it up. However, gemma2:2b did much better at parsing the intended message than I did. "The person is describing a challenging task that they are struggling with, likely in a way that is both incredibly frustrating and  humorous.  They feel stuck and hopeless, but use humor to express their experience". So, I would just say that my response was intended as humor and not meant to be rude.e

[18-Jan-25 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Psycho_00**:	MTP definition : "The days of industrial livestock farming have long gone by, and the term "meat" has since taken on another meaning merely pertaining to a meal's texture and taste." There is no such thing as animal meat no more

**Roh**:	Through all the maths in this game, you're actually have incentive to learn everything that you can actually do, + talk with people. It's a very long-term game, and it's also a sandbox. There's very little margin for failure, unless you don't learn the fundamentals that are pushed in the tutorials and whatnot. :P

**Sgt.Skeleton**:	nah margins arent that tight


[22-Jan-25 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	ive eyeballed most things in this game


[22-Jan-25 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	suire its slow to expand when doing so


[22-Jan-25 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	but its easiest and least time consuming for me and thats what i like


[22-Jan-25 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i agree that margins aren't that tight.  in fact, unless you do something very silly like get your ship stuck without fuel, or not provide basic consumables to your workers, you probably won't lose money when making common stuff


[22-Jan-25 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Though remember you have production costs! I forgot about those at the start and had to coliq due to no money

**isherwood**:	Does anyone know or have an idea why BEN demand for LAB products is so low/non-existent?


[06-Feb-25 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**The_Stinker**:	probably because they just source it themselves. the mats are primarily used for workforce upkeep, which can only be done by pro players. Your best bet would be making TCL for KV


[06-Feb-25 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	As already mentioned, TCL should do pretty well. As would DDT and THF.


[06-Feb-25 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i personally run LABs just for my own use, so all of my LAB products get consumed directly


[06-Feb-25 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(so i don't really buy or sell their products on the CX, except when i have a little excess)


[06-Feb-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**isherwood**:	What's interesting is that LAB products do sell on ANT.


[06-Feb-25 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Feb-25 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Hey there and welcome. On some planets you'd be able to dig up iron ore and smelt it in a smelter, but this planet doesn't have any iron ore. Your best bet would probably be to buy it off the nearby Commodity Exchange (CX).


[07-Feb-25 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

**jaymeson**:	Umbra is HQ for me. How can I help?


[03-Apr-25 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I think the issue is that ever time you guys get pop surplus you let them leave. Looking back through the poprs, you guys are great at bringing new pops in, but the moment you've filled all vacancies, you let TEC and ENG pops emigrate by the hundreds.


[03-Apr-25 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Perhaps just making sure the happiness stays above 50% would fix this.


[03-Apr-25 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	ENG pops on Umbra have been around 1700-2000 for months now. Just goes up and down.


[03-Apr-25 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	And you had 123 SCI at one point too, but happiness is just too low so they're leaving.


[03-Apr-25 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I guess I haven't been watching close enough....this isn't one of my planets to govern


[03-Apr-25 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Holy crap....the INF has all 3 mats in it....ok, I need to get more involved with day-to-day things here


[03-Apr-25 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah. I mean it's not a bad strategy to build up a ton of TEC pops and use SET immigration to do it. You have enough TEC that you could make it the basis of your higher tier pop growth. But with 23% unemployment, I don't know if the INF should be that FED lol.


[03-Apr-25 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Taking away need fulfillment from other pops.


[03-Apr-25 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jaymeson**:	I plan to expand +70 TEC v soon


[03-Apr-25 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	we're putting together a parts list for strategic building upgrades now, until then we're just kinda gonna overfill things and stop the bleeding. We've got a plan in motion though, it'll take some weeks but we'll have it stabilized asap


[03-Apr-25 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	buildings are over the cap so not much help. as Cpt said, we will get some buildings in here and give more flexibility


[03-Apr-25 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Festival 3 just keeps things almost normal so there isn't room to run other programs...until we get buildings in here


[03-Apr-25 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Yeah


[03-Apr-25 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I'm honestly surprised you guys have survived with the infrastructure the planet does have for so long.


[03-Apr-25 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Sorry all, I thought things were closer to good, but now we will push hard to get POP increased and stabilized


[03-Apr-25 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	You're good.


[03-Apr-25 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Yeah, I didn't realize the buildings were limiting it so much...fixes on the way :)


[03-Apr-25 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I have all the pops I need lol.


[03-Apr-25 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Apr-25 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the only real benefit is:  if you build a corp HQ on a non-faction planet, you get a bonus to production on that planet (10% if i recall correctly)


[22-Apr-25 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	there can be a lot of fun and benefits in the social side of it. but yeah, mechanically, that's it, just 10% bonus on a single plane after you build an HQ


[22-Apr-25 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	and depending on the planet you're interested in, there are some corps open to the public that exist just for anyone to get that +10%, like Etherwind
