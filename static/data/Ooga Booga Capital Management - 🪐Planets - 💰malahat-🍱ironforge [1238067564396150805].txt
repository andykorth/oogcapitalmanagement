Do I look okay in this Malahat?  I'm thinking I should go with a bowler or a beret.  What do y'all think?

I kicked off engineer immigration last night. we are in such a weird situation


[09-May-24 11:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
We gained 278 engineers from education... then 279 engineers educated themselves into scientists


[09-May-24 11:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
so we net lost one engineer


[09-May-24 11:47 AM] churavis#0000
Everybody wants the good life


[09-May-24 11:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
despite the 81.9% -> 60% happiness between those tiers


[09-May-24 12:01 PM] allocater#0000
now I wonder what happiness percentages we need so that 30% education gives more than 50 ENG 🤔


[09-May-24 12:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I ran it the last two week,s you can check it out


[09-May-24 12:03 PM] katinga#0000
Engineers love problems to solve.  Install more escape rooms


[09-May-24 12:03 PM] allocater#0000
2.7% TEC became ENG
1.4% ENG became SCI


[09-May-24 12:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
instead of 278 it was ~500


[09-May-24 12:04 PM] allocater#0000
yeah for net -5


[09-May-24 12:04 PM] katinga#0000
I didn't realize a citizen class could evolve into another


[09-May-24 12:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
yep


[09-May-24 12:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
The "Rate" is actually higher for engineers than for scientists

[09-May-24 12:04 PM] katinga#0000
is it a level up evolution?  a stone evolution?  or do I need to turn my console upside down and then trade?


[09-May-24 12:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
We just need more people with technician buildings really


[09-May-24 12:05 PM] allocater#0000
we would need to get SCI to half of ENG, which might not be possible


[09-May-24 12:06 PM] allocater#0000
unless SCI drop below 50%


[09-May-24 12:06 PM] allocater#0000
which is also unlikely since people keep building IDC bases


[09-May-24 12:06 PM] katinga#0000
Oooo!  So I can take a settler on a walk for 10,000 steps and he'll learn to walk upright?!

"How many steps must a TE-EC go, before you can call him a ENG?" 🎵 😄


[09-May-24 12:07 PM] katinga#0000
I play way too much pokemon


[09-May-24 12:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, and there's no real way to pull down the happiness of scientists exclusively except by growing them until unemployment is even higher


[09-May-24 12:13 PM] melon164#0000
So basically there are _no_ levers the governor can pull to increase ENG?


[09-May-24 12:13 PM] melon164#0000
That might be worth a forum post if so, the devs might be interested


[09-May-24 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ehhh I think it's working as intended


[09-May-24 12:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Malahat is a weird edge case in a lot of ways


[09-May-24 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
In general, there's no way to grow a high tier population while avoiding low tier growth. I think the needs matrix was designed to make that happen on purpose. Especially the capping behavior. (Otherwise, I'd feed education and zero safety/health)


[09-May-24 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
The "too many scientists, not enough engineers" was probably unforeseen but wouldn't be surprising


[09-May-24 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since ostensibly the unemployment -> happiness math "fixes" that. I just don't want to solve it by having 40% unemployed scientists


[09-May-24 12:29 PM] allocater#0000
yeah we might have to convert all OOG EDC bases to IDC


[09-May-24 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
I hear more contracts in my future 😄


[09-May-24 01:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
I hear the return is a bit higher for IDC, right?


[09-May-24 02:06 PM] katinga#0000
IDC = I don't care, right? 🙂

[09-May-24 02:10 PM] katinga#0000
I am pretty sure Sidepipe is filling up those EDC with adult vids 😛


[09-May-24 02:13 PM] churavis#0000
No wonder the government is willing to buy an infinite amount of them


[09-May-24 02:29 PM] allocater#0000
yup, 200k profit vs 300k


[11-May-24 12:01 PM] allocater#0000
is it possible to know what the instant-assign SCI pool is this week?


[11-May-24 12:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
the worker pool should be 10% of the current unemployed 2275 scientists


[11-May-24 12:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
possibly plus the added 279. Those might be available for instant, mid-week assignment


[11-May-24 12:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
so I guess like 490ish?


[11-May-24 12:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you got big plans, I'll pop Festival 3


[12-May-24 01:19 AM] allocater#0000
I think we can get ENG to 100% happiness without festival, and that's the only real bottleneck


[12-May-24 01:20 AM] allocater#0000
but if it is impossible to get net ENG, because the SCI are stealing all, I guess we have no other choice but to build SCI bases 😄


[16-May-24 11:09 AM] allocater#0000
there appears to be no way to increase ENG, so we have to switch to SCI


[16-May-24 11:40 AM] katinga#0000
dammit Jim!  I'm an ENG, not a SCI!  😄

[16-May-24 03:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Eventually unemployed scientists will get so unhappy that the education from eng->sci will slow down, but it's not really feasible to wait for that.

Increasing employed technicians will help too, but we'd have to do like... 20k more technicians for that to move that needle

[19-May-24 07:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Two points:
1) Actually, happiness will be a bit higher because they are all near 100% fulfillment right now and the averaged happiness is quickly ramping towards that
2) There's an open question about how festival boosts interact with 100% happiness for purposes of education In calculations


[19-May-24 07:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
I already queued up festival 3 which was probably a mistake 😛 oh well. Pumping engineer immigration might be the best program to run, oddly enough. 

Still would be nice to grow the tech population, but that might not be practically achievable


[19-May-24 07:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
But I did swap from to IDCs so that's 540 free engineers... if they actually return to the pool like they are supposed to


[19-May-24 07:40 PM] churavis#0000
There are so few technicians that the education program actually results in fewer engineers than no program

👆 😮 

[20-May-24 02:10 AM] allocater#0000
I am really curious if the ENG shortage will ever take ENG from the 1 permit bases, so far it seems only to take from the 3 permit bases


[20-May-24 02:11 AM] allocater#0000
Also the irony that we wanted to destroy the EDC market by raising FIM and r-fab prices, but now destroy it by reducing the ENG count 😄


[20-May-24 02:21 AM] allocater#0000
we could mention that ENG are in a death spiral, no matter what program runs. I don't think we should get +50 ENG when we could get +100 SCI. It seems the era of ENG is over and everybody should switch to SCI.


[20-May-24 02:26 AM] allocater#0000
education gives the most overall amount

[20-May-24 06:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think maybe "round robin" means it tries to give everyone the same number, so only the people who need like 1000 ENG are losing some


[20-May-24 07:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah


[21-May-24 01:46 AM] allocater#0000
that would actually be good, punish those inefficient bases even more 😄


[21-May-24 01:47 AM] allocater#0000
but so far old 1-permit bases and new 1-permit bases have not gotten the same amount, maybe they will at some point


[21-May-24 12:24 PM] allocater#0000
@Malahat so we came up with an IDC-base process. IDC bases will be available as self-service bases, where you send contracts to me, to request the building materials and supplies for free. In exchange you can sell IDC for 5000, which is 135k income per day. Is anybody interested in upgrading?

{Reactions}
👍 

[21-May-24 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
"self-service" just means that the person running the bases is in charge of sending contracts?


[21-May-24 12:26 PM] allocater#0000
yup


[21-May-24 12:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
So more clicking, but you keep more money by cutting out the middleman (me) 😄

very nice TEC growth. Do we want to sponsor more TEC bases to keep them?


[23-May-24 10:14 AM] melon164#0000
I would be happy to run an SD base if someone can supply me with consumables there at corp prices


[23-May-24 10:15 AM] melon164#0000
I just don’t have the shipping capacity to run a base so far away


[25-May-24 02:50 AM] allocater#0000
So to hold ENG, we actually need an equilibrium between TEC and SCI. The more SCI we get, the more TEC we need to counter balance. Otherwise ENG will approach 0 🤔

[26-May-24 09:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Got more people contacting me about IDC bases. So at least one more of those coming


[26-May-24 09:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that'll be 650 scientists.. But adding 400 a week, I doubt we'll use them all up


[27-May-24 10:45 AM] allocater#0000
what are they writing to you about IDC bases?


[27-May-24 04:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Asking about the population mostly. And wanted a loan to make a malahat base. Which works out nice cause it was at a good rate


[27-May-24 04:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Had a lot of tech growth too.  So hopefully we keep that going


[28-May-24 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm doing a public writeup for malahat. It seems like we added like 16 EDC bases.. but the population is probably only like an extra 3000 engineers employed? Which is more like 6 bases or something?


[28-May-24 02:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
do you mean 16 bases through the bank, or in total? it could also depend on what time period you're looking at. not all the bases are fully staffed yet


[28-May-24 02:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
if it helps, I can gather the employed ENGs from some of our more recent bases

[24-Jun-24 12:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I posted this short update to the local malahat COM channel:


[24-Jun-24 12:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Short Malahat update: Our plan to grow technicians has been working fantastically. Right now Engineer happiness has been pegged to 100%, meaning engineer growth will be 30% of the tech population each week. Thus growing our technicians is the best way to shore up the engineer shortage. Technician employment continues to grow, thanks to many who have stepped up to help with sponsored Tech bases. Next week, engineer growth will outpace the scientist upgrade rate. Employment at the high tiers has grown susbstantially thanks to our team efforts!

In ~2 days the update will land, so anticipate some changes in the weeks following that. The plan for POPI will continue- pushing engineer growth, and accepting the 2500ish unemployed pio and settlers as a cost of the high tier growth. With the new government changes, there may be new opportunities to help contiribute to upkeep on Malahat. That could mean the government will buy your upkeep items, especially TUB, PFE, and SOI. More info on that will come once the update meta stabilizes.


[26-Jun-24 10:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000

I’ve got CIS, I can swap you 1:1

Just send contracts whenever you need it. I keep it on hand for the renters that pay in CIS


[26-Jun-24 09:29 PM] katinga#0000
I can send you EDC conts for CIS.  small ones


[26-Jun-24 09:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Does it work if I just send you the standard 175 EDC one? You get 525k CIS upfront and can just fill the EDC whenever 🙂


[26-Jun-24 09:41 PM] katinga#0000
No cuz I need the AIC more.  there's a reason I moved out of BEN.  the split currencies were killing me.  I needed to focus on 1 pot for a while.  Etherwind, I'm getting a pass on cuz there are no taxes or warehouse rentals there.


[26-Jun-24 09:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
k, then just terminate after I send you the CIS

External scrutiny of the finances will invite Rise to complain 😛

[06-Jul-24 03:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
that makes me wonder if I should spin up a TUB factory 😄


[06-Jul-24 03:54 PM] akyantor#0000
I started making some TUB... wasn't sure if there would be takers, but when I auctioned it yesterday it was snapped up almost immediately. 😛


[06-Jul-24 03:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah TUB and OFF is gonna go fast


[06-Jul-24 03:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
So far since June 26th I've spent $12,980,517.00 on Malahat upkeep ( the starting amount on June 26th counted the past couples weeks or whatever). 

Income so far is about 5m. 

I'm thinking about doing a withdrawl now, but I'm not sure if that should wait til after the election ends in 6 days.


[06-Jul-24 03:56 PM] akyantor#0000
Jeeze... that's a huge turnover


[06-Jul-24 03:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
I figure it'll probably be okay as long as you provide some brief accounting of what you're withdrawing for


[06-Jul-24 03:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah really want to get those open engineer jobs covered.


[06-Jul-24 03:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
folks will probably appreciate that you spent 13M and are withdrawing less than that 😄

I'm starting to think that nearly every planet has been running at a deficit all this time... has anyone come across one yet that had balanced books?


[06-Jul-24 03:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Bobemor used to run his planet exactly at net 0 cost.


[06-Jul-24 03:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
It didn't really work 😬


[06-Jul-24 03:58 PM] akyantor#0000
I guess if you have a corp with one planet, then you could at least tell. If you've more than one you can't


[06-Jul-24 03:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah.


[06-Jul-24 03:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think Malahat will be positive once the contributions settle down

1 or 2 more votes for Hal in the Malahat election will get us 3 spots in the parliament. Would be lovely 😄 Might run into some last minutes shifts though, since there is some vote splitting for 3rd place already.

3 people at 4 votes now


[10-Jul-24 03:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well two lines of thought- don't want to say anything publically cause it draws attention to a soon-to-conclude election. Or can you say something and actually flip someone voting for a non-oog candidate to an oog candidate? I suspect the two non-oog candidates are collecting the voters who don't want a straight oog ticket, so they won't flip

[15-Jul-24 11:11 AM] melon164#0000
Can I get someone who's running SEs to make me 20 DD and 20 DV?


[15-Jul-24 11:11 AM] melon164#0000
I have the inputs for the DD on-site


[15-Jul-24 01:39 PM] domicius#0000
I can do that, just not on Malahat


[15-Jul-24 01:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
We should have a lot of SE-people on malahat. Sidepipe should know them 😄


[15-Jul-24 02:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
We do indeed - @katinga , are you still making EDC on Malahat? And if so, would you be able to make those things for melon?


[15-Jul-24 02:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
And if yes, lmk how long it takes and I can pay you for the lost EDC time 🙂


[15-Jul-24 02:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’d do it myself, but I’m running SL instead now


[15-Jul-24 02:08 PM] domicius#0000
I have 4 IMM on ANT and 5 DD


[15-Jul-24 03:14 PM] katinga#0000
?


[15-Jul-24 03:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
Can you make 20 DD and 20 DV for melon164 if he provides you the inputs?


[15-Jul-24 03:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll pay you for the lost EDC time


[15-Jul-24 03:16 PM] katinga#0000
ok


[15-Jul-24 03:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
How long would one DD and one DV each take if you queued them up?


[15-Jul-24 03:18 PM] katinga#0000
a day


[15-Jul-24 03:18 PM] katinga#0000
they have a run time a 1 day


[15-Jul-24 03:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
cool, and how many SEs do you have? was it 12?


[15-Jul-24 03:19 PM] katinga#0000
18


[15-Jul-24 03:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
so back of the envelope math says 40 days split between 18 labs is 2.2222 days - so call it 3 days? how much EDC do you make per day?


[15-Jul-24 03:21 PM] katinga#0000
runtime on those is 16.39 hrs


[15-Jul-24 03:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
you wouldn't happen to have PMMG installed? 😄


[15-Jul-24 03:22 PM] katinga#0000
I do.  it doesn't work anymore


[15-Jul-24 03:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
ah cool, then some less back of the envelope math it is 😄


[15-Jul-24 03:23 PM] katinga#0000
none of those exterior tools work that well.  2 don't work at all


[15-Jul-24 03:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
24/16.39 = 1.4643 EDC / lab / day, so 1.4643 * 3 * 18 * 3000 = 237,217.8158 AIC 🙂


[15-Jul-24 03:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
so I'll send you 250k to cover the machine time. @melon164 , can you send Katinga the materials?


[15-Jul-24 03:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
If that works for you, that is, Katinga


[15-Jul-24 03:27 PM] katinga#0000

[18-Jul-24 02:05 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Wait how much does an EDC base make?!


[18-Jul-24 02:06 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
250k for 16hrs?


[18-Jul-24 02:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
My IDC base produces 477,112 AIC on inputs of 148,278 per day.


[18-Jul-24 02:10 PM] allocater#0000
We currently have a EDC base as 200k per day profit


[18-Jul-24 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think those XIT FIN numbers I h ave don't count depreciation which is significant


[18-Jul-24 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
but yeah, it's good money 😉 🙂


[18-Jul-24 02:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
We also offer EDC bases through the bank of OOG - we handle all the repairs and consumables, and you get a fixed price on your EDC. That’s what that 250k / 2.2 days figure comes from above


[18-Jul-24 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
everyone should have one!

{Reactions}
💯 

[18-Jul-24 02:16 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I really dislike the idea of a money printer tho… but the money is enticing


[18-Jul-24 02:17 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Why wouldn’t someone just put down 20 EDC bases at his point


[18-Jul-24 02:19 PM] allocater#0000
I think there are only 5 planets suitable for EDC bases (Electronics, free ENGs) but yeah, people do it


[18-Jul-24 02:19 PM] allocater#0000
best we can do it give R-fab producers and FIM producers a bigger chunk of the profits


[18-Jul-24 02:23 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
What do you mean?


[18-Jul-24 02:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
EDC requires lots of Rfabs and FIM as consumables (for repairs and workforce) so more EDC -> higher demand for those things -> higher prices for Rfabs, FIM, etc


[18-Jul-24 02:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Ah


[18-Jul-24 02:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Well I’m just about to setup Rfab production so you guys let me know if you want me to set some aside


[18-Jul-24 02:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Also I guess it’s hard to colonize planets specifically for EDCs


[18-Jul-24 02:25 PM] allocater#0000
I usually buy all R-fabs on all CXs if you like that price


[18-Jul-24 02:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If there is that much demand, I can make it so I produce more of it


[18-Jul-24 02:28 PM] allocater#0000
I think you will have no trouble selling it, if we just build the weekly EDC and IDC base that is already 

348    RBH
144    RDE
372    RSE
60    RTA

per week


[18-Jul-24 02:28 PM] allocater#0000
not the speak of the repairs of the 17 existing bases


[18-Jul-24 02:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Geez well then,I’ll revise my plans, I was holding back because I was worried about overproduction

{Reactions}

[18-Jul-24 02:35 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Should be able to make 6-12 Rfab/day depending on the type


[18-Jul-24 02:36 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Tried to ratio them based on what you stated as needs


[18-Jul-24 02:36 PM] allocater#0000
nice


[18-Jul-24 02:36 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If you ever want me to set some aside just let me know


[18-Jul-24 02:37 PM] allocater#0000
simplest way is to just keep selling on the CX, if I am the highest bidder good, if someone else bids higher, fair game


[18-Jul-24 02:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Sure


[18-Jul-24 03:16 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
In the same vein as project 6115, as there ever been a project to build a OOG exclusive EDC planet


[18-Jul-24 03:17 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Or is it just to wildly expensive^


[18-Jul-24 03:17 PM] sidepipe#0000

Well, that’s maybe not the true end goal. But it was the original answer to the question “what do we use a system with three habitable planets at the end of the galaxy for?”


[18-Jul-24 03:22 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
i see the reasoning


[23-Jul-24 02:00 PM] allocater#0000
We have materials for an IDC base laying around on Malahat, also unemployed SCI. Does anybody want the base?


[23-Jul-24 02:02 PM] allocater#0000
also upgrade from EDC possible


[23-Jul-24 03:02 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Whats the difference between the 2


[23-Jul-24 03:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
One uses Eng and the other (IDC) uses sci so makes more money


[23-Jul-24 03:04 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
im looking at the prunplanner for EDC and i have 11m... is that really the price


[23-Jul-24 03:04 PM] allocater#0000
for EDC you get all the contracts and make ~75k/day. for IDC you have to send all the contracts and get ~120k per day


[23-Jul-24 03:05 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
In what sense, so you pay for the base basicly and get a share of the profits^


[23-Jul-24 03:05 PM] allocater#0000
we have EDC base at 15mil and IDC base at 25mil, because it comes with 50days of supplies


[23-Jul-24 03:06 PM] allocater#0000
yeah you use the permit and get a share of the base profits.


[23-Jul-24 03:08 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Thats interesting, yeah id be down. How long is the agreement for


[23-Jul-24 03:09 PM] allocater#0000
It can run forever, but we need at least 70d to recoup the investment


[23-Jul-24 03:10 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Sure, id be down for the full IDC then. Id need like a day or 2 to get a base permit


[23-Jul-24 03:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
What level are you rn?


[23-Jul-24 03:11 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

yes, this gives this base and you sell all IDC for 2500 to me (any currency you like)

One of the contracts is for 1 day, ill extend it no worries, just assumed you had everythins set aside


[23-Jul-24 03:27 PM] allocater#0000
If I combine with sidepipe storages we have everything, except 20 LDE are missing 😦


[23-Jul-24 03:28 PM] allocater#0000
if you have the permit earlier, you can request 140 LDE and build 80% of the base


[23-Jul-24 03:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Just so i fit within your plans, how often do you expect the IDC deliveries, like 1 per week


[23-Jul-24 03:28 PM] allocater#0000
up to you how fast you want to turn it into money


[23-Jul-24 03:29 PM] allocater#0000
I accept any interval you send 😄

@archielvahr do you need SOI or PFE? I can sell all my outputs to you since Nike won't be using them


[30-Jul-24 07:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
Or OLF


[30-Jul-24 07:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
The 3 pinks, I say


[30-Jul-24 07:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh shoot, @.urpalhal  and @sidepipe  can you run again on malahat?


[30-Jul-24 07:42 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[30-Jul-24 07:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
MemoryAlpha is gonna start shit for the next election.


[30-Jul-24 07:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I see he just started his run


[30-Jul-24 07:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
@hernanduer  Yeah those are great. These are the government's prices for them:


[30-Jul-24 07:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
OLF    $900.00
PFE    $670.00
SOI    $400.00


[30-Jul-24 07:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
The olf might sell higher on the CX


[30-Jul-24 07:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
But that pulls them into sort of similar $/satisfaction numbers

[30-Jul-24 07:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
Archiel, would it help if I took care of some things like bringing bulk DW, OFF or one-off POPI upgrades like you mentioned? You could basically contract it out to me at Malahat prices and I can make the stuff appear


[30-Jul-24 07:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
I could even do the bookkeeping etc if I had edit permissions on the sheet


[30-Jul-24 07:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
It might help reduce the mental load a bit, but it’s really up to what you think would work for you


[30-Jul-24 07:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
you had me at "bookkeeping" 😄


[30-Jul-24 07:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Send me an edit request for the sheet


[30-Jul-24 07:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Let me know what I can do to help too 😊


[30-Jul-24 07:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’m going to add a STO to my base there so


[30-Jul-24 07:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Filling COGC is definitely something that anyone could do. Cause it can't be overfilled. Then we just punch that into the sheet and do a payout.

I am kind of wishy-washy about which POPI I put in. I have a plan, but sometimes I change it based on what's available or what's in stock. So that's hard to coordinate.

Infrastructure upgrades could be a good division too. It is pretty delegatable and I rarely have extra prefabs of my own I want to liquidate. And it's rarely urgent. Also a bunch of them were half upgraded.


[30-Jul-24 07:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
The INF could use a level or two, so I don't have to add stretchers. SST continues to seem fine.


[30-Jul-24 07:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[31-Jul-24 04:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was sort of hoping to not start a conversation on Malahat


[31-Jul-24 04:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe this isn't true, but I sort of feel like less noise is better. A big back-and-forth draws more attention to the cause of the non-incumbents. I'll state my position tomorrow like 6 hr before the election starts.


[31-Jul-24 04:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Like right now mast3rd3mon is just straight up trolling, so I wouldn't respond to that one


[31-Jul-24 04:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess he can fight with Frenetic because he doesn't have an OOG tag


[31-Jul-24 04:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
But it looks a little bad if we wade into the mud with those two


[31-Jul-24 04:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
They actually both sound nuts right now so that's good, lol


[31-Jul-24 04:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, makes sense. I wanted to engage a bit because I can't help but feed the trolls, but I'll stay out 😄

Definitely got out of bed on the wrong side this morning


[31-Jul-24 05:32 PM] akyantor#0000
It’s not a good look suggesting that the taxes could be reduced by 50%, and repeatedly failing to suggest a single change they’d make to balance the books.


[31-Jul-24 05:33 PM] akyantor#0000
If it truly was the case then surely they’d be able to list 2-3 suggested changes.


[31-Jul-24 05:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Heh no worries. I think it worked out well


[31-Jul-24 05:40 PM] archielvahr#0000

I remember those two kicking up a fuss on Malahat previously


[31-Jul-24 08:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
When the currency changed previously mast3 allegedly was so upset he refused to run his buildings, and idled them all


[31-Jul-24 08:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't really understand that logic


[31-Jul-24 08:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I offered to cover his taxes too


[31-Jul-24 08:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, that seems like a losing move imo. stopping your 2-300k/day profit EDC production over 380/u of taxes?


[31-Jul-24 08:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
the math doesn't math


[31-Jul-24 08:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah totally. I think he said he was semi-retired or something, not exactly sure what. I mean he only has two bases so that was half his income


[31-Jul-24 08:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
The other one is Jeetiyu

It’s really nice to see people critically engaging with his ideas though. I feel like that’s a positive


[01-Aug-24 08:37 AM] hernanduer#0000
Looking at the numbers Archiel posts, I don't see how it's possible for him to do anything he's talking about

I kinda agree with Gravy and Ogrebeef. I think it would be totally fair for govs to collect some tax revenue for themselves in the grand scheme of things - it seems unfair to expect people to work for free. But I imagine that would be a pretty unpopular opinion (and I can understand why)

{Reactions}

[01-Aug-24 04:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. If someone is gonna claim to work for free, then they win the election, so as a result, everyone does it for free 🤷‍♂️


[01-Aug-24 04:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm not saying we should do that on Malahat. But if a third-party gov on a planet I was on suggested that, I wouldn't be upset


[01-Aug-24 04:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
anyway, the election is officially open! guess we'll see how things go 🙂


[01-Aug-24 04:29 PM] akyantor#0000
If you assume that a planet pays out the market-ish price for any upkeep goods, then the margin between that price and how much you actually pay is a kind of recompense for the effort made to procure and deliver them. At least in my head.


[01-Aug-24 04:31 PM] akyantor#0000
That works both for a governor who supply’s them, or if it’s via an open submission scheme


[01-Aug-24 04:31 PM] akyantor#0000
If someone is unhappy at the size of that margin then go drive the market price down…


[01-Aug-24 04:38 PM] akyantor#0000
That said, probably works better on a planet with less complex needs than somewhere like Malahat


[01-Aug-24 04:56 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I have the Nascent material reimbursement costs set a little below the CX price, so I'm still making a profit, just less than if I were selling on the CX.  Nascent is much simpler though, being almost all PIO

[01-Aug-24 05:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[04-Aug-24 06:04 AM] akyantor#0000
I've all of the contstruction materials, so have built the base and habs


[04-Aug-24 06:30 AM] allocater#0000
without it, it will probably be 50% efficiency and not profitable. MEA will arrive in ~24h


[04-Aug-24 06:30 AM] akyantor#0000
np, just as well I asked.


[04-Aug-24 06:34 AM] akyantor#0000
And one last question about the arrangement. The first 50 days of consumables are provided, are they re-supplied, or do I refill them? *Just so I know if I should be reserving some of the income to resupply.*


[04-Aug-24 06:35 AM] allocater#0000
the resupply will come every 50d and the repair supply every 90d 🙂


[04-Aug-24 06:36 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, cool. Didn't want to get carried away using the income and discover that I couldn't resupply. 😛


[04-Aug-24 06:36 AM] allocater#0000
of course you can quit anytime if you return the demolish refunds 😄


[04-Aug-24 06:36 AM] akyantor#0000
That's fine. Thanks


[04-Aug-24 09:36 AM] allocater#0000
actually, if you request 300 MEA you can start the base today


[04-Aug-24 09:37 AM] akyantor#0000
Sure, let me create a new local market contract


[04-Aug-24 09:38 AM] akyantor#0000
done

And we're cooking.


[04-Aug-24 09:57 AM] akyantor#0000
Ergh, won't be at full speed until the pop fills out, have a good chunk but not all of the workforce required


[05-Aug-24 02:52 AM] akyantor#0000
allocator: Should I terminate the existing MEA contract which is for 1,400, and send a new one for 1,100? *To reflect the initial 300 you've already provided.*


[05-Aug-24 10:49 AM] allocater#0000
yes that would be great for sync and book-keeping


[07-Aug-24 12:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sorry @.urpalhal  and @sidepipe , I was late passing a workforce program on Malahat. If you could vote in the next handful of hours it would be helpful so I can start it before the next POPI 😬

[09-Aug-24 04:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's probably a good thing to keep in mind for next time. eventhough i kinda don't like the optics of switching votes last minute


[09-Aug-24 11:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
At your leisure, there is a payout for the remaining POPI balances. Exciting to have it all at 0

I expect memoryalpha will ignore it so it'll take the full day


[09-Aug-24 11:30 PM] archielvahr#0000

[10-Aug-24 09:31 AM] archielvahr#0000
We could add a total of 3 levels to the INF and that would stop using TUB. I don't really think that's a super high priority


[10-Aug-24 09:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
hum I don't really think I see anything else that needs an upgrade. I thought I had a different conclusion last time I looked


[11-Aug-24 02:03 AM] akyantor#0000
@allocater I accidently did the previous contract the wrong way around (buy rather than sell IDC). Sent another contract to reverse it, and sell the originally intended amount. :S


[11-Aug-24 02:03 AM] allocater#0000
Nice, but that contract was about RAT 😄

Not gonna lie IDC feels like a money cheat...


[16-Aug-24 09:41 AM] allocater#0000
That's why more people have to do it, so it declines in profitability


[16-Aug-24 09:42 AM] allocater#0000
all the profit should shift to r-fab and consumables producers


[16-Aug-24 09:42 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's at MM


[16-Aug-24 09:42 AM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, but more people doing it drives up the price of the inputs


[16-Aug-24 09:42 AM] marat_sh#0000
I see what you mean


[16-Aug-24 09:42 AM] allocater#0000
if the r-fab and consumable producers take more of the pie, the passive IDC bases will get less


[16-Aug-24 09:42 AM] marat_sh#0000
Still feels cheaty


[16-Aug-24 09:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'm assuming they'll probably nerf the MMs in the future again too. And I get what you're saying - it's an imperfect solution for increasing the demand for goods that otherwise don't have a huge demand


[16-Aug-24 09:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
I guess gov contracts are money cheats IRL as well


[16-Aug-24 09:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think part of the problem is that there's very few ENG / SCI products that have a broad use in the economy, at least from my (limited) knowledge. There's some shipbuilding and electronics, but the playerbase is small enough that the demand for those is pretty infrequent. And there's HQ upgrades, of course


[16-Aug-24 09:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
We've probably put 100s of millions of bank money into EDC and IDC. Eventhough the returns are high, the costs are also high, so the ROI on most of those bases is 50-60 days. There could be investments with a much better ROI, but there's not many sectors of the economy you can sink that kind of money into without absolutely tanking returns


[16-Aug-24 09:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
I guess the game is still in early access stage. But free passive money makers shouldn't exist in economic game no matter the reasons


[16-Aug-24 09:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
I'm guessing by free you mean risk-free? 😄


[16-Aug-24 09:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
yeah risk free


[16-Aug-24 09:51 AM] allocater#0000
it turns FIM and R-fabs into money. It's so profitable because people keep selling FIM and r-fabs for so cheap.


[16-Aug-24 09:53 AM] allocater#0000
there is some progress, EDC bases make 200k/day and farmbases used to be 10k/day. Now it is 200k vs 50k


[16-Aug-24 09:53 AM] allocater#0000
at some point inflation will make it so every base makes 100k/day


[16-Aug-24 09:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
if everyone is rich, nobody is


[16-Aug-24 09:54 AM] allocater#0000
yeah, it will just be a more balanced economy


[16-Aug-24 09:55 AM] allocater#0000
people won't even build 50k/day bases anymore, because 50k is not worth much


[16-Aug-24 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think it would probably help if they raised the MMs on some of the goods like bfabs as well. But in general I feel like people like to provide downward pressure on most prices in the game


[16-Aug-24 09:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
...myself included 😄


[16-Aug-24 09:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
I guess the time scale for ROI changed since old times. Like I am a new player and ROI > 15 d not worth producing


[16-Aug-24 09:57 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But that’s because you are new and poor


[16-Aug-24 09:57 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
At some point there is also saturation if everyone does the same thing. The economy self balances, it just lags a bit


[16-Aug-24 09:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
well, I think a lot of the lower ROI options are quite cheap, as well


[16-Aug-24 09:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
so it's not as much worth it for more wealthy players because you're getting a 15day ROI on a 1M investment, but you have 50M in the bank


[16-Aug-24 09:59 AM] sidepipe#0000
(just made up numbers)


[16-Aug-24 10:00 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah, on large scale it matters less and less


[16-Aug-24 10:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
heck, i've been doing FX stuff for a 1.5% ish return just because I have some idle money


[16-Aug-24 10:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
anyway, I 100% agree with you that there shouldn't be any risk-free money makers. I think it'd be super interesting if the game had a central bank instead for a small fixed return like treasury bills in real life. I just think that the one redeeming feature of EDC/IDC is that it increases demand for rfabs, fim etc which impact big portions of the economy


[16-Aug-24 10:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
and i personally think that would work better if they nerfed EDC and make IDC more profitable to drive demand for the really high tier goods, since those themselves require more bases to make


[16-Aug-24 10:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
(i also clearly benefit a lot from edc and idc, so take what I say with as many grains of salt as needed 😄 )

Agreed, i trickles all the way down to keep those bases fed


[17-Aug-24 03:22 AM] melon164#0000
They could go a long way just by increasing the consumption rate of some of the SCI consumables


[17-Aug-24 08:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
Seriously, the fact LC are consumed at like .1/100/month is insane

[21-Aug-24 01:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which tend to be 800 / 1200 or 1400 for scientists


[21-Aug-24 01:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
which is why I wanted to hit 400 😄


[21-Aug-24 01:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
do you think MemoryAlpha will vote yes? 😄


[21-Aug-24 01:45 PM] allocater#0000
300 would be a nicer rounder number 😄


[21-Aug-24 01:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not sure if MemoryAlpha is just going to continue protest-abstaining to slow things down or not


[21-Aug-24 01:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was eyeballing the math to keep the ratios similar to EDC vs. IDC taxes. (although I think we want to encourage IDC because scientists are currently easier than engineers)


[21-Aug-24 01:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
once you hit scientist, you can't learn anything else. you reached the peak of your career


[21-Aug-24 01:52 PM] allocater#0000
do ENG have a long term stable future or will they go into decline again after the TEC fall below the SCI?


[21-Aug-24 01:53 PM] allocater#0000
then we should indeed tax ENG a bit more because they are like a "pop-valley"


[21-Aug-24 01:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I dropped Techs because I want more people to do tech bases. I don't really think people make decisions like that.. esp for tech bases on an electronics planet. No one wants SEs.

[21-Aug-24 01:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
It will kind of continue to be a fight. Since when they are happy they will turn from ENGs to SCIs.


[21-Aug-24 01:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
ah yeah, yep


[21-Aug-24 01:54 PM] allocater#0000
ENG also cost more because they need unemployed TEC to be sustained


[21-Aug-24 01:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah


[21-Aug-24 01:55 PM] allocater#0000
that can be added to their tax rate

Hm so if they want a sponsored tech base, the options are kinda: 12 labs (840 techs) or 16 SD, (800 techs). In both cases I don't really care what they make. For similar setups where I provide everything I pay like $200k/w 

For a random new player it maybe makes sense for me to subsidize construction and just leave them to it.

I'd suggest setting a day for everyone to trade for a final shipment to the CX prior to the change.

[26-Aug-24 02:15 PM] akyantor#0000
SF going up to 18 isn't nothing either... we hit the MM quite a bit in the last week. Will potentially make SF more profitable


[26-Aug-24 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Pretty small boost to CBL. Interesting how big the boost to FFC is...


[26-Aug-24 02:16 PM] allocater#0000
that cbl boost got the profit of a base from 80k to 300k 😮


[26-Aug-24 02:16 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[26-Aug-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect the new fuel type happens in a REF too. So the SF change might tie into that nicely


[26-Aug-24 02:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
imagine if it would use CBL with other element for fuel gates


[26-Aug-24 02:19 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Seeing what on that list, my going theory is that its gate things


[26-Aug-24 02:19 PM] marat_sh#0000

NV1/2, CBL/CBM


[26-Aug-24 02:22 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
How much of a gamble would it be to try to setup some of those things,.. worst thing than can happen is it’s sold to mm. Best case it’s a stockpile ready to go


[26-Aug-24 02:23 PM] allocater#0000
have to math it, but I think NV1/2 is still not profitable at that MM. But CBL/M is.

How many bases are in the EDC and IDC programs?


[11-Sep-24 03:04 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv had a lot of demand through Shrewdbank so interest is still there

I have peeked at the bank sheet but can't always make sense of it 😄

But I think people wanna do it on there own


[11-Sep-24 03:04 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
So maybe a better model would be selling the packages and get the profit up front


[11-Sep-24 03:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well the main goal was getting the capital making money

10 EDC + 7 IDC bases under managment

{Reactions}
👍 

[11-Sep-24 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
unless the capital is just to fund rfab bases so we have fabs to sell


[11-Sep-24 03:07 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My point is more that instead of sponsoring the bases, it can just be in the form of a loan. And you make money but on the sale and the interest


[11-Sep-24 03:07 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Also, not offering the consumables reduces the price tag and makes it more appealing


[11-Sep-24 03:07 PM] allocater#0000
yeah but you still need to trust the players to play for 90d+ days


[11-Sep-24 03:07 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Indeed


[11-Sep-24 03:08 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That is the main risk


[11-Sep-24 03:08 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But that’s always the risk


[11-Sep-24 03:09 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Regardless of how it’s structured


[11-Sep-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ohhh yeah I misunderstood. I see what you are saying.


[11-Sep-24 03:09 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Would it be worth it to expand to another planet? Instead of putting it all on Malahat. 
That way once you have someone solid you can setup 2 bass instead of one


[11-Sep-24 03:10 PM] allocater#0000
that could be a way, still leaves unemployed SCI on malahat though


[11-Sep-24 03:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
What’s our default rate on the current way it is run?


[11-Sep-24 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Jeetiyu has a lot of sci now. They are mimicking the Malahat growth. But I can chill on malahat if we want. To some extent I can’t stop sci growth but I can stop eng growth, and slow sci.


[11-Sep-24 03:11 PM] allocater#0000
you mean ROI for the bank? at 90d it's still a loss of 6mil, since a new consumables pack has to be delivered


[11-Sep-24 03:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
The rate of people defaulting on the base agreement- like people who build a base and just disappear


[11-Sep-24 03:14 PM] allocater#0000
that's was only 1, so 5%, but a lot end the deal after 50d and go solo


[11-Sep-24 03:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm yeah I guess it's not _always underwater_ but there's a long time before it's solid profit


[11-Sep-24 03:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
ahhh


[11-Sep-24 03:15 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[11-Sep-24 03:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
lol I've been running mine (EDC then IDC) for over a year probably


[11-Sep-24 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Do you know the total number of bases build through the lifetime of the program?


[11-Sep-24 03:20 PM] allocater#0000
good question


[11-Sep-24 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Psychologically there's some sort of  difference between the loan model and the sponsored base model. I don't know how it moves the needle on defaults. I would feel a bit nervous with a bunch of 30m contracts out, that's probably colored by Hazzaah, especially since some of those loans were supposed to be for IDC bases


[11-Sep-24 03:21 PM] allocater#0000
Should be ~30 if we kept track of the ex-bases correctly

[01-Nov-24 12:51 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
im not opposed imo


[01-Nov-24 12:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
and if we wanted to be really antagonistic, we could just hike the taxes on him since they're outside of faction space 😛


[01-Nov-24 12:51 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
i thought about it but doing it (at least the settling there) but im afraid of the fall out


[01-Nov-24 12:52 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
but im all for competition


[01-Nov-24 12:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, I've thought about that too


[01-Nov-24 12:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
but I think we should be pretty safe now that we have a pretty significant population on our OS-099 planets (i think)


[01-Nov-24 12:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
_especially_ since they are far out and not suitable for SL yet


[01-Nov-24 12:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
so it would be a big upfront investment in ICA to take over the planet, but all it does is open up a triple green electronics / manufacturing planet miles away from anywhere


[01-Nov-24 12:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
anyway, I'd gladly volunteer a permit and a ship once the time comes. I think Archiel said we'd just need to land in the last 24 hours of an election so he can't transfer the base fee to his personal account


[01-Nov-24 02:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd be up for doing it as a proof of concept, not to be malicious. If we all drop the bases the day before a vote ends, we can all vote for ourselves and get our money back, probably without anyone even noticing until the election ends


[01-Nov-24 02:06 PM] allocater#0000
I am intrigued


[01-Nov-24 02:06 PM] allocater#0000
which planet are we invading?


[01-Nov-24 02:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
To be clear, I wasn’t saying I was up for hiking the taxes - just a thought I had. No point in setting an awful precedent 😄


[01-Nov-24 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I dunno which, but here's the list. I think they are all electronics:

[01-Nov-24 02:40 PM] allocater#0000
and we only need 1 ship with materials for 5 CMs?


[01-Nov-24 02:41 PM] allocater#0000
then 4 people request base teleports


[01-Nov-24 02:41 PM] allocater#0000
maybe the government account even has money in it we can loot 😄


[01-Nov-24 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
🤣


[01-Nov-24 02:41 PM] allocater#0000
(in addition to the base fees)


[01-Nov-24 06:05 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im up for it


[01-Nov-24 06:05 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im in mor already if we need a ship


[02-Nov-24 01:39 AM] allocater#0000
next planet is YA-646b, in 4 days, 2 people are enough to capture it


[02-Nov-24 01:41 AM] allocater#0000
if you load your ship with 5 base kits (+ TSH!) and send me 1 base kit on location, we are go


[02-Nov-24 01:43 AM] allocater#0000
he might request a supporter to also land, so the more people we are and the closer we do it to the deadline the higher the success chance


[02-Nov-24 01:52 AM] allocater#0000
or do we need 4 people, so we get 2 x 2 votes for the 2 parliament seats? what does the government do if it is 1v1 deadlocked?


[02-Nov-24 02:26 AM] melon164#0000
Governor wins ties


[02-Nov-24 03:01 AM] allocater#0000
then 2 votes are enough


[02-Nov-24 09:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. Hours before the election ends is best.


[02-Nov-24 10:02 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
That might be doable. im gonna check were my ships are and let you guys know


[02-Nov-24 10:02 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Who is in so I know how many CM kits to bring?

[02-Nov-24 10:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
I’m in if I can get a free permit in time!


[02-Nov-24 10:15 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
This being said, how hard would it be to take over and turn into an elec planet XD-005c? Would it be more money efficient


[02-Nov-24 10:16 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
or in general another planet that would have close to the required pops


[02-Nov-24 10:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t think it’s too hard to make an electronics planet, I know some of the planets in Nyx are destined for that


[02-Nov-24 10:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
But this will make a better story 😁


[02-Nov-24 10:20 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
for sure but firefreaks planet dont have unused pops... so its the same as starting over


[02-Nov-24 10:26 AM] mrsmith33#0000
The growth will be quicker than on empty planet


[02-Nov-24 10:36 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
YA-471a would be a much nicer target and the next election is only in 9 days


[02-Nov-24 10:37 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can take care of the deliveries there but I dont have the knowledge to run the planet well


[02-Nov-24 10:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’ll give me more time to organize a permit 😄


[02-Nov-24 10:37 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
It currently has 200 free eng as well


[02-Nov-24 10:37 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
and a beginning of SCI


[02-Nov-24 11:53 AM] allocater#0000
YA-471 a even has a "casus belli": "we just wanted to employ the ENG" 😄


[02-Nov-24 11:54 AM] allocater#0000
that being said, I thought it's just a quick knock for fun, go in and out, 10 minute adventure. Or do we want to stay longterm?


[02-Nov-24 11:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think there could be value in opening up one of the planets to everyone

Since we’re all gonna feel the fallout of whatever we do 😄


[02-Nov-24 03:59 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Using the base establishment fee to lock people out from planets is pretty scummy


[02-Nov-24 04:00 PM] marat_sh#0000
it's one of the type of 'warfare' in this game


[02-Nov-24 04:05 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
It will be hilarious if they implement the ability to apply trade tariffs


[02-Nov-24 04:05 PM] akyantor#0000
And people say you can't have wars in the game. Nonsense, economic combat or planetary control is where its at


[02-Nov-24 04:05 PM] akyantor#0000
Just because you can't have ships blowing stuff up doesn't mean you can't have conflict.


[02-Nov-24 04:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
Unless we do it 😇


[02-Nov-24 04:07 PM] akyantor#0000
Just don't look too close at Nyx. 😛


[02-Nov-24 04:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it’s not like anyone was colonizing there anyway


[02-Nov-24 04:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Even if we had 0 fees I don’t think any non-OOG folks would join for a long time


[02-Nov-24 04:09 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
😳


[02-Nov-24 04:10 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, it's a bit of a niche project out there


[02-Nov-24 04:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
To be fair I agree with you in principle, and this will be a good example of how those base fee barriers can be broken down if there’s enough people who want to / a good enough reason to


[02-Nov-24 04:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
I assume people might make a move on Nyx eventually. But we have a good population there, and no one can make IDC there yet, so I think we’ll be safe for a bit 😄


[02-Nov-24 07:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a permit available. I'll probably wipe the base after a few weeks, because I need another gateway base soon.


[02-Nov-24 07:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lemme know if you need cash for the project


[02-Nov-24 07:53 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Depends on what are @allocater with his deposits

depends on if somebody parks a 5 base kit freighter in orbit

What are the loan conditions for a malahat IDC base?


[16-Nov-24 01:16 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
@allocater


[16-Nov-24 01:19 AM] allocater#0000
in the corp scheme there is no loan, you just get everything for free and sell the IDC back for 5000/IDC.

if you want to operate more independently, you can do it with a 27mil loan and sell the IDC for 15,300/IDC see: https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1231168997345460286


[16-Nov-24 01:21 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
I'll take the corp route if you have the resources on hand


[16-Nov-24 01:22 AM] allocater#0000
great! I do have everything ready. You can find the full request list also in this channel as pinned post


[16-Nov-24 01:23 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
Cool, I'll send it as soon as I get another permit

Sounds like a good article for the prosperous turnip! Or the OOG site


[26-Nov-24 06:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
For prosperous turnip I think it's Kovus (but also Saganaki)


[26-Nov-24 06:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
For OOG, just send it to me.. if anyone writes anything they want posted, I'll post it


[26-Nov-24 06:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Both sites use Hugo, so you just write it in markdown


[26-Nov-24 06:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
which is essentially plain text


[26-Nov-24 07:29 PM] evov#0000
Sounds like a good reason to invest in Antarean infrastructure, build up more local high tier workforce capacity.

Gotta get more people moving to Nyx!


[27-Nov-24 05:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Malahat election closes in a day. I would favor Fenetic over "ThreeE" who I haven't heard of. Probably doesn't matter much since Sidepipe and I have solid leads

[08-Dec-24 09:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
For /project if you just type the command and hit return it will give you instructions on how to format the material string


[08-Dec-24 09:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
You can also do /order instead especially if it’s only a couple items. That one has instructions on the web page


[08-Dec-24 09:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
At early HQ upgrade levels you can do a few at a time too


[09-Dec-24 03:36 AM] tyrandia#0000
@allocater Hey, is this base sponsorship still available? I'd be interested in getting this set up for you. 🙂

yes, I am currently replenishing the stock, but you can already request all materials as in the pinned post

Malahat CEOs Rally Against "CIS Tyranny," Demand Right to Pay Taxes...
MALAHAT, RC-040 - In what observers are calling the largest gathering since the Great Electronics Embargo of 2289, dozens of corporate executives assembled in the Malahat Administrative Complex yesterday, demanding the right to pay their planetary taxes in “honest AIC” rather than what protesters termed “oppressive CIS credits.”

@draconisdomini sending over repairs for your EDC base!


[18-Dec-24 02:06 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Can you send the contracts again? I was travelling and missed them before they expired


[18-Dec-24 07:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
sent 🙂


[20-Dec-24 09:07 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Probably because it was left a bit too long I need a bit more for repairs. 16 RBH, 18 RDE, 18 RSE, 18 RTA and 16 TRU

good morning @allocater 
is there still capacity on your side for a Malahat base?


[21-Dec-24 08:08 AM] allocater#0000
yes, I can make it happen before Christmas. Do you want the corp-deal, where you sell for 5000/IDC?


[21-Dec-24 08:17 AM] allocater#0000
in any case you can already request all materials on the LM


[21-Dec-24 08:23 AM] roche3950#0000

[21-Dec-24 05:59 PM] roche3950#0000
One question about this -- are consumables and repairs serviced for the duration of the deal, or are they out-of-pocket for the operator beyond the initial package?


[21-Dec-24 11:07 PM] allocater#0000
as long as you keep selling for 5000/IDC, full repair and consumables are provided for free every 50d/90d.


[22-Dec-24 03:43 AM] roche3950#0000
Understood tyvm


[22-Dec-24 02:42 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Thanks.  Still need 2 more RBH and 18 TRU


[22-Dec-24 02:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’m still waiting on the TRU from allocater


[22-Dec-24 02:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
So once the resupply is done, I’ll ask for an updated BOM just to make sure we get it right the third time 😅


[22-Dec-24 02:54 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Haha, cool


[22-Dec-24 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000

[23-Dec-24 03:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
@draconisdomini repair mats are in - if you can send me a screenshot of the BRA and your inventory whenever you have time, I'll send whatever else you need


[23-Dec-24 03:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
just make sure to set the repair window to 48 hours 😄


[23-Dec-24 04:39 PM] draconisdomini#0000

I usually have a sell contract at the top of my CONTD, but I made a new one for the first round of stuff I sent you and it's been messing me up ever since. I sent you the real, actual, final set of contracts


[24-Dec-24 05:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
sorry about all the contracts

Looks like sidepipe needs another vote to maintain the status quo governance structure on Malahat. As it stands ThreeE will take his spot as MP, and OOG will lose effective control.

@agm114, you're up next for both repairs and consumables. I think the tracker might be out of sync for your base, so if you could send me a screenshot of the BRA for malahat, I can get you sorted

At about 80 days maybe

{Reactions}
💸 

[18-Apr-25 12:53 PM] allocater#0000
With the new MM prices there will be less profit in EDC/IDC bases. I think we can still maintain them for a modest profit, but if you have ideas for more profitable permits, now might be a good opportunity to give up the base.

The bases will give you:
EDC base: 45k / day (bank pays 1500/EDC)
IDC base: 60k / day (bank pays 2000/IDC)

Plus you can get an extra +15k/day (+500 per EDC/IDC) bonus if you send out the contracts to request supplies and sell the output.
(Otherwise sidepipe will send you contracts and take the 15k/day)


[18-Apr-25 01:13 PM] akyantor#0000
🫠 Good luck governors will all the IDC/EDC bases disappearing

It's already done.


[27-Apr-25 08:31 AM] akyantor#0000
I had to move quickly when I realised I'd already hit 90 days since the last repair. Wanted to maximise the mats I'd return to allocater who runs the programme.

@katinga - is your base on Malahat needing repairs? I think I sent you some sort of supply or repair pack recently, but didn't mark it on the spreadsheet


[27-Apr-25 04:39 PM] katinga#0000
It's at 78%.  the last cont was consumables

which is probably not what anyone would actually pay if they were buying it on the CX

ah you are HER now. That's should be around 60k at 2800

It’ll look better with 5 experts


[30-Apr-25 01:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
But yeah, HER prices are weird atm


[30-Apr-25 01:03 PM] allocater#0000
can you buy 1 HER for 3000? maybe it fixes the price band

thanks, worked. MM wall is back in place

[30-Apr-25 01:12 PM] swatacular#0000
So somethings up


[30-Apr-25 01:13 PM] allocater#0000
the thing about FP is, you are not committing, since you can switch between DW,RAT,FIM,MEA,etc easily


[30-Apr-25 01:14 PM] allocater#0000
and for some reason FP bases have been at 100k/day for a long time. Even though they are cheap to build and ROI in 1 week


[30-Apr-25 01:16 PM] swatacular#0000
Well I’m committing if I’m on Iron forge though right? Cause there’s no water? Or do I have that wrong


[30-Apr-25 01:16 PM] swatacular#0000
Is FP step 2 and Water is needed for Step 1
