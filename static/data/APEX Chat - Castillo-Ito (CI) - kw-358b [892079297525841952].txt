**Ryst**:	Well, hey there, @Efca. I totally missed that someone else joined. Welcome to the lonesome planet. Or, "Rin Tin Tin", as I like to call it.


[13-Oct-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	hi :)


[27-Oct-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	FYI, I'm willing & able to contribute to planetary projects. Just let me know in the future...


[29-Oct-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	no worries we just needed it asap as we moved our smelters in the area


[20-Dec-21 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	You know, I'm a little surprised that no one else has shown up here yet besides the two of us...


[20-Dec-21 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	it's an expensive planet to settle


[21-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Not that I don't agree, but still... If the ROI is positive (which it is), meh... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Jontos**:	Hello people! I like your unofficial name of the place :)


[14-Jan-22 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Howdy, Jontos! Welcome. Glad to have you make the planet a little less lonely!


[15-Jan-22 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Thank you! I'm excited to be here.

**Jontos**:	Welcome neke!


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Hello!


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Now that I'm here and setup, I realise it was cheaper to buy off the LM LOL


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'm certainly happy to contribute to planetary projects


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	just tell me when and where!


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Also I'd like to submit a name suggestion: Giedi Prime


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you don't know it, it's the the hostile industrial homeworld of the harkonnen (the "bad guys" in Dune)


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	You must have a great LM, and also LM is not as fun as settling new and unexplored worlds!


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	efca was sellnig excess ALO cheaply :)


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	That's what drew me here


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But yes definitely, I prefer to come here myself!


[22-Feb-22 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I see! Yeh, definitely getting stocked up on ALO quickly here


[22-Feb-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I've been the first person on 5 of the 7 planets on which I have bases. It's *much* more entertaining, IMO.


[23-Feb-22 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	So when are we putting a COGC here for ResEx so I can cut down on the base size?


[23-Feb-22 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I might organise an SST over the next few days too, got a bit of a backlog to clear but should be fine after that


[23-Feb-22 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	SST?


[23-Feb-22 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Is planetary projects more expensive on harsh planets too?


[23-Feb-22 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Shit I didn‚Äôt think of that but it doesn‚Äôt look like it on the POPI project


[23-Feb-22 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I don't know what they usually cost, was just curious


[23-Feb-22 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	We have 17% unemployment of PIOs, and you're talking about decreasing base size. Why would we need to put up a SST?


[23-Feb-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	well my first ask is a cogc

[07-Apr-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Apr-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Doesn‚Äôt look like this place grew?


[07-Apr-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Is anyone alive here?


[07-Apr-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'm sourcing the components for a COGC


[07-Apr-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Just need to find 16 BWS


[07-Apr-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'll likely do an SST for shits and giggles


[07-Apr-22 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	It seems like everyone else here produces what we need (or more) already. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[07-Apr-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Doesn't look like much of it makes it off planet


[07-Apr-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	the LM ads stopped


[07-Apr-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	AL is expensive


[07-Apr-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	ALO is absent from the CX


[07-Apr-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	We can do significantly more?


[07-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You don't have to contribute :)


[07-Apr-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	"Can" and "want" are two *very* different things. ;-)


[07-Apr-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'm here to bring more capability and capacity to Katoa :)


[07-Apr-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	As I did with water and a few other initiatives


[07-Apr-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I came earlier but didn't have the underlying infrastructure setup on my other bases, so left


[07-Apr-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	That is different now


[07-Apr-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I've secured all the COGC materials @Ryst so, prepare for more output!


[07-Apr-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Who else is active here?


[07-Apr-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Well, I'm doing the same thing on a couple other planets. More to come on that soon. :-) In any case, I know how you feel. I just personally don't really care about producing more AL. I'm into other stuff. :-)


[07-Apr-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	You can sell it to me then ^_^


[07-Apr-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	JS-570a right?


[07-Apr-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That's one of the planets, yes.


[07-Apr-22 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Will be promoting that one as a Chemistry planet.


[08-Apr-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	naice


[08-Apr-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	COGC and SST are up and running :)


[08-Apr-22 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Defaulted to PIO on the first cycle, not sure if I clicked something wrong or not, but I've voted for Resource Extraction next obviously


[08-Apr-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That's what it does automatically on the first cycle after being built.


[09-Apr-22 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Safe bet


[09-Apr-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Awesome!


[18-Apr-22 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Are there only four of us here? @Jontos @Ryst and Aerostat?


[18-Apr-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Looks like it. 417 of 424 available plots on the planet... which would be 7 used slots... minus 3 for the LM, COGC, and POPI.


[18-Apr-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Yeh, sounds about right


[18-Apr-22 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And you guys are all just focussed on ALO?


[18-Apr-22 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	FEO seems to be wildly uneconomic


[18-Apr-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Two EXTs and one INC here.


[18-Apr-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Might as well make use of the experts...


[18-Apr-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I've just setup 12 EXT and 3 SME


[18-Apr-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	full 500 area used


[19-Apr-22 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Ah, I see what you were asking. Most of the time I forget that this planet even has FEO.


[19-Apr-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	In any case, I don't like transporting heavy stuff. My 2 EXTs were overproducing *slightly* before, so with the COGC they certainly are. Might choose to not rebuild one of them come repair time.


[19-Apr-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I do a little bit of both to supply my prefab mk1 and mk2


[19-Apr-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Nice!


[19-Apr-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Well. I‚Äôll be running ships regularly, do you want me to spam this channel so we can cooperate on shipping. I arrive mostly empty but leave full, but if there‚Äôs demand I can help ship out as well - especially to Benten/Katoa


[19-Apr-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Or if you guys have yourselves sorted I can spare the noise


[20-Apr-22 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I myself is basically running shuttle traffic with full loads back to Umbra, so I'm sorted for now. I'm also available to bring materials back here if needed.


[21-Apr-22 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'll have a 3rd ship in the somewhat near future, so I should be good for awhile. May toss up a random shipping ad occasionally, but it won't be anything regular.


[22-Apr-22 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Nice


[22-Apr-22 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	my third FTL is on a waitlist somewhere


[24-Apr-22 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	That is fine by me, I produce more than I need by far already. I should probably expand but I'm dreading the increased logistics, don't like shipping Limestone


[24-Apr-22 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	yeah i‚Äôm drawing the line at bringing smelting items haha


[24-Apr-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	So... I do my smelting on KW-689a. It's one hop to the east. Tier 2 planet (only requires SEA). Figured I'd put a COGC on it after the one that I'm currently working on (just waiting for parts to arrive). That planet could be the metallurgy planet. It's one hop from here, and one hop from Gibson (Construction COGC). Just something to consider... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[25-Apr-22 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If you're working on your 12th upgrade, you have the permits. The tiny percentage increase to production that's obtained from having more permits than bases isn't a major concern, IMO.


[29-Apr-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	\]


[29-Apr-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Don't expect it regularly. I just had a build-up that I didn't want to bother shipping anywhere. I'm sure it'll continue happen occasionally in the future though.


[29-Apr-22 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	^_^


[29-Apr-22 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	lmk if it builds up with O and FLX :P


[29-Apr-22 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Well, *definitely* don't hold your breath on those... I produce C here. I don't produce the others here (and really only toss in a batch when I absolutely need it).


[29-Apr-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Can I ask what your base layout here is? I'm intrigued


[29-Apr-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you want, I can fit small batches of your overflow into shipping back to the exchange, no reason to dump it


[29-Apr-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'm flying in and out of here every day


[29-Apr-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	every *other day


[29-Apr-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I just extract here. A couple EXTs (maybe more in the future ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) and an INC (to make use of the experts).


[29-Apr-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	C isn't my main product. And I'm sure I still make a profit at that price. So I'm fine with dumping it occasionally and letting someone else (do the shipping or smelting work and) make a profit on it.


[29-Apr-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	But thanks for the offer, in any case. üôÇ


[29-Apr-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Ah I forget INC is extraction


[29-Apr-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	i‚Äôll pay 225 for it any day :)


[29-Apr-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	every day even


[29-Apr-22 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Do "random" people come here for the LM?


[29-Apr-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'll keep that in mind!


[17-May-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iridium**:	hello! just here to drill for some ALO


[17-May-22 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jun-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Shipped out my MCG to Proxion just yesterday


[09-Jun-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	would anyone like to sell off some ALO?


[09-Jun-22 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iridium**:	how much you looking for?


[09-Jun-22 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iridium**:	oh a full ship i see


[09-Jun-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	didn‚Äôt have to be that precisely, just thought i‚Äôd put something up


[10-Jun-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	@neke86 I have a lot of ALO on Proxion that you could buy a shipful from if you want


[10-Jun-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	All good mate, my SMEs are here and this is where the shipping comes


[10-Jun-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	It's not really urgent


[10-Jun-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	But thought I'd ask in case someone was wanting to empty a STO


[10-Jun-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	transfer a shipping problem to someone else


[10-Jun-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I understand


[10-Jun-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Thanks for the offer though


[10-Jun-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	my proxion base is pure agriculture


[10-Jun-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I'm in the middle of moving my Prefab plants to Proxion, so my stores are a bit of a mess right now


[10-Jun-22 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	gotta be done!

[10-Jun-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Ahoy!


[10-Jun-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Welcome to our hostile little corner of space


[10-Jun-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I've setup a COGC and SST, and maintain it myself - but any assistance would be appreciated


[10-Jun-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	Hello, just moving my construction business off of Kiruna for this more convenient location, also ALO.


[10-Jun-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	I'll try and remember to pack a bit more RAT next time, and other stuff.  Though there is barely anything to contribute, nice being on a small planet.


[10-Jun-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	yeah it's easy to maintain


[10-Jun-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Will you be putting down SMEs?


[10-Jun-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The COGC is Metallurgy, which I'm hoping to keep


[10-Jun-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	The native extraction rates are so high already, along with experts, that I found the COGC helped me maximise otherwise-expensive SMEs


[10-Jun-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	This would also support construction as the middle step between ore and fabs


[10-Jun-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And, depending on your existing capacity, I am throwing _a lot_ of LST off UV-072c LM, which is only a few hops away


[10-Jun-22 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	Oh yeah, plenty of SMEs, gotta feed the PP2s some how.  Speaking of which, how are we doing on building up a settler labor pool?


[10-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I‚Äôve put down a single FS, and happy to help establish more


[10-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Maybe we‚Äôll need and INF?


[10-Jun-22 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	An INF would be nice.  I threw my bit in.


[10-Jun-22 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Awesome, I‚Äôll bring BSE, TRU, and upkeep items on the next ship. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think I can beat the next POPR though as it‚Äôs very soon

**neke86**:	I went star support post Steam launch and thought hell why nog


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	not*


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'm considering changing the COGC to Metallurgy, the extraction rate here is so astronomically high that it's un-required. A metallurgy COGC will allow me to build 8 EXT + 8 SME right here and output a significant number of AL instead of ALO to ship. I don't think this negatively effects any of you three but would like to hear your opinion regardless


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Oh that‚Äôs interesting


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	i don‚Äôt really have the permits, struggling to source the AAR for my twelfth


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

**neke86**:	Hi @NunnuHEE


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Have you come for FEO? I've just started listing it dirt cheap on the LM


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	in case anyone is crazy enough to come here for FEO


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Will do ALO as well


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Putting cheap C on the market @Ryst ??


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	that‚Äôs how i started but then efca stopped posting to it


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	@Ryst I'd like to keep Metallurgy please, the extraction rates are so high here, the metallurgy allows for better exploitation of that rate here on site, and minimises the requirements for shipping


[23-Jun-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	not least, I've just put down a huge fleet of smelters, and the extractors that are half that number are still too much - even with no cogs!

**neke86**:	If the native+expert extraction is not enough, potentially we could arrange to sell ore cheaply among ourselves


[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	IF that's something you'd be amenable too, let me know, I already have hundreds of units too many

[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Is anyone able to sell me 77 RAT, but of a workforce emergency I'm afraid


[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I'll leave an ad on the LM in case my luck is in


[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	but if someone has it lying about!


[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	And I've just pushed the SST back out to 30 days of supply


[23-Jun-22 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jun-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Has anyone got 28 MCG for COGC in two days?


[25-Jun-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-22 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-22 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	can sell replenishment RAT to cover your stock if you can help but don‚Äôt want to break your own logistics doing so

[20-Jul-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Imagine having so much cash you have HSE lying about hahahah


[20-Jul-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Haha :D


[20-Jul-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I did think you guys had that much money


[20-Jul-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I do but HSE a bit hard to find. I have INS and MCG, I can fly an HSE in on my next flight? would be within 48h


[20-Jul-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I have a ship incoming as well, i picked up the last one from Benten just to be safe


[20-Jul-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	alright


[20-Jul-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	Just thought I'd ask here first


[20-Jul-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I really don't like the durability aspect of this game


[20-Jul-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	certainly worth checking, I have three planets needing HSE so I store them centrally on Katoa


[20-Jul-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I mean, it‚Äôs fun I just wish it was better implemented


[20-Jul-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	I basically always dislike durability mechanics, it killed BotW for me


[20-Jul-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jontos**:	In this game I forget about it until my factories break down :D


[20-Jul-22 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	On each of my base screens, I create a specially named chat buffer. Then I drop in a date to review degradation levels and ship in replacement parts. A few other random comments also get added when there's something specific that I want to remember. Works quite well.


[20-Jul-22 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I use the FIO building functionality


[20-Jul-22 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	but you gotta remember to check


[20-Jul-22 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I use that functionality too. The date on my base screen buffers is the reminder.

[06-Aug-22 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Welcome, it‚Äôs hostile planet but a quiet and friendly community :)


[06-Aug-22 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I‚Äôve setup and maintain the infrastructure and COGC, no need to contribute


[07-Aug-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Digable**:	I was wondering how that works, I can contribute some if needed


[07-Aug-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	it would be nice if you have a tiny amount of inputs in reserve in case i forget, but that‚Äôs all for now!


[07-Aug-22 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Digable**:	roger!


[16-Aug-22 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Cheap ALO on the LM for anyone wanting a bit more from their Geidi Prime infrastructure :)


[23-Aug-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I haven't had a smelter before. What kind of ratio of extractors to smelters is working well on Geidi?


[23-Aug-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	depends on your experts but i run 2 SME per EXT


[23-Aug-22 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Good to know, I'd thought it would be the opposite ratio. Thanks!


[23-Aug-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	do the maths for your base but yeah that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm running


[24-Aug-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iridium**:	I do my smelting on Gibson actually where my partner consumes it... it's more mass efficient to ship the ALO than to ship the resulting AL and I'm not burning HSE keeping SMEs alive


[24-Aug-22 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Whereas my Gibson base is 100% WELs and I don't have space anywhere else for SMEs :D


[25-Aug-22 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I was going to build a PP2 and maybe PP3 on Geidi eventually to try and add value before shipping it out.


[25-Aug-22 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I‚Äôd be an occasional customer of that if you did (and had cycles)


[25-Aug-22 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	Can even bring LST here in bulk occasionally


[25-Aug-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	That would be super handy, probably a week or two until I get the PP2 built.


[25-Aug-22 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you setup a STO I can bring it whenever you like, just don‚Äôt have the space myself to store it

[14-Oct-22 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-22 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	If you place 500t shipping ads at say, 1000 CIS each to Benten, with 10-20 days on them, I'll get them moved off eventually for you


[14-Oct-22 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Oct-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**BlueHeeler**:	Good bye neke.


[17-Feb-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Do we need to have a tax increase and/or cover supplies now Neke is gone?


[17-Feb-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have been bringing some and will bring more but I don't want this to become a chore. Right now the tax income is just under 8000 per week. I would prefer if everyone just contribute when they can and we can see how it works out over time.


[17-Feb-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Is it worth letting the infirmary lapse to see what impact it has? My quick calcs at BEN prices have the CoGC at 1k/day, the Infirmary at 5300/day and the safety station at 3900/day.


[18-Feb-23 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Felmer**:	maybe we can drop the STR and SUN. Makes it less a chore and I¬¥m not sure if needed anyway


[20-Feb-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	filled DW+OFF for SST and INF. I assume SST and INF will work with only 2 items filled. I brought another 500 OFF onsite, so I can continue to fill DW and OFF from time to time as needed


[20-Feb-23 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	For TEC+ENG I would not contribute anything. Whoever requires them here, should be able contribute upkeep himself


[20-Feb-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks for the supplies. I will be bringing some SUN, STR, TUB, OFF and DW tomorrow.


[20-Feb-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Or, rather later today.


[20-Feb-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Maybe you should not contribute SUN+STR like Felmer wrote and try how it works without filling them


[20-Feb-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Just keep some onsite if we loose pop, but I agree with Felmer that SUN+STR should not be necessary


[20-Feb-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Ok, I will keep them on site and not commit them. We will see what happens.


[06-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	As mentioned before and with current high unemployment rates, you can reduce the POPI inputs for SST, INF, PAR


[06-Apr-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I would try to fill only 1 item next time and maybe add a second only if needed


[06-Apr-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	It is just a waste of money at the moment


[06-Apr-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	No offense, just a hint


[06-Apr-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I only put stuff in the Safety Station and the Infirmary and I don't buy it one of my bases makes it with spare cycles. I will stop putting in DW and see what happens. I get 6-7K in taxes each week so it isn't costing me ver much.

**JamesHart**:	lol, nice I see some very profitable LM sales in you near future


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Did I just post it on the LM!  Indeed I did :P


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	oh shoot


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	nicely done. good luck.

[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	and delete the add


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	oh! i didn't knew that panel :P  thanks !


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	had to do that a few times lol


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	James... are you buying ?


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	unfortunately my neer term cash is already spoken for and I also produce FE for my Factories :D


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	but you are doing exactly what I would do


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	when your costs are labour after setup things are cheap to make


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i know


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i really overproduced, and my ships now can't keep up without an upgrade


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and i'm stuck


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	especially on a place where the bias is for the smelters :D


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	damn. you could offer hauling contracts for folk to take them to Benten station.


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	that would be a great idea :P  i always forget about the hauling of goods


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	only 65 per smaller ship cargo hold for fe


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	so does add to cost


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah, imma do batches of 15, i guess... so there's more chance to have someone haul some away


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	do you have an idea for the cost ?


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	has its risks of course, but helps if you are running out of space. you could always build out a Staorage Facility and add 5000 to capacity


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i could... but last I checked the Storage Facility cost like... 150K


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	hmmmm


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	it's easily attainable now :P


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	it wasn't when i first checked


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	I woluld offer a hauling contract starting at about 2k it is guite the trip so it is only right to cover their fuel fees at least


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	once you start building up your empire things get relatively cheaper


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	Giedi Prime is especially expensive though


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	good luck and congrats


[08-Sep-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	thanks a lot for your ideas, much obliged :P

**JamesHart**:	tyvm. :D more space lol, (also bought a warehouse)


[09-Sep-23 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	would you need a bigger warehouse here? I could just upgrade WAR level, so you can rent more per company


[09-Sep-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	with this expansion I suspect I'll be good for a while. need to do more location development. this is a relatively new location for me :D thanks for lthe thought


[09-Sep-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'd buy a fourth storage space if it was available


[09-Sep-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	just added a Storage Facility, in leu of a Smelter.. for now. Building more components at Gibson. I see you are in Gibson also Yeyland-Wutani. Good system combination


[09-Sep-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah :P  one puts out the metal, the other forges into prefabs, and it helps me grow my production


[09-Sep-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Just posted a request for 100 FEO at 42 CIS each.  It's at the halfway point of the spread on the Benten CX!


[11-Sep-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	accepted and tried to deliver. looks like you are having space issues again ?


[11-Sep-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	NOT AT ALL :P


[11-Sep-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Sep-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	sounds good. reach out when I can deliver .


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	in private or here ?


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	either way


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	kk


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	My ship needs repairing before i can bring back the stuff to build my storage


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	Just wanted to make sure you knew I wasnt deliberately not giving you the ore


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	aaah. I can understand that. if you have to you can extend the contract if it takes that long


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	it probably needs time to cool down from the smelter anyway


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	nah, in 2h16 i'll finish extracting the ore I need for a contract, clear my storage, make money off it to buy the required ship plates, trigger the delivery, send my ship over for my 6 new buildings and go to bed :P


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	it's all squeezed at once


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	lol, definitely sounds familiar


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	first time repairing a ship... is it the same as a building?  access the UI when the material is available at base and click repair ?


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	let me know if you have a regular need for ore. we can make arrangements if you do


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	it was only a one-time faction contract at the same time as a storage cinch, but thanks for the offer


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	its a game of cooperation as much as anything :D


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	after building my base upgrade, i'm thinking of upgrading my ships to allow more stuff to be moved around


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I was undergoing a phase of rapid expension and got stuck with too much iron :P  I appreciate your help in this regard


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	very smart move. if you dont already have a contact for ship building I can forward on a couple that may be able to help


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I'll let you know if I need anything. Feel free to let me know


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I tought it was only setup a blueprint, buy the required parts, fly to a shipyard and click upgrade ?


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	yeas and no. a few of the members of my company build most of the parts and may be able to extend some discounts ikf you get it all in house.


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i see - interesting :P


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	also, how did you land a spot on katoa ?


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	well, not ready for the upgrade just yet. I zapped a cool half mil on this base upgrade


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	Katoa was my first planet. generally first bases can get on any of the starter planets even if already otherwise full


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	\diddnt know that till after i got there


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	haaaa


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i see


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	the population there does go in cycles and openings do happen


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	great for manufacturing


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i'm looking at the planet info, and it says there's -2 plots available.  I have no idea what the +76 means


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	hmm....


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i'd rather not setup manufacturing on uponor :P


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	perhapse they are adding plots to it ? (p[ure speculation)


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeah


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	still, I could open a warehouse, place the stuff there to open a new base, and as soon as it frees i get it


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I arsked in global


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	oh, very nice. I'll have to try that some time


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yeaaahhh...


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	the number there is ghost plots... so people that settled their first base there... they need to be at zero before another plots gets freed when an inactive player gets scavenged


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	Can you attempt to deliver again ?


[11-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks neke I will, but so far I have not had any trouble keeping things stocked. I make all the POPI stuff on Etherwind and drop it off on my way back to Katoa.

**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I can help if you want, I normally do one or two runs a week


[16-Oct-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	and most times I have some spaces left


[16-Oct-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	You can if you like but you can also leave it to those of us that are more developed. Do what ever you are comfortable with.


[16-Oct-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I get around 18K per week in taxes. That pays towards the POPI but like I said earlier, I make all of the consumables for the Safety Station and the Infirmary. I ddon't think the Wildlife Park and the Art Gallery are necessary and do not contribute to them.


[16-Oct-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	It is my opinion that it is too expensive to build and maintain higher process on this planet. Most of us just mine and process Auminum and Iron.


[16-Oct-23 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I was refering to shipping some of your stuff


[16-Oct-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Oh, I see. Well I have two large ships (2000t) and one small one (500t) so I almost never need shipping but thanks for the offer.

[20-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	well, sounds about right


[20-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	haul my stuff, buy my fuel. oh and make a little something for yourself while you are at it


[20-Oct-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i do :P


[30-Oct-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i feel safer already


[30-Oct-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks @xensored for the upgrade.


[31-Oct-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yw, looks like we're loosing PIOs even with 3 upkeep materials for SST filled. So the SST upgrade will help. Let's see if it is enough, may be a 3rd lvl can be more effective and you can stop SUN then. But let's see, in case needed I can upgrade it again


[31-Oct-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	yw?  as in me ?


[31-Oct-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	He was saying you're welcome to me.


[31-Oct-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	oh, didn't know that acronym


[31-Oct-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Could have been 'you wish', but that didn't fit. You're welcome is the most obvious especially following a thank you.


[31-Oct-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	@xensored - let me do the next upgrade if you think we need it. I am three quarter through a base upgrade (21) so I am a little strapped for CIS or FABS at the moment. I make all types of FABS so after I finish with my base upgrade I can put together the FABS for another Safety Station upgrade.


[01-Nov-23 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	How much CIS do you beed


[01-Nov-23 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	need


[01-Nov-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	yeah can also contribute CIS or fabs, let me know


[01-Nov-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	so we want to upgrade the Safety Station from 2 to 3? thats the plan?


[01-Nov-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	if so i can do that


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I don't know enough to say whether we need to or not. @xensored suggested that we may need to do that to stop Pioneers from leaving. He just did an upgrade and said we may need another. I said if he decided that we need another then I would handle it. I say wait and see if we need it and then we can all pitch in.


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	@neke86 - it is not about CIS. I would rather make than buy FABS. But as I said just now I am still waiting to see if we actually do need to have another upgrade.


[01-Nov-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Do not get me wrong. I appreciate the willingness to pitch in.


[01-Nov-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am not short of Pioneers. Are other people having trouble getting workers?


[01-Nov-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Nov-23 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Nov-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	that's what I tell them :)


[01-Nov-23 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	Sorry @Mac-Flar but I must disuade you of that unsusrtainable notion. There is no such thing as  coffee being bad for someone. It is the ONLY thing in existance. We should all bow down to the great Coffee Urn in the sky. The elixier we have been given from on high !!!!!!!!!


[02-Nov-23 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	@JamesHart coffee is not bad :) but it is much better mixed with hot cocoa.


[02-Nov-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	ok, well i upgraded it anyway, its there if we need it. it was half done anyway, someone else had contributed half the fabs already

[24-Nov-23 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-23 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	of course they did


[24-Nov-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	those are high prices item


[24-Nov-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	speaking of, i'm thinking of upping my MHL production


[24-Nov-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	yep. and I am able to go a few hundred below market low since I make them


[24-Nov-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	nice. it is a good product


[24-Nov-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JamesHart**:	I wont object if you want to sell them on planet lol


[24-Nov-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	i might let you take on the shipping and sell to you on MHL


[24-Nov-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	on *Gibson


[24-Nov-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Nov-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	c'mon guys with your LM ads buying ores you can't store!


[26-Nov-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Bastablon d might be a nice place to sell mhl as it is agriculture with no fertility


[26-Nov-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I mean, if you make MHL here and plan to sell them for less than CI1 b/c of less shipping, I'll buy them here. This is basically in between all of my Ag planets, so it would be easy enough for me to distribute them where I need them to be...

[31-Dec-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I would probably be down for more warehouse space


[31-Dec-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I haven't even started production yet and both base and warehouse is maxed xD


[31-Dec-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If my calculations are correct the cost would be: 144 BBH/BDE, 72 BSE, 1800 MCG, 120 TRU. I can help with everything but TRU


[31-Dec-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	That's to get 4 units


[31-Dec-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	I've got a lot of TRU


[31-Dec-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Dec-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neke86**:	(just not here, yet)

[31-Dec-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'm currently running production for repairs at the moment


[31-Dec-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	May be a stupid question but why don't you add STO to your site? Is your area max'd out? Seems to me it would be cheaper in the long run.


[31-Dec-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I personally have no use for Warehouse. In my opinion it is for people who do not have property on Giedi Prime.


[31-Dec-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I would hope he has one xD But I can see where having a full space base and not enough space to add a second one can be an issue


[31-Dec-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yeyland-Wutani**:	I maxed out, I have a storage, but I also consume warehouses


[06-Jan-24 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jan-24 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jan-24 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jan-24 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Feb-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Shouldn't need DW but I threw in some for the next 3 days until I can get SOI on planet


[11-Feb-24 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Might make some UTS here and there as well just to throw some culture in the mix


[11-Feb-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I started an Engineer Immigration Program to attract 50 new engineers. Let me know if this helps.


[12-Feb-24 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Awesome thank you :) I'll look at the stats and such when I get home.


[12-Feb-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I believe those take affect next cycle so it still gives me a few days to get UTS and SOI dropped in the upkeep. I produce my own SOI so it's no biggy


[18-Feb-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nutnic**:	can someone bring it to me from giedi?


[19-Feb-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Bring what?... I'm probably heading this way in the next day or 2


[20-Feb-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I forgot to mention I brought UTS and forgot the SOI but I have my required workforce at the moment thanks to the boost. Thank you :) I'll make another trip down here soon and bring more POPI stuff


[21-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	lol well I need 500 Techs and 200 Engineers so I can probably help with POPI stuff as well


[21-Feb-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	We'll see after the next report


[21-Feb-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	As governor I supply the POPI for the Safety Station and the Infirnary. I will not be contributing to the Art Gallery there simply isn't enough taxation to pay for it.


[21-Feb-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I already paid 80K out of my pocket for the Engineer Immigration Progam (50 Engineers).


[21-Feb-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I personally don't think it wise to have processes that require 500 engineers on this planet.


[21-Feb-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Creating and maintaining processes on this planet is very expensive.


[21-Feb-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I will be surprised if you can turn a profit after building, repairing you processand as well as supporting the Art Gallery.


[21-Feb-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	UTS he could make easily enough here, presumably he is working on something with high margins.


[21-Feb-24 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I threw an ASM up here ages ago when I was building the parts to upgrade my starter ships, only bothered with Tech though since it was a short term project.


[22-Feb-24 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll start with UTS and see how it goes. If it's still short I'm down for providing DEC as well though I'll probably have to start making more to fund POPI and my own needs xD


[22-Feb-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If any upgrades are needed for my wife and I, we will fund it. Again, thank you for the immigration program! It jump started my own FAL production


[22-Feb-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If you're overly concerned about the 80k for it, send me a golden DW contract and I'll pay it back to you


[22-Feb-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Once we get into the high margin goodies, we won't be doing them here anyways. This is a setup and forget planet to feed the higher margin goodies elsewhere ;)


[22-Feb-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The 80K is no burden but it is not covered by taxes and is of no benefit to what I use this planet for.


[22-Feb-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Bases on this planet are expensive to build and maintain. Unless you have large ships you will be spend all of you time bring in consumables. I shudder to think what that will be for 500 Engineers. COF, DW, RAT, OVE, PWO, KOM, EXO, REP, PT, ALE, MED, SC, HMS, SCN, GIN, VG, HSS and PDA.


[22-Feb-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
***BlueHeeler** deleted this message.*


[22-Feb-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	You will spend millions to maintain the Art Gallery. I make DEC but I would hate to have to buy it. I maintain the Art Gallery on Nemesis - because I wanted Technicians for my Orchard.


[22-Feb-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I had to add a handful of processes in order to provide the consumables for the Art Gallery - often you cannot get some of them from the CX (like HOG).


[22-Feb-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I only have EXT and SML here and do most of my Manufacturing on Katoa. But Proxion, Umbra and Etherwind help out as well.


[22-Feb-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I hope it works out for you. I would be willing to do another Engineer Migration Program for you.


[22-Feb-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Sorry, I did not rremember correctly - 500 Technicians and 200 Engineers. I only have 200 Technicians and 90 Engineers on Katoa.


[22-Feb-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I'm loving the experiment, I thought I was ambitious having Technicians on a solo planet, so this is giving me a good insight into Engineers if I ever got so bold.


[22-Feb-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	All of my current work effort is for Base Upgrade 22.


[22-Feb-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I agree that it will be intersting to see. Which I why I am willing to pitch in a little bit.


[22-Feb-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	In theory I'm building a fleet of new ships, but then realised I'd bitten off more than I can chew and haven't downsized the plan yet.


[22-Feb-24 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I enlarged my two initial ships to 2000 ton and built one more 500 ton ship. So far this is working out for me. Often the big ships are running without being full.


[22-Feb-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I upgraded the starters to 1000m3 then had a vision of building 2 x 500m2, 2 new 1000m3 and 2 x 2000m3 ships. Except it is all a bit much and I get by with the 2 x 1000m3 for now anyway, so really a pair of 500m3 ought to compliment things quite well.


[22-Feb-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Plus the lack of product liquidity frustrates me, so I wanted to build enough parts for another few ships so they were on the market for anyone else trying to build their own ships.


[22-Feb-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Ya, I was headed that way as well while I was building ship stuff, but I changed my mind and now work a PREFAB line. AFABS have an excellent return and fairly good demand. I sell to Benton, Antares and Moria CX. I have just added building WRK, HAB and LU Unit Prefabs, but the demand for them is low..


[22-Feb-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Yeah, I've a single PP4 and sell what I don't use, the profits are good.


[22-Feb-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I still make CHA, BHP and SSC. And now that stupid FLP that has been added to ship repairs. I have a Metalist Studio and make MFK, SFK and UTS.


[22-Feb-24 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I just build a Metalist Studio here and find it bewildering the profit margins my spreadsheet says the MFK/SFK/UTS etc have.


[22-Feb-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I use all that I make, so I don't know what the margin is like. I used to have one on Geidi Prime but moved it to Katoa. I have been thinking of bringing it back though.


[22-Feb-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Probably a bit insane, but each process needs to be independently profitable in my calculations. I put a cleanroom here on Giedi for convenience... then a second... I really need an electronics planet to move them to.


[22-Feb-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	My electronics is spread around where ever there is room.


[22-Feb-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Good idea, the margins mean they work for an odds-and-ends base with capacity.


[23-Feb-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I like to think of it as an experiment lol Good thinking. If it doesn't work out, I'm not really out anything but time and curiosity and we'll just move the higher tier stuff :)


[23-Feb-24 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	It's all AST/FET production xD Like Aries said though, we have no issues funding the workforce.


[25-Feb-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	I'm still short tech/eng so I'll go ahead and send some goodies to fund the art gallery and wildlife park. We'll see where were at after that. I'll probably stay here for awhile so do you mind if I fund upgrades for both as well?


[25-Feb-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Maybe the Art Cafe as well


[25-Feb-24 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Worse comes to shove when we move, you just downgrade the levels as needed


[27-Feb-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekeMorrin**:	Hi all


[28-Feb-24 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Heya


[08-Mar-24 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Going over the financials, it is in my best interest to go ahead and upgrade and supply POPI for the PAR and ART at the moment. With corp pricing and myself and Aries produce most of whats required so our daily upkeep cost is extremely low here


[08-Mar-24 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	I'll have to play with the calculator a bit to see how many upgrade levels we'd need but I'll fully fund and support them until (or if) we move


[08-Mar-24 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	If we were to move it wouldn't be for months


[08-Mar-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I wouldn't do several levels. Just proceed with immigration programs and pay the gov for it. then start with one level of each building and fill it with 1-2 upkeep materials and have a look if that's sufficient to maintain the TEC/ENG population. It should be okay


[08-Mar-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Proceed with TEC immigration first. You should ask the gov for another  program asap before POPR. Next weeks TEC will grow natural with happiness of more than 70%. From next week you should run ENG immigration programs until pop is filled


[08-Mar-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	1 to max. 2 level of parc and gallery should be sufficient to maintain TEC/ENG in the future and avoid they leave the planets


[08-Mar-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I don't exactly see the point in an immigration program though. I was planning to just upgrade the Art Gallery and Wildlife park 1 level and fund more of the requirements and go from there. After last weeks POPR we're still only sitting at 20% tech & eng


[08-Mar-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Which I *should* be able to get a ship here to do all that before the next POPR.


[08-Mar-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Immigration gets you guaranteed people while you sort out happiness etc.


[08-Mar-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	But only at 50 workers? For example my wife alone is short 400 tech and almost 200 eng


[08-Mar-24 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I mean if @blueheeler is down I don't mind funding an immigration program. It doesn't cost that much. I could send a couple things to market and easily pay for it


[08-Mar-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	TEC Immigration Program is 50K and ENG is 80K. I receive a little less than 30K per week in taxes and I supply all of the POPI for the Infirmary and Safety Station. As I have said before, putting TEC and ENG on this planet is not cost effective and since I have been unable to discourage you,  if you provide me with the CIS credits I will initiate the programs. Send me a contract to buy 1 unit of ALO or FEO for 50K or 80K and I will initiate your programs.


[08-Mar-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I will personally not financially support an effort to bring TEC and ENG to the planet.


[08-Mar-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I created and and provide for the Art Gallery on Nemesis. This is a planet that is suited for TEC and ENG, though I only have PIO, SET and TEC.


[08-Mar-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	You cannot currently buy the HOG and MHP consumables for the Art Gallery in Benton CX, so unless you have the facilities to make them you will struggle to maintain an Art Gallery.


[08-Mar-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Looking at the numbers, higher margins could stimulate production, but right now I make more off SF (which is simple with a lot of turnover) than I would MHP.


[09-Mar-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	The lack of confidense is unsettling xD @blueheeler contr sent for tech program with a little extra. We'll keep track of all current levels and provide full funding for increased levels and upkeep for the tech/eng as well as throw in a few things like OFF,DW, etc as extra little help when I catch them not full filled yet


[09-Mar-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Also, cost effectiveness keeps getting brought up. Don't worry about our cost effectiveness ;) Some things mean more than a few CIS. With KAWA backing and support for pushing ASM and SKF here cost isn't an issue


[09-Mar-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	If you need help with a little extra cash flow if taxes aren't enough, feel free to DM me


[09-Mar-24 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	I would like to increase the level (by 1) of the SST, INF, PAR, and ART. I can fund all materials as well as some OFF, DW, and TUB. The PAR and ART I will contribute fully for upkeep


[09-Mar-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	All of these numbers based off Archiel's Gov Helper. This should stabilize inf deficit as well as level out the cap on Tech/Eng.


[09-Mar-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Technician Imigration program initiated - for 100 new technicians. Starts in 7 days.


[09-Mar-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Thank you :)


[10-Mar-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	wf looking better this week. I'll send you a contract for the eng immigration program in a few days for the next cycle


[10-Mar-24 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	okay. I do not need the extra credits, so just provide me with the actual costs. It is not that I do not appreciate the gesture...


[10-Mar-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Very well


[10-Mar-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Mar-24 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Thank you


[13-Mar-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I'm going to do a upgrade to the Infirmary, as well, in a day or so.


[13-Mar-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	You're welcome, btw.


[13-Mar-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	If you need some OFF or TUB lemme know


[13-Mar-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I will, thanks. I have lots right now though.


[14-Mar-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Alrighty. Hubby produces both so if you ever need any I'm sure he'd be happy to contribute xD @ariesnation

***MarkBlaireau** joined.*


[15-Mar-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I can provide your WOR and DEC for the Art Gallery, will ship them somewhen today


[15-Mar-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Cool beans, DEC is a bit slow at the moment so we're trying to get a few more buildings going to supply a few planets POPI. I know Aries was going to work on crafting our own WOR but I don't think he's started that production yet. Something about inbalance to the PSM/PSL in his planner xDD


[15-Mar-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	But I am slowly adding POPI each week to see where the balance is at. Next POPR comes out in less than 2 days and we just supplied a few more upkeep mats than we did last week to see where that puts us


[15-Mar-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	I would love to get more people here on Giedi so I think in the long run this is a nice shift addition


[15-Mar-24 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Ah thank you @xensored :) Ya I haven't moved things around yet to build the WOR so it is greatly appreciated!


[15-Mar-24 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I have HAB's cooking now it just takes awhile xD Almost 2 days per HAB and need 6


[16-Mar-24 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I have also 4 HAB lying on Gibson. Can ship them with next ship in approx 2d and contribute them aswell


[16-Mar-24 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	so you have to produce only 2 yourself


[16-Mar-24 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have 2 HABs on Katoa that I will donate. I also have 4 WOR that I would be willing to donate - how many of the WOR do you need.


[16-Mar-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	You guys are awesome :) xensored took care of the WOR already but we already have 2 HAB so however yall wanna split that up. I'm guessing but it's not guarenteed that we may need to up the level of the Art Gallery and Wildlife Park a single more time but that won't be needed for a few more weeks. We're slowly adding upkeep and levels each POPR until it's leveled out with minimum input


[16-Mar-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Next POPR will be out tomorrow. Then we plan to add more upkeep materials (SOI, UTS, PFE, and DEC). Then we'll see how levels go and go from there


[16-Mar-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	I'm hoping all that will get us close to leveling out. Then struggling for a few weeks as immigration naturally comes in to go positive


[16-Mar-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Oh and FOD though I'd rather not as we're not farmers so we'd have to buy that from someone xD


[16-Mar-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	In 10 hrs and 38m I will arrive at Giedi Prime with 2 HAB and 4 WOR. I will contribute then when I am on line later on.


[17-Mar-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
***amanda405** left.*


[17-Mar-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Whatever's left I'll probably send a ship tonight or in the morning for what's left. POPR looking pretty good this week :)


[17-Mar-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have contributed what I had on hand for the Art Gallery and the Wildlife Park., though I have one more WORK here that can be used for another upgrade if you decide to.


[17-Mar-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Cool beans, thank ya! 2 HAB on the way to Giedi. So just need 2 more for next weeks POPR. I've also got DEC on the way as well to fill upkeep


[18-Mar-24 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I can send the 2 HABs with a ship that will start today evening


[18-Mar-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Cool beans, no rush. Still got 6 days before the next POPR :)


[22-Mar-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Just noticed I forgot to split the DEC between PAR and ART so I'll fix that next cycle lol I should make enough to cover both on a regular basis but that may be one of those materials that will just be short every now and then


[22-Mar-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Next POPR comes out in less than 2 days and I have high hopes :) It's really close to having everything covered so I think as long as I keep filling the upkeep it'll even out to provide enough workers soon


[22-Mar-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	To note, we're not providing MHP, HOG, DW, or FOD for either place but the goal is to become stable without those things. I may throw DW every now and then but will just be when I have extras laying around


[24-Mar-24 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	POPR is out for the week and we're covered on Tech's :) Engineers are still short so we'll probably continue to fund the immigration unless you need to run other programs. For now we'll just continue to fund POPI and see how the next couple weeks go


[24-Mar-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	As far as I am aware, only you are changing the status quo. Thus there are no other programs that need to be run. I will run another Engineer Immigration program when you tell me to.


[24-Mar-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	It never occurred to me that you would get any benefit without providing all of the consumables for the Art Gallery.


[24-Mar-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Ya there's no point in providing 100% of the upkeep as long as the level is high enough to support part of it. It's what I do on JS. I only supply SOI and OFF for everything


[24-Mar-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Only reason I'm supplying the PFE and DEC is bc it's not my planet to go upgrading 3 or 4 levels xD


[24-Mar-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Looking at the sheet calculator, the only thing in a deficit is Safety and it's not by far so all should be good on the current path. I just need patience to wait for workers to come in :)


[24-Mar-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Well I keep Infirmary and Safety Station topped up all the time. Does that meen I need to do something with Hospital or Emergency Center? When I reluctantly became governor I just kept doing what Neke used to do, which as far as I can tell is all that we ever needed to keep pioneers around.


[24-Mar-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	My mandate from the people at the time was just to keep taxes at a minimum.


[24-Mar-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Nope everything should be good. Numbers look good and the deficit isn't very high. Do you use Archiel's Governor Helper spreadsheet?


[24-Mar-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We probably won't move any time soon so I have no problems keeping the higher tier infrastructure funded. Especially since I make most of it myself. If we ever move you can always drop the level down so it's not using those resources any more. Then in the future if others want it then nobody has to fund the upgrades since it's already done.


[24-Mar-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'm a firm believer in keeping taxes low or non-existent! I'm working towards making taxes on my JS base practically free


[24-Mar-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If it ever becomes to much we'd be more than happy to take over as governor here so you don't have to worry about it ;)


[24-Mar-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Also I apologize for "changing the status quo" xD I like this planet and it's convenient having a metallurgy base for ship building so close to Ben


[24-Mar-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We mainly only use it here for the ASM's but I threw a couple UPF bc I have room. Something that won't run 24/7


[24-Mar-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	No I do not use AGH spreadsheet. I have no real interest in being a governor. Someone tried to take over the planet and those of us that had been there from the beginning did not want that to happen. Od those of us I was the only one who was not already a governor so I chose to run against that player with the mandate from the others to keep the takes at a minimum with least effort on my part.

[24-Mar-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Should have proof read it.


[24-Mar-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	You are alrady a governor. If someone wants to run against me with the same mandate (min taxes) the people can decide by voting.


[24-Mar-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	exensored (one of the original players) keeps the COGC supplied, BTW.


[24-Mar-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We may have to talk about this and try our hand at running. I personally am 100% down for the least amount of taxes possible and take over upkeep/CoGC. I‚Äôll look when I get to the pc but are taxes as low as they‚Äôll go already?


[24-Mar-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	As an example, all fees are set to 25 on my JS planet bc that's as low as they go. I'm running SS and INF multiple levels above what's needed so I don't have to supply things like DW, SUN, etc. I produce my own OFF as well as produce all the CoGC materials myself so everything is just off the top. If I could make taxes free, I 100% would xD


[24-Mar-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have set all of the taxes as low as possible. The last amount of taxes received was 27,500 CIS.


[24-Mar-24 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I won't speak for xensored but I think he is okay with supplying COGC. It is never not provided.


[24-Mar-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Governor will be decided by election.


[24-Mar-24 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Giedi Prime is not located where the taxes can be 0 like Etherwind.


[24-Mar-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The planets that are white on the map can be set to 0.


[24-Mar-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh absolutely! Election is fair and square I meant maybe we can talk to you and see what you or your corp would want. KAWA is steadily growing known for our low taxes bc we produce literally everything in house. If this is something you don't like doing and it's just the motions we'd more than happily try to campaign and run for gov! :) But 100% agree it's up to the people and we don't want to step on your toes if this is what you like/want to do


[24-Mar-24 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	That we could probably move to a DM or discord (feel free to DM me on discord if you'd like, but it's not necessary). I'd just like to get you and your group/corps input on the situation.


[24-Mar-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I don't do Discord. My Corp's only purpose is to collect taxes so that they don't go to Castilo-Ito Mercantile.


[24-Mar-24 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Make your feelings known people. I will continue to run for Governor if an apponent raises taxes.


[25-Mar-24 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Keeping things as-is seems straight forward, most set up here as a low-tax planet without bells and whistles. Thanks BlueHeeler for stepping up and making things work well!


[25-Mar-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	You're right Verde! Absolutely nothing would change besides the face of the planet. All taxes and wh fees would stay as low as it can possibly go. The benefit to us taking over is mainly for us as we'd increase POPI levels to reduce the variation of upkeep needed. Nothing would change on the community side ;)


[25-Mar-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	You can already increase the POPI and supply the materials, what is your issue with the current system?


[25-Mar-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I let on that being governor was not something that I really wanted, that I accepted the position to keep another from taking it an raising the taxes. Everyone else at the time was already a governor somewhere else. I don't mind being governor but if someone wants to do it and will maintain minimal taxes then I would yield - always ready to retake the governorship if necessary. AriesServices is already a governor so I don't really know where he is going with this.


[25-Mar-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Where I'm going with this is KAWA taking over with the same morals and original goals so BlueHeeler doesn't have to anymore. I'm not sure how I feel dumping possibly millions into Giedi with someone else running it. I would be the backend always taking care of upgrades and all required upkeep that others wouldn't want to do but the goal would be to increase POPI to a point where only select materials would be needed. Specifically ones I produce purely for upkeep to maintain plenty of workers even at higher tiers for less variety of upkeep materials


[25-Mar-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I don't plan on leaving any time soon as its my main hub for WEL and ASMs and I'm a firm believer in keeping the taxes as non existent as possible. My track record with JS-601c can be my standing ground and proof as I've had the minimum tax and wh amounts as well as provided 100% of upkeep and CoGC since I took over for RNGZero


[25-Mar-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	And 100% if someone came in and raised taxes I'd vote against them as well ü§£


[25-Mar-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Consider that the majority of the people on this planet are happy with the status quo.


[25-Mar-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	How about this: if we have someone in here to run and they fail I'll make you a deal afterwards that would make it so all you had to do was be the face of Giedi and we'd take care of the rest ü§£


[25-Mar-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	All for the peoples vote so if it turned out like that I'm completely fine with it. Just would like to try that first as I don't necessarily feel completely comfortable going through upgrades and more upkeep while KAWA not the governor lol


[25-Mar-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We've got awhile anyways while we wait for workers to level out from the recent changes anyways :)


[25-Mar-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Well now you are just starting to annoy me. Tell your KAWA buddy to run against me again and see how he does. Clearly you are advocating for someone else. It was a KAWA person that forced us to get a governor in the first place.


[25-Mar-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Mar-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Alright I'll step away from talking about it. The main reason I even pushed the issue in the first place was because BH hinted at not wanting it. Otherwise I would've just straight talked to BH and worked out some kind of deal and not even went that route xD But anyways

[13-Jun-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-24 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Impressive! Nice work guys!


[14-Jun-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I don't have one ready either but I do have immediate plans and stuff in the queue to build a couple! I make most ship parts here so it's perfect. Thanks Verde!


[14-Jun-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Its funny, I had ambitions to build myself 5 ships in a big batch but downsized it to 75% of a single ship (buying the rest). Might give the extra ships another go in a few months once I see how it plays out (the new one is LHP rather than BHP and high accel compared to my upgraded starter ships).


[14-Jun-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'm hoping to have another 10 by the end of the year. I make most parts for them and what I don't make, I'll be making soon :)

**BlueHeeler**:	*supposed


[26-Jun-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	basicly the top 3 canidates become members of parliament, with the person with the most votes becoming governor


[26-Jun-24 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(actually top N canidates, but N=3 for giedi prime based on the number of bases here)


[26-Jun-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Is a person on the parliament with only their vote?


[26-Jun-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	sorry, i did'nt understand that.  ask again?


[26-Jun-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	oh, if a person only gets 1 vote (because they voted for themselves) can they still be a member of parliment?  yes, i think so in some cases


[26-Jun-24 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	That seems a bit strange. @wickskiracer could be numerous parlaiments.


[26-Jun-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	yeah.  a fairly big one, with 22 members


[27-Jun-24 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	KAWA is a corp but we have a lot more than 22. That‚Äôs just our members that don‚Äôt hold a seat of governing. There‚Äôs probably another 20 something that we have individual corps for tax collection purposes since we‚Äôre a governor :)

[04-Jul-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Looking at most of the new government features I won't be running next election as it seems kinda pointless to have a parliament on small planets. All it will do is hinder the governor :) My vote will continue to go for @BlueHeeler


[04-Jul-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I wish the documentation was updated to reflect how it all works. Like does BlueHeeler get 7 votes on a motion compared to your 2 (reflection proportion of votes received), or do you get one each? (like a traditional parliament where one member gets one vote)


[04-Jul-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Parliament on these small planets is really not meaningful at all. The votes mean nothing after the election has ended except for the top voted players become the new government.


[04-Jul-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	The point of it all is to have groups of people help manage and maintain balance via motions. Motions are used to say increase an infrastructure level, payout or donate taxes, etc. Governor (person with the most votes) has a tie breaker vote on motions but parliament as a whole each person is worth 1 vote on a motion


[04-Jul-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	On another planet there are 3 of us, with 2 seats. Two have nominated and voted for themselves so if I don't vote will get a seat each but it becomes a tie for governor so I'm curious to see what happens.


[04-Jul-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	So with only 2 of us governor has full power since my vote is guarenteed to be tie broken by the governor itself.


[04-Jul-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	The benefit to have 2 is say BlueHeeler wants to go on vacation, I can still create motions in his place if needed


[04-Jul-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Plus it keeps us safe from a hostile takeover if two people got elected to raise taxes and contract all the money to themselves (if it works that way).


[04-Jul-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'm actually not sure what happens with the ties during election voting. I haven't seen a tie for top spot happen yet. I've seen ties on the members of parliament and it seems like the result is a random chance. So if there's 3 seats and a 5 way tie it randomly selects 3 people for those seat


[04-Jul-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Right! I am in the same boat as Blueheeler though with wanting to keep all taxes and fees as close to free as possible so no worries here with that :)


[04-Jul-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	That is a good point though, maybe I should continue to run to keep that seat warm just in case


[04-Jul-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Yeah, just saying it creates a slight risk if nobody stands for the 2nd seat.


[04-Jul-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We wouldn't want a random hopping in and taking over


[04-Jul-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Probably not too likely as you have to have a base here already, but could be a risk on highly occupied planets.


[04-Jul-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	So it looks like Giedi is eligible for a 3 seat parliament size so keeping 2 of us (BlueHeeler and myself) in a seat would ensure keeping everything as is


[04-Jul-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll throw my name in for now for the next running while I continue to test the new features and see how it works


[04-Jul-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I've got over 2 weeks to withdraw anyways


[04-Jul-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I think its nice having a backup who knows how things work just in case.


[04-Jul-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I am also always willing to take over (and maintain the current goals that BlueHeeler has kept) but would only do so on a community vote. If I were to take over as governor I would officially take up fulfilling all upkeep and CoGC and would be more than happy to have BlueHeeler stay on parliament as a security measure :)


[04-Jul-24 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Brokkraf would be my stand to show that the past year I've kept taxes and fees as low as they go and would have the same intentions here. So if anything were to happen, I would be more than happy to step in :)


[04-Jul-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Will be nice once the wiki gets updated with all the new features :)


[04-Jul-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am interested in taking a back seat. Please make your wishes know by voting for whom ever you want to be governor.


[04-Jul-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Works for me, the community is who's important :) Hopefully we can get a chance to test out some of these features as well with both of us in government


[04-Jul-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I took on the role when Neke left because no one else could. But governing is not really my thing. It has been easy on Giedi Prime so I will continue if you want me to but AriesNation has expressed interest in taking a larger role and I would support that.


[04-Jul-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-24 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Okay


[08-Jul-24 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oops meant for that to go in a DM with BH xDD But ya that's what I expect to happen since majority didn't vote yes


[08-Jul-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Just something I couldn't test on Brokkraf since I'm the gov


[08-Jul-24 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Gov would tie break meaning if he's the only one that votes yes between us it should pass


[09-Jul-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I'm glad your feeling things out. I am run ragged right now with repairs - just finishing up I think.


[09-Jul-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	All good, Giedi is pretty well sustained with infrastructure so we shouldn't really have anything to do unless a bunch of people build


[09-Jul-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Thats interesting, looks like if the other MP does nothing it becomes an abstain after 24hrs and the motion passed.


[09-Jul-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh wow... I'm guessing that is the fail safe for when a gov goes on vacation a backup may still be present and be able to do the duties


[09-Jul-24 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	*For instance


[09-Jul-24 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Yep, does mean MPs need to be on the ball. One dodgy MP proposing a nice payment to themselves and if the other(s) don't notice, it could slip through.


[09-Jul-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I did not explicitly chose abstain.


[09-Jul-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	*choose


[09-Jul-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I want edit capability for chat


[09-Jul-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	But more than that I would like the devs to fix the flight control slider.


[10-Jul-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	It should automatically choose abstain after the time expires which is nice. And edit capabilities would be amazing!


[10-Jul-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We're all going to be thrown off when they finally do fix the slider! Mobile adjustments to the slider would be nice too


[10-Jul-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	4t shipping to giedi for 5k cis on LM if anyone can ship that for me?


[10-Jul-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	oops.. that should have gone on Gibson chat /facepalm


[14-Jul-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am not interested in the new process of governing so I will not be running for governor again. AriesNation has said that he will continue the concept of minimal taxes if he is elected, so hold him to it.


[14-Jul-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	o7


[15-Jul-24 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Thanks for keeping Giedi running so well BlueHeeler!


[15-Jul-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks VerdeV


[15-Jul-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	:(


[15-Jul-24 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Wait nooo you don't want to run at all?... That sucks :( I was hoping to at least earn it and get you a seat on the board!!


[15-Jul-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Everything will stay the same though as far as taxes and fees go so no need to worry and hope you change your mind!


[15-Jul-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am an anarchist at heart. I do not like the process that is happening with the government.


[16-Jul-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	üòÖ it makes it hard for smaller planets to maintain with a bunch of extra steps but really good for larger planets


[16-Jul-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	After thinking about it, I think hippy would be more acurate than anarchist.


[16-Jul-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	maybe @BlueHeeler will go find a tiny planet in the forgotten parts of the universe, and settle there and become governor there


[16-Jul-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Ha ha. No government. Funny you say that. I have been looking at OT-627a. Sell all my stuff here and move there to make fuel where there is no government. And employ nothing but pioneers.


[16-Jul-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	simpler times, when all you needed was some food and water, and not any of this fancy "hazmat work suit" nonsense


[16-Jul-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	Well I'll be sorry to see you go BlueHeeler, and good luck out there (You'll need it, now that you've told the assassins where you're going).


[16-Jul-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have not decided to leave yet. I just finished making some ships and I always feel worn out after that.


[16-Jul-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	So, I am actually pulling back a bit and simplifying my current holdings. I won't be able to leave Giedi Prime any time soon for the metal.


[16-Jul-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	from the other direction. I'm winding down Nemesis and my other bases out there. Tired of the long trips.


[17-Jul-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh wait a minute! You can't leave, we just build the shipyard!! lol I've only got a couple uses out of it so far lol


[17-Jul-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Gravy** left.*


[17-Jul-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I'm developing on Yannick. It has a ship yard. Moving stuff from Asbestos to Yannick as it develops. Otheres are more than welcome you join Deckss and I.


[17-Jul-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	*others


[17-Jul-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I should havr thought of this before making the ship yard on Giedi Prime. But it was your idea afterall. It turns out that Deckss and some others had also thought about developing Yannick. It is closer than Asbestos and a bit cheaper to build and maintain. GoGC is currently going with Manufacturing. Deckss is the governor.


[17-Jul-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have stripped my base here down to mining and smelting. I have some welding that I will probably take down later it is simply doing make work.


[17-Jul-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	I always foundYAnnick was a wierd place to have the shipyard in Benten system


[17-Jul-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Yes, I used to as well but now that I am making ships it is more convenient there. Plus there was already things already built and then abandoned years ago.


[17-Jul-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Plus, I don't have to develop the planet on my own. Deckss WANTS to be governor.


[17-Jul-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am shuuting down my operations out Nemesis way. Tired of the trip time. But will keep Etherwind, Giedi Prime and Proxion to help support operation in Benton System.


[17-Jul-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Yannick shipyard is currently upgrading one of my ships and I almost have the parts for another ship to sell.


[17-Jul-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	benton system best system


[17-Jul-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	yes!


[17-Jul-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	If I could just finish the never ending repairs.


[17-Jul-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	I buildmy benten system ship there.. <sighs... the memories>


[17-Jul-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	oh it's manufacturing now. :O


[17-Jul-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Yes. Seems the best compromise for building ships.


[17-Jul-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have two BR1s for sale in the LM.


[17-Jul-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	I might look at Yannick.. though my permits require ridiculous amounts of AFABS


[17-Jul-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I'm at level 22 and I cannot push myself to upgrade again - even though I make AFABS.


[17-Jul-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am evaluating the worth of some of my outlying bases and collapsing some in order to get permits.


[17-Jul-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	just behind you on 21


[17-Jul-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll be on Yannick soon as well but it's a low priority. Originally it was suppose to go fuel CoGC so I had setup and prepared NAB to import. Since they decided to go with Manu I'm not in to big of a hurry xD


[17-Jul-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll be moving my APF and UPF's there probably in a couple weeks :) Along with a bunhc of 3d printers. I'm just waiting around for more workers bc I can't afford for APF/UPF to lose efficiency lol


[17-Jul-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	*Not moving away from Giedi, just Yannick will be my new Manu base since I don't have one of those yet. My Manu stuff is scattered across various planets


[17-Jul-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	btw Katoa currently says "Available plots:  1 / 387"   (on the subject of manufacturing bases)


[17-Jul-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but i can't tell if the game is lying to me or not


[26-Jul-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	Yeess, echidnas! We need a level 3 wildlife park to have the echidnas in it.


[26-Jul-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	If we get some of those spikey rascals my workers will probably be fully satisfied without even having coffee.


[26-Jul-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Love me some echidnas xDD I think? lol


[26-Jul-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Hedgehog?


[01-Aug-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I may end up running an Eng program just for security. We're only at a 6% unemployment and I'm not sure who all has Eng here besides me


[01-Aug-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I do sometimes, but I wouldn't think it worth the money to keep a large amount of surplus engineers around. If there is a need later, running a program is easy enough and happiness seems to be ticking up for the Engineers, once it is higher the migration will stop.


[01-Aug-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Gotcha, that makes sense.


[01-Aug-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll hold out and see what the next POPR does


[01-Aug-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Everything will be upgraded here soon anyways so we should see happiness go up slightly. Mainly doing it so I'm only providing OFF, SOI, and maybe DW and a few others as needed


[01-Aug-24 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	This will allow 70+ percent on no unemployment with less materials :)


[02-Aug-24 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Nikkip**:	ENG? Bah! It's the ECH population that is of grave concern here.


[14-Aug-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	You'll see a motion pass related to taxes here in a few hours. Don't fret! This is lowering the LM ad taxes to absolute minimum. I noticed yesterday these were not already set at minimum and the LM is rarely used so win win


[14-Aug-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this will be a good test of the new motion system, to see if it's clear to everyone what's changing (since it was impossible to know in the old system)


[14-Aug-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I've seen notification for other planets on certain things but not others. We passed a motion last week to adjust infrastructure levels (I upgraded everything) and I don't remember getting a notification for it


[14-Aug-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	hrm, the motion (as it appears to me) just says:  "Set local market fees to 25 and time factor to 2."


[14-Aug-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but i kind of which it also told me the current market fees and time factor


[14-Aug-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	that said, this is still way better than the old system


[14-Aug-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The mods must have changed it. I am fairly certain that I put everything as low as I could. Thanks Ariesnation for fixing it.


[14-Aug-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	The update broke a few things. That may have been one of them?


[14-Aug-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	woohoo :)


[14-Aug-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	You can keep that bright crap. I walk outside and instantly melt


[18-Aug-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	POPR looks really good after those upgrades! At the current rate of only supply OFF, SOI, and UTS (and pending lv 3 on PAR) everything is calculates to be above 70% happiness on no unemployment :) This means happiness will always be below 70% unless we actually need workers in which case happiness will bump and start providing workers to even out :)


[18-Aug-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I've got mats inbound to take care of CoGC before the new week so don't worry there! :) I'll happily continue supplying both upkeep and CoGC, nobody has to worry about a thing lol


[18-Aug-24 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**AriesNation**:	@Nikkip ya that is intended sorry xD I'm waiting for a clean POPR. All should be good without it anyways


[22-Aug-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-24 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	Ah, I see. You can use the clean POPR as bedding for the new animals to save resources, which was part of your plan.


[23-Aug-24 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Good names! Mine are all 2k/2k right now but may convert one for long distances. Line Feed, Carriage Return, Escape, Tabulate and End Of Line.

[23-Aug-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Gas Guzzler is my 1k/3k ship. Periodically I'm tempted to rename Big Ben as it was my first to upgrade to 1k/1k so seemed big at the time.


[23-Aug-24 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Aug-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	where there 22 ships that came before it?  no, but don't tell that to Ship23-Heavy.   it thinks it comes from a long and honorable line of heavy haulers and it runs best when kept in a good mood


[23-Aug-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Sep-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	New POPR came out confirming the need for the next level of infrastructure so I'll throw that HAB in in a couple days. I keep forgetting to bring the fabs to finish that last one üòÖ someone is building more eng but it's alright. Programs are keeping up so we're still good!

**AriesNation**:	Yes, why?


[04-Sep-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	It's that way on purpose for minimum taxes and fees. There are no plans to change this any time soon.


[04-Sep-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Please let me know what you need.


[04-Sep-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We're set at the moment honestly. POPR looks good, I've got supplies sitting around for various POPI and CoGC. I'll throw that HAB in the PAR tomorrow. Someone else needed one so I made a shiny new one for here


[04-Sep-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	There's nothing else really to do but sit back and relax :)


[04-Sep-24 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Okay, thanks. If you need anything tell me.


[04-Sep-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	Oh I was just wondering, I heard most planets are like that.


[04-Sep-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nikkip**:	Us peasants are a charity case.


[05-Sep-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Will do thank you @BlueHeeler! I think most planets goals are to either break even or even make at least a little bit back. On Giedi the taxes have just been structured with more importance over minimum and no fees and I'm fine footing the bill. At least til we get huge then might have to think of something else. Though that is way off


[05-Sep-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	HAB has been added to the PAR :) Level should automatically increase in a few days on the next POPR


[05-Sep-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Do you need more HAB?


[05-Sep-24 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Nope, just needed the 1. I had it in my inventory for like 2 weeks but someone else needed it. So I sold it and made another :)


[05-Sep-24 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	who is this wizard who can produce HABs out of thin air


[05-Sep-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Sep-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**AriesNation**:	It pains and saddens me to say this but...


[27-Sep-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I am retiring from governing. Over the next month or so I will be stepping away from all governing related tasks. Our Lord and Savior, BlueHeeler, is willing to take back up this mantle as he has done for years and I greatly appreciate letting me have the opportunity to call Giedi Prime my home!


[27-Sep-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I will still be around, I'm not going anywhere. Just the parliament update is not the direction I wanted governing to go for my own personal reasons. Governing has always been my favorite part of the game (and upkeep, CoGC, looking at the spreadsheets, etc) but the parliament update I feel has ruined it for me. The update itself is amazing! It brings together people who normally would never know the other exists. It promotes team work and diversity. It's great! Just not my cup o' tea. I apologize and hope I haven't offended anyone for only being Giedi's governor for a short time!


[27-Sep-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	With that I have withdrawn my running for governor. I will continue to govern Brokkraf for a short time until someone is willing to step in and I am also only staying as a member of parliament on Phobos for one more term.


[27-Sep-24 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	BlueHeeler, thank you so much for an amazing task and I enjoyed throwing upgrades to make everything cheaper/easier to maintain! You will still always have my vote :)


[27-Sep-24 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no apologies needed, governor


[27-Sep-24 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Thank you sir! It was tough coming to this decision. I'm just not feeling it any more. There's way to many extra steps to governing now and having to coordinate with multiple people... It's a pain xD I'm one of those weird loan wolf peoples


[27-Sep-24 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this game is supposed to be fun, so please don't feel like you have to stick to something that is no longer fun


[27-Sep-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I know, it just sucks because the backend of governing I still enjoy to do! I may even start working with consulting current governors and helping to upgrade infrastructure to make a profit or even cut taxes!


[27-Sep-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I announced to Brokkraf my retirement as well where I've been a governor for over a year since RNGZero stepped away. I'm avoiding that channel at the moment. That one hurts


[27-Sep-24 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	speaking as a small-time governor myself, i can for sure say that having a long-time pro to talk to would be very useful


[27-Sep-24 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh I see you took over CB! Big shoes to fill xD jkjk


[27-Sep-24 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If you ever need anything or just some advice, lemme know! I know Rasd took pretty well care of it so you should be set and forget for awhile


[27-Sep-24 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	haha, you're quite right, Rasd was a fixture of CB for a very long time


[27-Sep-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Probably still bits and pieces of him laying around the collectors! xD


[27-Sep-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Which we will in fact touch, right? xD


[27-Sep-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thank you @AriesNation for the trmendous contribution that you have made to Giedi Prime in the short time that you were Governor. Players may recognize what you have done but I do.


[27-Sep-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am not a fan of the new government process either but I will do what I can to keep Giedi Prime functioning. I am looking for continued votes from those that have voted for me in the past.


[27-Sep-24 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	It would be nice if they had a referendum option, so you could have a popular vote to decide whether to have a single governor or the parliament. Thanks for all the hard work Aries!


[27-Sep-24 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	So that you all know, this government does not generate enough credits to pay for consumables, in order to keep all taxes at a minimum. If you want to contribute please do not provide anything that isn't already being supplied. AriesNation has set it up to function this way. Let me know if there is something that you require, programs for instance.

[28-Sep-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SilentReaper**:	I've only been here a couple weeks. Zero complaints tax wise haha. If they need to be raised to take care of the planet, I'm cool with that. Whatever you guys need to keep that COGC goin.

[24-Oct-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I'd take 200 SIO at that price.


[24-Oct-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

If you feel inclinde to help out and it is appreciated, please don't add upgrade stuff or anything that is not already being maintained - OFF, SOI and UTS for POPI and of course DW, MCG, PE, and RAT.

**eminence32**:	hi all, we're starting to think about what it would take to build some Gateways around the Benten area. the costs to build one are pretty impressive, probably 200 million minimum, probably more like 300mil. the bill of materials for an upgraded gateway looks like this: https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/images/gateway-cost-summary.png

[02-Dec-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if anyone is interested in helping out, either supplying some of these parts, contributing funds to buy these parts, or helping to coordinate all this, please reach out either here or in the UFO discord


[02-Dec-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	160HSE would be pretty do-able given a bit of time.  Some have tricky scale, like 1000PSH, but I make plenty of TI and NFI. Total cost seems market price rather than input costs. HSE only cost 7.5k each to make even if they are selling for a lot more.


[02-Dec-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, i also think that table is based on market prices


[02-Dec-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	SEA is currently a loss maker (for my facilities anyway), so better to buy off the market than try and produce.


[02-Dec-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i have no idea when the gateway update is coming, but i think it's worth starting to prepare now.  some of those materials don't even exist in game yet, so i think it makes sense to start stockpiling now (so later we can focus on the new stuff)


[02-Dec-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Yep, I went mat sst and got an error ;)


[02-Dec-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm going to personally start to stockpile some of the stuff i can make easily (SEA, and the R-fabs), but i don't have some of the more advanced production lines (like PP4s and APFs)


[02-Dec-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if anyone plans on making some of this stuff, please let me know, so i can make a note in my tracking sheet


[02-Dec-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Profit margins are high on the A-fabs, so make sense to donate them rather than the marginal ones. A preferential system works better for me - like any 100 A-fabs would be reasonable for me to donate, just tell me what to shift my production to.


[02-Dec-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the BOM in the above screenshot is for a gateway with a full set of distance upgrades, which we might not need (depending on where the gateway goes)


[02-Dec-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Maybe record an "in kind" offer. I produce about 75% of that list as a diverse operator, so maybe lock in more narrow producers first and then we talk about what I should produce?


[02-Dec-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, good thought.  my messages here (and to other local chats) is just to identify interested and capable parties.  we're not yet at the point where we're handing out production orders


[02-Dec-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so i'm putting you down as someone who's interesting in helping out :)


[02-Dec-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I'll stockpile some A-fabs once my HQ upgrade is complete.

**eminence32**:	üëç


[02-Dec-24 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I find lead in time is more the issue, establishing supply chains etc. I produce a trickle of TRU atm, but if you wanted 4000 I'd need a bit of time to ramp things up.


[02-Dec-24 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, understood


[02-Dec-24 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i even think some people might deploy dedicated bases for some of this stuff


[02-Dec-24 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I did have that thought, that it would be a fun challenge to establish a base purely to mass produce the needs :)


[02-Dec-24 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, that would be fun


[02-Dec-24 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-24 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	i'm off to bed for now, thanks for all your good thoughts (and future production capabilities)


[02-Dec-24 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	Have a good rest! Not being a scrooge, but I'll prob donate as much to Etherwind as I do to Giedi, so I need to make sure expectations don't become insane.


[03-Dec-24 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	100% understood


[03-Dec-24 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i am hoping that over the next week or two, we'll get a better sense about who is able to contribute (big or small)


[03-Dec-24 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	which will help us understand what our overall production capacility looks like, which will then help determine how many gateways we can afford


[03-Dec-24 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Looked at the list.. now to work out what the fudge all the abbreviations are! :')


[03-Dec-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Is that list the potential mats for one gateway?


[03-Dec-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	those are the mats for one gateway with the maximum distance upgrades


[03-Dec-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i've got some spreadsheet work to do to figure out exactly what we need, but at a minimum i think it will be 1 gateway with just 1 distance upgrade

**eminence32**:	ahoy


[27-Jan-25 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	So I am curious, I see a lot of familiar names. What do y'all use your metals for?


[27-Jan-25 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	construction!


[27-Jan-25 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Any particular projects?


[27-Jan-25 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	fabs.  lots of fabs


[27-Jan-25 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for base expansion


[27-Jan-25 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Similar ideas I see. lol


[27-Jan-25 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	AL for PP2 input?


[27-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and FE for PP1 inputs


[27-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	You really commit to it. I guess I just don't get the justification to keep PP1. Is it more profitable some times?


[27-Jan-25 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	about 70 AL per day and 35 FE per day, plus some other misc things from the smelter


[27-Jan-25 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, when i set them up, PP1s made some sense.  i don't have the heart to deconstruct them, though


[27-Jan-25 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I get FE > STL, but idk how much I really need in a week, I was gonna live tweek it as needed to get a good setup going


[27-Jan-25 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, obviously you don't need to commit to anything, but it all uses the same production lines


[27-Jan-25 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you find yourself needed FE, just queue up a few non-recurring orders and in a few days you'll have what you need


[27-Jan-25 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Ah, that reminds. Do people sell loose metal on this planet, or are things sparse?


[27-Jan-25 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	i usualy just let it stock up, then ship to my other base, but if there's an LM ad, i could probably fill on occasion


[27-Jan-25 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i don't generally see sell orders of FE/AL on the LM, but if you needed some, make an offer


[27-Jan-25 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	if you ever just need some extra ore, I can cover that too xD i actually make more than I need, but that's partly from my current focus on steel


[27-Jan-25 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Any for ALO often? I am looking to buy both, but idk what my numbers will look like long term per week until I get up and running


[27-Jan-25 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	When I ran the numbers last, it was less than 200 of each a week


[27-Jan-25 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	as far as I can eyeball, 1 extractor can keep up with either 2 AL smelters, or 3 FE smelters


[27-Jan-25 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	And that was full mass, I am not going that fast rn


[27-Jan-25 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	that sounds about right.  i have 7 extractors and 15 smelters


[27-Jan-25 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	yeah, more of each makes the ratio more specific, i'm running 4/7 but that was optimal for AL and a little bit of FE


[27-Jan-25 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i tend to take the lazy approach to ratios and balancing, which is to make an excess of everything, and then just sell the stockpile when it gets too big :)


[27-Jan-25 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Factorio style, gotcha xD


[27-Jan-25 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	exactly!


[27-Jan-25 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it's also why my friends hate playing factorio with me ;)


[27-Jan-25 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	if the belts are always full, then your factories always have supply


[27-Jan-25 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	but yeah, if you need some ore to jumpstart, or fill in the gaps before you get fully running, toss up an LM ad and it'll probably get filled before too long


[27-Jan-25 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Going rate is lowest ask? idk whats normal here


[27-Jan-25 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	I'll sell them to you for whatever since I just dump them onto the CX for whatever's there


[27-Jan-25 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Highest bid then? I'm just asking for what's fair rate, I will pay it


[27-Jan-25 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	FEO, 50... ALO, idk, 75? XD


[27-Jan-25 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	but that's me


[27-Jan-25 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	a good default or starting place would be half-way between the lowest ask and the highest bid


[27-Jan-25 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Good to know, thank


[27-Jan-25 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	since you'd be saving money compared to buying from the CX, and the other party would get more money compared to selling on the CX


[27-Jan-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	^ that's always a good one for LM ads too


[27-Jan-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	and no shipping costs for either


[27-Jan-25 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	That's profitable for both sides?? Like actually?


[27-Jan-25 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, assuming that both parties would otherwise try to instantly trade on the CX (which of course isn't always the case)


[27-Jan-25 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	it's instant, so better than selling down to current ask, and no shipping costs, so yeah


[27-Jan-25 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	current bid*


[27-Jan-25 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	to be fair, some people value the 'no shipping to deal with' more than the difference in profit anyway


[27-Jan-25 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Nice. I appreciate that. I will set some up in a sec, I am having to double back and grab the rest of the base from cx.

[28-Jan-25 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Would the planet be able to support ~300AL/w? Like Do yall make that much extra, or is that too much?


[28-Jan-25 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Looking at 6EXT 11SME with 2STO to allow plenty of overflow and time for low maintaince


[28-Jan-25 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	That's the most ALO I would need in a week, prob less


[28-Jan-25 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Not AL, ALO my bad


[28-Jan-25 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	my guess is that no one produces a lot of extra ore.  i guess that almost everyone immediately smelts it on site


[28-Jan-25 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Gotcha, thats what i was wondering earlier, whether people had loose ore or if it was tightly scrounged on


[28-Jan-25 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	(that said, a few thousand units of ore traded on the CX, so obviously that ore comes from somewhere)


[28-Jan-25 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I'll be posting LM ads later, I just am getting the last of my stuff over, and we are going to rev up


[28-Jan-25 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	like a day or so


[28-Jan-25 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have 5 EXT, 2 FS, 6 INC, 17 SME and 3 STO.


[28-Jan-25 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I almost always have extra ALO and FEO. I also smelt AUO, TIO and SIO that I bring into the planet.


[28-Jan-25 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The output goes primarily to Yannick but from Katoa I distribute some to my other planets.


[28-Jan-25 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The FS is primarily used to make UTS for the infrastructure here.


[28-Jan-25 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Right now I have 289 ALO and 344 FEO and still extracting both.


[28-Jan-25 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	@bluehealer I am looking to add another ASM soon. Is there anything I can contribute to get the staff?


[28-Jan-25 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	No need to contribute. According to the current population report there are 28 ENG waiting for jobs. I can run another Immigration program for TEC and that should help you.


[28-Jan-25 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	Technicians 50 (31) Engineers 20 (1) Are the bracketed numbers the currently available?


[28-Jan-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	that is on my construction page?


[28-Jan-25 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	there are 28 jobs waiting for engineers (not 28 engineers waiting for jobs)


[28-Jan-25 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	ah ok


[28-Jan-25 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	I have extra ALO, as I wait for experts. Once I have the proper amount I will make less than 1 ALO extra a day.


[28-Jan-25 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**legosteve**:	6 EXT 12 SME, 2 metalurgy, 4 resource extraction experts. All for AL production.


[28-Jan-25 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Anyone need anything shipped from Benten Station to here? I still have about 440 M^3 available


[28-Jan-25 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ASimpleToaster**:	@Joanna_Hart I have a small shipment


[28-Jan-25 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	send a contract then, since I need to send the ship anyway, half standard rate is fine


[28-Jan-25 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ASimpleToaster**:	What even is the standard rate these days? lol


[28-Jan-25 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	i think standard rate for shipping is 10 currency per ton/m^3


[28-Jan-25 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	at least that's what I'd consider standard xD sometimes you see higher or lower


[28-Jan-25 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	Expected delivery time is approximately 19 hours


[28-Jan-25 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Weird idea. If I went full EXT to generate as much ALO as I can, would anyone be willing to trade ALO for AL? Like I fill someone's inputs in exchange for outputs, or a certain ratio of them?


[28-Jan-25 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Idk what those ratios would be rn, but just an idea. I could run 14EXT with 2STO. 300ALO+ a day, maybe 6ALO for 1 or 2 of AL, I might be able to fund O needs depending on how much, maybe C depending on how much,


[28-Jan-25 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Would allow someone to drop their EXT for more focused SME


[28-Jan-25 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	that..... could be viable, but I feel like it'd be best setup with the intent to always do it that way, or part of a corp project?


[28-Jan-25 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I would like to setup that way permanently. It will allow steady ALO development instead of having people having to diversify their single 500 base. I am actually looking at what a full 1000a base look like


[28-Jan-25 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	30EXT, 3STO to allow some overflow


[28-Jan-25 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Hmm. Would only be able to hold 7d worth of build up assuming no one actively trade. Hrm


[28-Jan-25 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	yeah, it'd need some pretty on-time coordination I feel, and 30 EXT would feed a LOT of SME


[28-Jan-25 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	probably more than one person


[28-Jan-25 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Would be a bit over 2 full SME bases. I am considering putting in the UFO channel a deal for it. Would get it a lot of attention. But I would need to restructure a bit


[28-Jan-25 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Sorry about my mistake with the ENG numbers, was rushing out for an appointment. Thanks for setting it straight atlantisrising.


[28-Jan-25 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	uuuh, what did I do?


[28-Jan-25 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I didn't step into the Eng conversation, I started talking about rearranging my base to make as much ALO for the local area as possible


[28-Jan-25 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Speaking of, posted on the UFO deals channel. Am serious about trading ALO for AL


[28-Jan-25 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	If people want to negotaite a diffent ratio I am down to consider, but we both would have to come to an agreement


[28-Jan-25 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	LOL, you're right it was eminence - thank you eminence.


[28-Jan-25 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	o7, nothing if not honest


[28-Jan-25 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	o7


[28-Jan-25 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Eminence, what's your thoughts on my base idea? What do you think is good trade for Mineral to metal? Is 2AL too much for providing the 6 ALO? Or would I need to provide other resources to make it worth it, like O?


[28-Jan-25 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	having 1 person manage a full extractor base, and the other manage a full smelter base?   it could work, but probably would be best if you work with a friend who doesn't really care all that much about trying to perfectly splitting costs.  for example, you could say "i'll give you all my ALE for free, in return for half of your AL production for free"


[28-Jan-25 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	also there's a bit of a balancing problem.  a full base of extractors produce 400 ALE per day, but a full base of smelters can only smelt 320 ore per day


[28-Jan-25 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	And that depends on if the person even wants a full base of SME, or if they want to diversify and use the metals for other things, FS. That's why i want to do it based off ratios of input:output


[28-Jan-25 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	So if someone only needs 600ALO a week, i don't have to worry about what to pencil them in for as a percentage of my output. If i have it, i can just say sure, your price is 200AL. makes things easier


[28-Jan-25 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	FWI: I have a ship on the way with the parts to upgrade the Safety Station and the Infirmary. In a coupple of days I will upgrade the Art Gallery. It will take a while to make all the HAB to upgrade the Wildlife Park but it is planned as well.


[28-Jan-25 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Should be: FYI not FWI. and couple on has 1 p. My keystroke role over is a bit fast.


[28-Jan-25 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	atlantisrising - I think your idea is too complicated. Just fill the base with the right ratio of EXT and SME.


[28-Jan-25 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Maybe im over explaining it, not making it easy to understand?


[28-Jan-25 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I'm trying to _avoid_ mixing the two, instead i focus on Resource Extraction, and 4-7 people focus on Metallurgy by buying from me


[28-Jan-25 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Sounds like you are trying to avoid having to source FLX, C and O.


[28-Jan-25 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I can pretty easily fund O, and some C, but you are right on FLX. wouldn't mind finding someone to get a regular FLX deal though..


[28-Jan-25 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I must admit that I want to get my CHP back on Giedi Prime. Currently I have other bases making it but it interferes with making CL and NS on those bases.


[28-Jan-25 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Just accpt that you smelt without FLX. I do that when I can't get FLX.


[28-Jan-25 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	If you do, you'd have regular buyer of FLX here, and I'm sure I'm not the only one


[28-Jan-25 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am look into what I need to give up. We will see...


[28-Jan-25 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	*looking


[28-Jan-25 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Give up an EXT, I got 'chu ü§£


[28-Jan-25 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you probably only need 1 CHP to support a 500 area base on giedi


[28-Jan-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Is that full time making FLX, or eith making othet things?


[28-Jan-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	When I put it there it will only be making FLX


[28-Jan-25 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Eminence - fair price thanks.


[28-Jan-25 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	mostly full time.  my base here is 750 area and uses 34 FLX per day.  my CHP on umbra (with full chem bonuses) produce 30 units in 23 hours, so just by eyeball, 1 CHP working mostly fulltime will support a 500 area base here


[28-Jan-25 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have 17 SME.


[28-Jan-25 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	BlueHeeler -- sure thing.  if i come across any more HABs, i'll send them your direction


[28-Jan-25 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	But I will sell my excess.


[28-Jan-25 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks - they take so damn long to make. The last WOR is just finishing.


[28-Jan-25 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	atlantisrising -- FLX is not the most profitable thing to produce, but the current CX price of 129 seems pretty fair to me.  i don't think i would ever sell FLX for less than 100


[28-Jan-25 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	BlueHeeler -- if you have input mats for HABs, you can send some to me.  my two UPF lines are currently idle


[28-Jan-25 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have to make the fabs as well. I have a bunch on its way here to upgrade the SS and I.


[28-Jan-25 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	So even though the HABs take a long time, it is time for me to make the FABs.


[28-Jan-25 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	aye


[28-Jan-25 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i am realizing that i burn through *so many* BSE


[28-Jan-25 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Yes, I have to buy a lot of BSE.


[28-Jan-25 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	a huge percentage of my giedi output goes directly into BSEs


[28-Jan-25 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	No doubt. Almost everything from here goes to Yannick to feed my PPXs.


[28-Jan-25 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have a base on UV-796A making TI and a base on JS-601C making FE as well (though it is making some MHL with it).


[28-Jan-25 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	needs TSH *and* HSE?   that's dedication


[28-Jan-25 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	2COL &3INC on Etherwind would cover everything but FLX on a 500a base


[28-Jan-25 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Brokkfraf (JS-601C) is one hop in my milk run from Nemesis to Katoa.


[28-Jan-25 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I make both TSH and HSE on Yannick.

**BlueHeeler**:	Ah, with the CHP I can make SOI for the Wildlife Park consumable - in addition to FLX.


[28-Jan-25 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Okay, so I demolish EXT and STO. Then add HB2, CHP and INC. Waiting for a ship to arrive from Asbestos the will head to Giedi Prime.


[29-Jan-25 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	If you need extra ore to make up that EXT, let me know, we can work something out


[29-Jan-25 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joanna_Hart**:	I'm sending a ship off to Benten Station on a bit of a hard burn, anyone have any deliveries they want outbound?


[29-Jan-25 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	The profit margin on FLX is so low compared to NS/CL it doesn't make sense trying to gear up to do it in a big way.


[29-Jan-25 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, i figure if you produce FLX, you're only producing what you need yourself


[29-Jan-25 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks atlantisrising but I was over producing ore anyway - which is why I decided to do this.


[29-Jan-25 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I won't be gearing up - one CHP to produxe FLX for local use, primarily mine.


[29-Jan-25 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Like I said earlier, I will make SOI for the Wildlife Park as well.


[29-Jan-25 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	everyone loves a nice Zoo


[29-Jan-25 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Yes, especially when all the animals only eat dirt.


[29-Jan-25 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Understood. I like the idea, and want to implement it, but it requires multiple people to work effectively


[29-Jan-25 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have a ship on the way that will upgrade the Art Gallery, make a CHP and another INC.


[31-Jan-25 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	A note to all would be members of parliament: if you are not going to actively participate (vote for motions) thenb don't enter the election. That way I can pass motions immediately instead of having to wait until they time out.

***TAfirehawk** joined.*


[08-Feb-25 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Heads up, I am in the process of filling out a new base that will need TEC and ENG


[08-Feb-25 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	There is currently a Festivities program running that I queued before the requirement came for TEC and ENG. An ENG immigration program is upcoming and it will be followed by a TEC. After that I will continue to run which ever program is most needed. Thanks for the heads, but I have to tell you, you are copmpeting with a few others for workers.


[08-Feb-25 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	If you look at the immigration program history you will notices a long history of Engineer immigration programs.


[08-Feb-25 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	All good, just letting you know :)


[09-Feb-25 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Also, Festival 3 is cheaper and faster to get the TEC fixed


[09-Feb-25 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Okay, I will try running another festival 3 and see if that helps. The cost of the immigration program is a non issue though.


[09-Feb-25 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Fest 3 should be fine. Looking at this weeks POPR it's already pushing techs up 200+. Might be something blocking Engs but I'll take a look at the sheet in a bit


[09-Feb-25 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks


[09-Feb-25 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	We have a few new base that are filling out with TEC and ENG


[09-Feb-25 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Looks like you don't need to be putting DW in the SST. It makes no difference


[09-Feb-25 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Just OFF


[09-Feb-25 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	The sheet shows no deficit, wonder why Eng aren't coming in faster


[09-Feb-25 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I don't. Someone else did that. I will send a DM and ask them not to.


[09-Feb-25 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	It doesn't hurt anything in this circumstance, just a waste of money


[09-Feb-25 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Huge new requirements.


[09-Feb-25 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I know. You have taught me that.


[09-Feb-25 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I haven't looked at this sheet in awhile so maybe I'm missing something @TAFirehaw


[09-Feb-25 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I would think Eng would be coming in at a faster rate. Sheet all looks good


[09-Feb-25 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Maybe it's tied up in getting Tech's in as a pre-req atm. Tec should be good next unless immediate builds are being done


[09-Feb-25 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll take another look in a bit. I'm extremely hungover atm... lol


[09-Feb-25 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Once again I need to remind new people. Do not contribute any consumables other than OFF, SOI, UTS for the POPI and of course DW, RAT, PE and MCG for the CoGC. We have a formula that works.


[09-Feb-25 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Your contributions are appreciated, though unnecessary, but don't wast your time and money providing anything other that what I have indcated.


[09-Feb-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	It takes time to build up the workforce, be patient.


[09-Feb-25 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The planet does not have these workers already they need to immigrate to Giedi Prime. Look at the population report - it comes out weekly, not daily.


[13-Feb-25 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Alr, I've finally got my EXTs going after I've been off the internet for about a week. I'm currently making 700+ALO a day, will be posting a lot to the LM. For anyone looking to buy direct, let me know and we can work out a deal of some kind


[14-Feb-25 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I'm fine with your price on the LM so I will buy when I need it. I need FEO right now, do you have any?


[14-Feb-25 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I don't need 700 per day of ALO, though. That's impressive BTW.


[14-Feb-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks for the ALO atlantisrising.


[14-Feb-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I can do FEO as well for sore sure! But I would like to trade in metals if possible.


[14-Feb-25 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I don't have the mental to math out a fair number, but the bigger the number the better. Trying to set up trades with people to benefit both sides


[14-Feb-25 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I have an ad on UFO, kinda a work in progress


[14-Feb-25 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	As for LM pricing, I will be feeling that out. Do you feel 150 is fair? low? high? I'm trying to find a decent premium for worth buying if you pay cash.


[14-Feb-25 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	My policy is bid price at Benton CX or less. Less for FEO (so heavy) if picked up at Giedi Prime. Your price meets my policy. That said, I have sold FEO on Giedi Prime for 50 previously. Market may be a bit high right now. Best price what people will pay. If it isn't selling then you are asking too much.


[14-Feb-25 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	The market on Giedi Prime has always been slow, but now with so many more bases it might get better.


[14-Feb-25 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I thought I was over producing ore and cut back my extractors. Now I am not getting enough ore so I will need to cut back on smelters a bit. So I will not always need to buy from you, though I am short today.


[14-Feb-25 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I plan to have a longstanding base here. If you want to keep those high SME, I will have 30EXT for at least 6 months, probably longer


[14-Feb-25 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I'll think about it. I have 17 SME and 7 INC. I can easily do with one or two of either of those.


[14-Feb-25 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Right now I am having to deal with a huge repair cycle in addition to pushing AFABs into a HQ upgrade.


[14-Feb-25 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have been very busy with other stuff at home so some of my bases have been neglected.


[14-Feb-25 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Did a little math. 4FEO+1O > 2FE // 8FEO+25O > 3STL


[14-Feb-25 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Let me know if you think these numbers a re good or not


[16-Feb-25 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oops forgot to look at the POPR last week. This week looks good though. I was kinda curious how just a fest 3 would have done though. Techs are only short 10 workers today. Eng the % looks good. Still no deficits so it's just a waiting game it seems


[16-Feb-25 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Safety is really close to being deficit though. Max needs are 14950 and the required needs is sitting right under at 14083.1


[16-Feb-25 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Not a big deal though since there's a ton of unemployed workers


[16-Feb-25 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Festival 3 fixes TEC but the ENG without UNI or LIB will take over a month to fix


[16-Feb-25 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Assuming no more new bases....it is always rough on any planet during a growth phase


[16-Feb-25 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	WAL production is going to be very slow for HCB


[16-Feb-25 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Although adding 3 UNI and putting HD in them isn't as good as ENG immigration


[16-Feb-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks for suggestions. I will do another ENG immigration.


[16-Feb-25 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I can't do any upgrades right now. I am stetched thin with repairs.


[16-Feb-25 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll throw that last LU in a couple days in the UNI for lv 2.


[16-Feb-25 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll grab it next trip to Giedi


[16-Feb-25 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I guess it'd take just as long to just make one here hmm Either way I'll grab it in a couple days


[16-Feb-25 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Huh... we don't have anything started with UNI, yet.


[16-Feb-25 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh I'm an idiot. I must've been looking at the wrong planet


[16-Feb-25 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll take care of lv 1 though. Everything but the LU will be on the next ship but I'll add a couple LU to the queue


[16-Feb-25 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Except HD. I don't make that


[16-Feb-25 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	My spreadsheet says Lv1 Uni is enough to attract workers? @TAFirehawk


[16-Feb-25 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I don't make it anymore either.


[16-Feb-25 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I'll be making it soon. Though not sure of the numbers and I'd rather stay away from providing upkeep stuff. I don't do good with schedules


[16-Feb-25 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	But either way. Lv 1 Uni maybe by next POPR and we'll see what it does


[16-Feb-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If I can make it by next sunday will depend how quick I ship DA to Giedi


[16-Feb-25 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Oh I didn't have everything loaded on the spreadsheet. Looks like lv 1 should bring in 23 workers/week. Lv 3 ~35/week.


[16-Feb-25 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Nutnic wants something to throw his credits at. Okay, Nutnic start making HD or grab what you can from the CX because it looks like we are going to have a UNI.


[16-Feb-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I will see if I can put the process back on Katoa to make HD for the long term.


[16-Feb-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	It's just 1 HD/day


[16-Feb-25 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i just queued up 15 HD and will bring them in to giedi on one of my next trips here


[16-Feb-25 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thanks @eminence


[16-Feb-25 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Nice :)


[16-Feb-25 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I have a stockpile somewhere but I can't find it xD I must've moved it all to Ant


[16-Feb-25 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	lol i didn't realize IDC could be used for UNI upkeep


[16-Feb-25 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	To me that feels like such a waste of spacebucks though lol


[16-Feb-25 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	apparently it's not the worst, though, in terms of cost-per-satisfaction


[16-Feb-25 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I make a lot of GL. Would TUB be an okay substitute for HD?


[16-Feb-25 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i think TUB woud be great


[16-Feb-25 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you need more of it, but it's also much cheaper to produce (and also you probably produce it right here on giedi)


[16-Feb-25 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I produce it on Etherwind and Giedi Prime is on the way back to Katoa - plus I make glass on Katoa as well.


[16-Feb-25 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I make the OFF at Etherwind as well.


[16-Feb-25 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	If we go with TUB then I don't need to build another process.


[16-Feb-25 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Ya I haven't looked at any of the inputs yet. Was just basing off what TA said


[16-Feb-25 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Okay, let me know and I will start making TUB.


[16-Feb-25 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	With providing nothing it only goes down a couple workers total. So Lv 1 Uni with no inputs = 22.5 works.


[16-Feb-25 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	TUB, HD, COF it goes up to 24.5 workers. REA doesn't provide a benefit past nothing


[16-Feb-25 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Neither does BID


[16-Feb-25 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	my understanding is that fully supplying each of the upkeep materials provides an equal mount of satisfaction.  so the thing to do is compare the price of producing 1 HD per day, or 33 TUB per day and just go with whatever is cheapest


[16-Feb-25 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Looking basic CX prices: HD daily price is $3790/day TUB being $8333


[16-Feb-25 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I would actually vote on providing nothing at only a lv 1.


[16-Feb-25 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	At Lv 3 it goes 33.9 (with nothing) to 36.6 with one of the singles above. My spreadsheets not loading all the way so these numbers could be off but still


[16-Feb-25 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for me and my production chains, providing TUB would be 2740 per day, and providing HD would be 3445 per day


[16-Feb-25 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Let's go with lv1 and then see if we need TUB, between eminence and I we can provide TUB.


[16-Feb-25 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I will start bringing AFABs, you don't need to do it all AriesNation.


[16-Feb-25 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	If it's only a 2 worker difference I don't really see the point in providing


[16-Feb-25 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	To late I already got it all on a ship xD


[16-Feb-25 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I make AFABs but I no longer make the other stuff.


[16-Feb-25 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Okay, I am not making TUB.


[16-Feb-25 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I make everything on that list but afabs though lol


[16-Feb-25 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	So I wouldn't say no bc I can just drop them off here for repairs next cycle anyways


[16-Feb-25 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Well, as I said earlier I am struggling with repairs right now. I have had to put my HQ upgrade on hold.


[16-Feb-25 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	It would please me if you provided them and then my AFABs can fund my repairs. I just wanted to pitch in.


[16-Feb-25 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	They're on the way so I'm fine with it xD


[16-Feb-25 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	It's only a couple afabs of each


[16-Feb-25 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	I hope to have ASE going soon to offset some HQ upgrade costs too. But I think I'm only going to make ASE, not the others


[16-Feb-25 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	LU will be done producing ~Friday


[16-Feb-25 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	I am making HD on Katoa. I can bring IDC from Phobos if we need it as well


[16-Feb-25 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	I have 2xLOG on Katoa in 3 days


[16-Feb-25 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	I have 400 TUB on giedi


[16-Feb-25 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I missed a lot here but it isn't that hard running the scenarios in Archiel's Spreadsheet


[16-Feb-25 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Maybe we need a UNI to maintain but it won't help get rid of the negative like running immigration


[16-Feb-25 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Basically we're going for 1 Uni by next POPR. And the debate was between TUB and HD to fulfill as it provides the same amount of workers. So it comes down to whichever is cheaper for the person supplying it


[16-Feb-25 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Doesn't hurt and I wouldn't put any mats into the UNI...simple clicks in the spreadsheet :)


[16-Feb-25 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	HD is cheaper


[16-Feb-25 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Whoever mentioned putting TUB in said they make it cheaper


[16-Feb-25 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	it is why all of KAWA uses it instead of TUB.....got tons of TUB just sitting around doing nothing


[16-Feb-25 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	it is cost/satisfaction, not raw CX cost


[16-Feb-25 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	We're not talking cx costs here. We're talking the person that wants to fulfill that material, which is cheaper for them


[16-Feb-25 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	all in Archiel's Spreadsheet....i love that thing


[16-Feb-25 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Personally I wouldn't put any mats in for the first level. It's only a 2 worker/week difference between no mats and HD/TUB


[16-Feb-25 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	well then sell TUB on CX and buy HD....makes  money in the end


[16-Feb-25 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	oh yeah, definitely don't put mats in UNI until the ENG pop is much larger like I have on other planets


[16-Feb-25 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	i use HD a few places....wouldn't do that here


[16-Feb-25 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	and use HD to support SCI population


[16-Feb-25 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	@TAfirehawk TUB has lower cost per satisfaction *and* is also cheaper for me to make (so probably also cheaper for others to make)


[16-Feb-25 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	awww, damn.   nevermind.  that's only because i had put some price overrides into Archiel's spreadsheet that i forgot about


[16-Feb-25 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	HD is in fact better at CX prices, but still i would argue:  don't look at CX prices if you intend to make the stuff yourself


[16-Feb-25 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	HD is cheaper and you could sell TUB on CX to buy HD on CX and make a profit for a given satisfaction level


[16-Feb-25 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	so yeah, HD is the lowest cost UNI mat....TUB is the next best so it isn't a huge cost difference


[16-Feb-25 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I make a number of Gov Upkeep items but I roughly sell them to the Gov the same price as an individual


[16-Feb-25 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	A planet is just another customer...not a charity case, to me at least :)


[17-Feb-25 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VerdeV**:	I supply OFF to Etherwind at low-to-no profit, but they also have no planetary taxes there.


[17-Feb-25 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have lots of OFF, but thanks for the offer. Feel free to contribute when it is running low.


[22-Feb-25 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Thank you @AriesNation for the upgrade to the UNI.


[22-Feb-25 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	Np, I'll probably end up making but the afabs for the next couple levels as well. I'll have to check the chart to see if it's worth going past lv 1 or if other paths are better


[22-Feb-25 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	*making everything but the afabs

**OptimizedFunction**:	I need 1 single BTA. LM ad is up for 2000 CIS


[24-Feb-25 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	please, somebody <3


[24-Feb-25 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Wish i could, my nearest is BEN and it'd be a 2d wait for me


[24-Feb-25 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	alas, BTAs are not part of my normal repair cycle, so i don't stock any here :(


[24-Feb-25 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	ah shit


[24-Feb-25 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	well, yes i could import from BEN too, i need it here tho (well, technically over in KW-358c but i have a dedicated STL ship running here to pick it up so same thing)


[24-Feb-25 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	Importing from BEN is a pain and wasteful since I have to come here empty mostly


[24-Feb-25 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	;-;


[24-Feb-25 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Solid rip, I'm sorry


[24-Feb-25 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	i do hope someone picks it up by tomorrow


[24-Feb-25 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	This is one of those times when I wish I had a super small super fast ship


[24-Feb-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	zoom zoom


[24-Feb-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	just realised i have a ship idling at BEN


[24-Feb-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	time to put a full WCB to use to bring 1 single BTA to giedi


[24-Feb-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	such efficient use of ships, if Elon saw me he would have a heart attack


[24-Feb-25 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	If you are heading back to BEN with an empty cargobay, i could send a shipping contract to you


[24-Feb-25 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Shame....I have BBH, BDE, BSE sitting here but no BTA

**OptimizedFunction**:	@atlantisrising169 I'll let you know if I do have space going back to BEN :)


[25-Feb-25 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	@atlantisrising169 I have a 2k2k going back to BEN fully empty. I'll have another 2k2k going back to BEN by tomorrow I think


[25-Feb-25 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	departing in a like 4-5 hours


[25-Feb-25 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Sent a Cont @OptimizedFunction


[25-Feb-25 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	ETA ~ 20 hours, really depends on when I wake up and fulfill


[25-Feb-25 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	All good, I'll make sure i have the space for it


[06-Mar-25 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	Hey all! I feel nows as good as time as any to put out a reminder that i sell plenty of ore on demand on the LM. I also am willing exchange in trade, and have an ad on the UFO discord that sort of goes over the idea. Effectively a ratio on the input amounts and output "payouts". Its an idea im trying to get going, or at least see what people think about the idea ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


[06-Mar-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	give me ore!


[06-Mar-25 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OptimizedFunction**:	btw i think your attempt to get an arrangement of payouts is not quite great since most people make bases according to what they need the outputs for. They have output targets. Now if you come in and demand a cut of it as compensation for your ore, it is going to throw those plans out of whack, even if the cut you are asking for is justified and fair


[06-Mar-25 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	That's a very fair point. Hmm. Idk what else I would ask for trade that could be traded consistently.

**erunamo**:	Trading inputs for some of the outputs sounds like a good idea to me.  Seems like the target audience would be a long term partner that plans the base with that in mind :)


[26-Mar-25 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erunamo**:	I am definitely interested so I can drop my extractors but RL is preventing me from reaching out at the moment


[26-Mar-25 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	I actually have a trade going with someone already, and am using the rest of my production, sorry to stop you so quick


[26-Mar-25 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**atlantisrising169**:	If you are interested though, I do a trade of sorts, inputs to outputs. 5ALO:1AL. If this interests anybody (and are willing to pick up from CX) reach out
