**Skahletto**:	There has been a motion set in place to increase the price of warehouse rent again, it is purely to help fund the upgrades of the warehouse. We should be upgrading to level 5 here shortly and will continue to work towards upgrading it. Myself along with many other people on this planet extract LST and need the storage space.


[15-Jul-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Skahletto**:	anyone willing to help contribute to the initiative will get a 100% payback by the OZ-189a government


[15-Jul-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I added level 2 last week, and had planned to add level 3 this week - no reimbursement required.


[15-Jul-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	every other level gains +1 rentable.


[15-Jul-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'm sure we can do this as a community without raising fees.


[15-Jul-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Mats for Level 3 are purchased, will deliver midweek en route to HRT.


[16-Jul-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Anyone with a WCB available in the vicinity, ad up on HRT.

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, voting will close in slightly less than 2 days, and there's a chance I may become the governor. As with the other planets I'm governing, I see my job here as reducing the unemployment rates to a reasonable reserve, so that your production taxes don't go to waste filling POPI inputs unnecessarily.


[24-Jul-24 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Will update more on the plans if I do get the governorship.

[14-Aug-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I'll have a shuttle in system in a couple weeks...


[16-Aug-24 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Please vote me into the parliament at least so I can continue trimming the unneeded PIOs and SETs 🙏

**muad_dib**:	What's the dealio with repairs here? I assume since TSH.IC1 costs so much it skews the best repair timings?


[20-Aug-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	when a planet needs HSE or TSH I tend to repair at 90days (just before to be clear), but yeah, hot planets are very expensive, not a lot of producers of TSH

**--SCHAITR--**:	Welcome!


[21-Aug-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Anyway, I'd like to poll those of you here whether we should pay back the 3 people who contributed to Warehouse level 4. They did so out of their own pocket and have not been compensated.


[21-Aug-24 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We are approaching the time when we have enough money to pay them back, and our only expense now is CoGC upkeep since we're still culling unneeded populations.


[21-Aug-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	So, anyone has strong objections to paying them back for Warehouse L4?


[21-Aug-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my contributions were donations, no recompense was expected.


[21-Aug-24 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(I had pledged levels 2 & 3 unilaterally, though 3 was started before I could drop, so half my load went into level 4...no worries - I was on council at the time, didn't expect we'd be raising taxes to build it, just calling on the community to participate in our planet's growth - others stepped up as well)


[21-Aug-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	If they want repayment, and we have the funds to do it....sure why not.


[21-Aug-24 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you have a record of these contributions? it's been so long, there are no public records of recent contributions...


[21-Aug-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so we're giong to pay now at todays rates for conts from two months ago....curious why this has come up now?


[21-Aug-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and who's providing the records of those contributions....


[21-Aug-24 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We calculated the rate a little while ago so it will be based on the prices at that time. This was something which I had wanted to do but we didn't have the funds for it. We do now


[22-Aug-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	And now that we're only spending on CoGC, we should be seeing a reduction in production fees? Or is there some grand plan to spend the planetary income (feel free to elaborate)?


[22-Aug-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	There should be a reduction in fees, but coming up with the numbers is still a work in progress


[22-Aug-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Mainly because I only have the weekends free to go tinkering with them


[22-Aug-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Should also keep a solid buffer in cash as well while slowly increasing that buffer.


[22-Aug-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Wait taxes are cheap here.... leave them be


[22-Aug-24 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	40 on PIO EXT is 1/3 the max value.

**--SCHAITR--**:	Citizens! As our planetary coffers are doing well even as we continue the culling of the unemployed, we will be reducing taxes. A small present for everyone :)


[30-Aug-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We will keep this level for the next 2 weeks to see how it affects revenue, and will reduce it further if possible.


[01-Sep-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**muad_dib**:	Do taxes cover popi?


[01-Sep-24 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	yes


[01-Sep-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We wouldn’t reduce taxes if they didn’t cover. What we’re trying to aim for is the sweet spot where taxes just cover the POPI, and population is just enough for the players’ needs. Less wastage

[20-Jan-25 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	I'm currently showing a use of 840 pioneers, and I won't be using more than that. I can pull some of the buildings back if that's too much for a start


[20-Jan-25 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	No worries. Just trying to anticipate whether any changes to the pop levels are needed


[21-Jan-25 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-25 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but I also was the one that filled it, so it was likely my boo-boo to begin with....just happen to be on and monitoring nots when it popped.

**Zugore**:	you'll get a bit more visibility if you post them at the other end of the trip (more haulers check HRT LM, whereas here you only get folks that have bases here)
