first on the agenda would be a 15 EXT LST base on nike. All LST would be bought for 50/u which would be daily profit of ~25k. The grant to build the base is 500k. Anyone with permit interested to build it?

[15-Oct-22 02:10 AM] churavis#0000
Domicius expressed interest in possibly building a Nike EXT base


[15-Oct-22 02:16 AM] domicius#0000
I was going to go with 10 EXT and a few PP2s as well


[15-Oct-22 02:16 AM] domicius#0000
Or PP1s


[15-Oct-22 02:16 AM] domicius#0000
To convert LST to the more complex mmon base products so other people can convert their land to the higher up buildings


[15-Oct-22 02:16 AM] balbar#0000
I have 2 permits left right now, so I wouldn't mind putting up another base, especially since I don't have one on Nike. But only if noone else wants to do it üôÇ

üéâ 

[15-Oct-22 02:17 AM] domicius#0000
Anyway, I've scoped it out the plan, have the permit, and I'm about to load up on ANT and fly out


[15-Oct-22 02:17 AM] balbar#0000
building on nike should be easy, with almost all the materials available on site


[15-Oct-22 02:17 AM] domicius#0000
It's all cheap stuff anyway


[15-Oct-22 02:18 AM] balbar#0000

[15-Oct-22 02:18 AM] churavis#0000
DLR has a core module and a bunch of bfabs he can give you


[15-Oct-22 02:18 AM] domicius#0000
OK. I'll post up my ads to you later today


[15-Oct-22 02:19 AM] churavis#0000
I'm give you exact numbers of things in a few hours when his ship arrives


[15-Oct-22 02:20 AM] domicius#0000
Ok


[15-Oct-22 02:21 AM] allocater#0000
keeping it pure LST stacks up the experts and is easier to operate, but we can always use more PP1/2. That would actually be the next base to sponsor since we lost 3 construction bases üòÖ

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[15-Oct-22 02:22 AM] domicius#0000
Depends on the output needed. I thought 400 LST per day would be enough?


[15-Oct-22 02:23 AM] domicius#0000
Threw in 2 STO as well


[15-Oct-22 02:24 AM] churavis#0000
The CX could easily soak up any extra LST and there's always extra shipping capacity leaving Nike

{Reactions}
üëÇ 

[15-Oct-22 02:24 AM] domicius#0000
(actually it's more that basic bfabs are more storage efficient too, so having PP1/2 actually makes it more efficient)


[15-Oct-22 02:25 AM] domicius#0000
It's true, but that's not efficient in terms of Ooga manufacturing. Anyway, if we end up needing more LST I'll strip out the PP1s


[15-Oct-22 02:27 AM] churavis#0000
What do you mean not efficient for OOG manufacturing?


[15-Oct-22 02:31 AM] domicius#0000
What I mean is that surplus LST is just sold. Converting the surplus to Bfabs creates a higher level input that then allows better storage but also saves time for producers to upgrade them in a pp3/4


[15-Oct-22 02:31 AM] domicius#0000
Selling raw materials is not worth a whole lot.


[15-Oct-22 02:35 AM] churavis#0000
DLR has a BMP to convert LST into MCG, which is also in demand


[15-Oct-22 02:36 AM] domicius#0000
Yeah I'm chucking a lot of MCG out on Phobos


[15-Oct-22 02:36 AM] churavis#0000
Thanks to Norwick we've got lots of cheap SIO


[15-Oct-22 02:36 AM] domicius#0000
I'll remember that


[15-Oct-22 02:37 AM] domicius#0000
I can actually bring MCG to Nike if needed there.


[15-Oct-22 02:37 AM] domicius#0000
I have 5 BMPs making MCG non-stop


[15-Oct-22 02:39 AM] churavis#0000
DLR currently has 1.1k SIO on Norwick that he would love to give away


[15-Oct-22 02:41 AM] domicius#0000
Is there a timeline? I can absorb it but it'll take me a minute. I just stocked up on... Everything and I'm short on storage üôÇ


[15-Oct-22 02:42 AM] churavis#0000
It's first come first serve is all


[15-Oct-22 02:43 AM] domicius#0000
Of course


[15-Oct-22 01:16 PM] allocater#0000
ok then we consider LST as solved by Domicius


[15-Oct-22 02:01 PM] exeler#0000
How solved is the LST problem? I was planning on a CHP base for cranking out large amounts of NS on Nike for my next base. 

I can put a few EXT to cover my own LST needs or go full CHP and make better use of the experts.


[15-Oct-22 03:11 PM] domicius#0000
Let me build the base first...

[15-Oct-22 08:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you are in urgent need, you can buy some from me first. I have stocked up a lot before.


[15-Oct-22 08:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
@exeler


[15-Oct-22 08:06 PM] exeler#0000
I don't have a base on Nike yet, but knowing if I should cover my own LST needs or purchase from someone who's otherwise just dumping it into the CX affects my plans a bit.


[15-Oct-22 08:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
Flx only needs a little LST to be satisfied, which is much less than MCG


[15-Oct-22 08:54 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you buy LST only for FLX, I should be able to cover your needs.


[15-Oct-22 09:02 PM] exeler#0000
I was planning on mostly making NS, with a little FLX mixed in to cover my own consumption of it


[15-Oct-22 09:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
I calculated your harmonia hydroponics income, and I don't think it's a good idea to produce C by hydroponics.ü§£


[15-Oct-22 09:06 PM] exeler#0000
It's definitely not the most cost effective way to make C, but it does make WAY more C per area than sourcing crops by FRM. That base is optimized for area/permits instead of cost per C.


[15-Oct-22 09:08 PM] exeler#0000
I'm also going to be making my own NS soon, so the efficiency will get a lot better with that.


[15-Oct-22 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
I prefer to purchas low-profit and high-source products in cx.


[15-Oct-22 09:13 PM] exeler#0000
I started as a C farmer, so I was already in the business. I'm also getting to the point where I'm not just trying to make a huge profit anymore. I don't care too much about making a number get big, so my Harmonia base is also partly just a fun project to do something a little different.

üëç 

[15-Oct-22 09:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
In the long run, I will build hydroponics in Harmonia to produce things like PIB. I'm considering moving my PG base to Umbra or something like that to reduce my C demand.


[15-Oct-22 09:19 PM] exeler#0000
Isn't PIB an ORC product?


[15-Oct-22 09:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
The price of C in Antares is very high, and there is also a lack of low development cost chemical planet except griff. I think we can consider relying on cx raw materials to produce PG, PE and other very light things in other regions and bring them back.


[15-Oct-22 09:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
yes


[15-Oct-22 09:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
Of course, the biggest problem we are facing now is the shipping capacity.


[15-Oct-22 10:42 PM] exeler#0000
That's why I like the HYF+INC option. H20 and NS in, C out. It's actually pretty easy to stock the base up with large quantities of the inputs and just let it go.


[15-Oct-22 11:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I do have some PIB available, Rune and I have most of a VG chain built.


[15-Oct-22 11:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I also have HOP and GRA that I don't intend to personally use


[16-Oct-22 12:02 AM] churavis#0000
I'd like to buy some of that


[16-Oct-22 12:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have 75 HOp and 15 GRA on Demeter. The HOP is 2200/u the GRA is 3300/u I guess. The GRA price works out to the same price per hour of orchard time. Seems kinda high though...


[16-Oct-22 12:10 AM] churavis#0000
Cool, I can't promise I'll buy these on a regular basis but we'll see


[16-Oct-22 12:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
No problem. It sounds like there are a lot of buyers in the corp

We were keeping up with C price, but now it suddenly dropped everywhere except in ANT üòÖ


[23-Oct-22 12:32 AM] allocater#0000
500k grant for someone to produce PSM/PSL on heph. Max demand: 48 PSM + 36 PSL / week, guaranteed payment: 1000/PSM, 2000/PSL, ratio of POL/PPF is up to you.


[23-Oct-22 12:44 AM] churavis#0000
That's 4 or 5 PPF depending on how many experts you stack


[23-Oct-22 01:59 AM] balbar#0000
I have 1 permit remaining for now. if noone else takes the offer I will. Problem from my side is the supply for the POL, but I should be able to get the C,MG and H from the CX


[23-Oct-22 02:20 AM] exeler#0000
I should be able to supply C. I'm currently making a good bit more than I consume myself.


[23-Oct-22 02:30 AM] allocater#0000
yeah the base would mainly be supplied from CX, you can even use a STL ship for that


[23-Oct-22 03:39 AM] balbar#0000
That is a good idea. I'll wait till tomorrow. if you have no takers i'll do the base and order a puddle jumper üôÇ

[24-Oct-22 01:28 AM] allocater#0000
look at nike LM, almost all are corp ads of what is needed


[24-Oct-22 01:52 AM] balbar#0000

TRU on CX is almost same price, 54 LBH I have on Ant and 7 BTA on heph


[27-Oct-22 04:17 AM] allocater#0000
alright, time for the Griffenstone HAL base then. 500k grant to build it and supply HAL on the LM. I am sure we can also integrate supply shipments into existing routes, so no ship has to be assigned to it.

[27-Oct-22 10:25 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I would also be willing to sponsor a plastics base, my last trip out to Griff I stayed 2 days and came back with a lot less PG/EPO than I would have liked. I would imagine Griffonstone would also be the best place for that! Perhaps we could combine these into one? What if we went half and half for a 800K grant? Or is it best to keep them seperated?


[27-Oct-22 10:32 AM] churavis#0000
For stacking experts is better to keep them separated and we could likely consume a full base worth of HAL production

{Reactions}
üëç 

[27-Oct-22 11:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, I would buy tons of HAL.  We could probably do with two extraction bases


[27-Oct-22 02:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, I have saved enough materials to build a base and 5 EXTs in griff. If anyone needs them, I can provide them directly as a sponsorship. ü•≥


[28-Oct-22 02:52 AM] allocater#0000
it's a boring base, but at 100/HAL it would be a stable income of 10k/day (15 EXT)

It's best to build two warehouses, otherwise the warehouses will easily run out of capacity.


[28-Oct-22 03:06 AM] allocater#0000
if all HAL is bought instantly by the consumers there is no need for STO

[28-Oct-22 03:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
According to the internal price, if there are five experts, they can also earn 14,000 AIC a day.


[28-Oct-22 03:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
If there is no warehouse, it will be full in about 4 days. If there are two warehouses, it is 25 days. The output gap is only 14 per day, that is, 1400AIC.

Would anyone be interested in sponsoring an Aluminum mining/processing base on Deimos? Between my bases on Harmonia and Nike I have pretty much everything needed to get PP2s working except for Aluminum.

I would help sponsor an EPO base, I'll put up 250K üôÇ


[13-Nov-22 10:45 AM] churavis#0000
I would help sponsor an EPO base for the same amount as well, but it needs to be someone who has a good source of C, H, O and HAL. I'm not sure corp pricing for EPO can cover buying those from the CX


[13-Nov-22 10:46 AM] allocater#0000
EPO corp price can be whatever EPO producer wants it to be üòÑ


[13-Nov-22 10:47 AM] allocater#0000
H is from YJ14, C is from all the nascent bases, O is from Etherwind, HAL is from sginga.

[13-Nov-22 10:52 AM] churavis#0000
It appears that sginga's base won't be able to produce enough for our current demands, we'd probably need another HAL base if we got a full EPO base


[13-Nov-22 10:54 AM] domicius#0000
I'm up for building a base. Found a planet last night.


[13-Nov-22 11:03 AM] domicius#0000
Hmm, or Zv-759d. HAL and MGS


[13-Nov-22 11:04 AM] churavis#0000
Only if you can get INS and HSE


[13-Nov-22 11:05 AM] domicius#0000
HSE seems to be the problem


[13-Nov-22 11:07 AM] domicius#0000

Let me scope it out.


[13-Nov-22 11:15 AM] churavis#0000
I have some HSE and a little INS but not much as Rfab demand has been high


[13-Nov-22 11:16 AM] churavis#0000
Also, ZV-759d's POPR is tomorrow and it doesn't have a big enough population to have a very big instant worker pool


[13-Nov-22 11:18 AM] domicius#0000
Any other suggestions planet-wise?


[13-Nov-22 11:19 AM] domicius#0000
Not like I'm going to build the base in less than a week anyway, between shipping all the stuff and buying it, whereever we choose.


[13-Nov-22 11:19 AM] domicius#0000

[13-Nov-22 11:34 AM] domicius#0000
Seems important


[13-Nov-22 11:36 AM] domicius#0000
So, 9 EXT, 4 CHP, 4 POL seems to be the way to go.


[13-Nov-22 11:37 AM] domicius#0000
I can do that faster than upgrade Phobos (what with all the Rfabs I'd need)


[13-Nov-22 11:40 AM] domicius#0000
Anyone have 30 HSE?


[13-Nov-22 12:09 PM] jackinabox86#0000

[13-Nov-22 12:10 PM] jackinabox86#0000
There is a HAL planet starting with EW or EB that doesn‚Äôt have as expensive of building mat needs. Was looking at that as an expansion for myself, but with the kids at home, I barely have time to keep bases stocked that I already have


[13-Nov-22 12:59 PM] domicius#0000
Yeah. In do expansions every few months at best!


[13-Nov-22 02:02 PM] exeler#0000
I think it'd be worthwhile having a dedicated CL base. That way POL bases can be set up with more POL to create EPO. 

I'd be interested in sponsoring a base with EXT for HAL and CHP to process it into CL.


[13-Nov-22 02:03 PM] domicius#0000
Well, I need lfabs and stuff....


[13-Nov-22 02:03 PM] domicius#0000
I've got the HSE.


[13-Nov-22 02:11 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Would just having a HAL extraction base on YK-005d make sense? High HAL concentration 3 jumps away and only requires INS rather than HSE and INS then the other Chem planets can be dedicated to chem stuff. It is more shipping though and it's a bit out of the way.


[13-Nov-22 02:12 PM] exeler#0000
Do you already have a base on Griffonstone?

If not, I think one there would be fine. You get the cogc boost to the CHP to make CL, and can sell it on planet so shipping should be pretty easy. Just dump a bunch of consumables there and take the NA away when it starts to pile up. 

PG and EPO are very lightweight, so I think if you just threw up a bunch of LM orders for the NA to take it to the CX, you'd have no problem getting it taken either. I imagine the bottleneck for most griffonstone bases is the shipping of inputs, not the exports so there should be plenty of extra space.

planet I was looing at for HAL was EW-238c.  It's 7 jumps, so no joke, but also only requires SEA

[13-Nov-22 02:30 PM] jackinabox86#0000
only so much area in a base


[13-Nov-22 02:31 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah I already have a 750 base on Griff. 5x PP3s requires about 50% more EPO than my Griff base can output.


[13-Nov-22 02:36 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
You also can't put down CHP on any HAL tap as they require lots of settlers


[13-Nov-22 02:45 PM] domicius#0000
EXT overperforms CHP anyway - so you can put some CHPs and still get extra whatever to give around the Corp. Also, I need some stuff for my food prod.

I have all the mats now (except consumables) so once I build my next HQ expansion (have all the parts) I'll out the base down.


[13-Nov-22 08:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
I am short of EPO, so I can sponsor HSE to those who want to build EPO base, and I can also sponsor cash.üòÖ


[16-Nov-22 03:35 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I've been sweeping through my bases and repairing all my buildings this week and I have one base left but its a tough one - QJ-382g needs like 100+ AEF üò¨ üò¨ üò¨ . So I think the time has come that we secure some NE for AEF production internally!

I am pledging 600K for anyone looking to commit to a long distance base! I will also help out with logistics, lending a 2000 ship to make occasional runs for you üôÇ The most appealing planet (by far) is Nova Honshu near Hortus which also has CLI and SIO if that helps! Let me know if anyone is interested


[16-Nov-22 03:42 PM] churavis#0000
I thought it was PP2 capacity that was at issue?


[16-Nov-22 03:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah NE isn't the main constraint of AEF I don't think


[16-Nov-22 03:44 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I can run my PP2's on AEF if you guys have NE? Looking at the CX it appears @allocater is the only one in all of Antares with stock lol. And it looks like he's just getting it from buy orders so I don't see that as a reliable source going forward


[16-Nov-22 04:02 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The ongoing need for AEF is minor though? Just asking on the planet could get you what you need?


[16-Nov-22 04:02 PM] churavis#0000
It's going to grow with all the gas giant bases planned


[16-Nov-22 04:15 PM] churavis#0000
Hortus CX has plenty of NE, it would be easier to just send a ship out there every once in a while


[16-Nov-22 04:19 PM] churavis#0000
For 748k ICA you could fill an LCB with 2k NE and that would last us a long while


[16-Nov-22 04:23 PM] churavis#0000
That comes out to about 11 full gas giant base construction/repair


[17-Nov-22 12:59 AM] allocater#0000
ha, yeah I am sitting on 500 NE if anyone wants to get started before a NE base is up 200/u


[17-Nov-22 01:00 AM] allocater#0000
also 36 AEF left from N base construction 2k/u


[17-Nov-22 01:01 AM] allocater#0000
also left 500 NE on hortus


[17-Nov-22 10:53 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Sent you a contract for 100. Assuming ANT works? For the AEF, is it on ANT as well?


[17-Nov-22 11:34 AM] allocater#0000
yup

[12-Dec-22 03:27 AM] domicius#0000
I am gearing up to do that anyway - make glass there too.


[12-Dec-22 03:27 AM] domicius#0000
Just need to plan it out.


[12-Dec-22 03:28 AM] domicius#0000
Of course if someone else wants to do it, and get the grant, go for it!


[12-Dec-22 08:20 AM] churavis#0000
I am currently building infrastructure on WU-070A to turn it into a metallurgy planet for glass smelting. Rune has said he has plans to move there as well. After that we should have plenty of basic GF components and it will also allow any current glass smelters on Deimos to move their operations there in order to free up space on Deimos. I may also start smelting SI there as well but we'll see.


[12-Dec-22 09:17 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I have lots on Nike, I can sell you 200 if you need AL? I should have 200 on Deimos by end of day today too - I'll pick up one of your buying ads once I have it

[13-Dec-22 12:05 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Hi all, just cross-posting here - I put a suggestion in #fuel-ops to offer someone new to get into making fuel. I will sponsor a base for 500k, you can put it wherever you see fit but the one ask I do have is that you assist with filling corp orders on Nike and Deimos. 

Fuel prices are almost as high as the MM supplier in Antares and are often quite high here so you can sell some of your fuel on the market for good profit. Right now my spreadsheet indicates that current market prices provide a profit margin of about 200 AIC/hour for each REF you have! I'm only asking for a small amount of help with corp demand so you should still have plenty of fuel to sell on market! @jackinabox86 and I have built supply lines for all fuel inputs so we can supply you materials at discounted prices until you can get some of your own sources üôÇ

Reply here if you're interested and we can start a conversation. I'm happy to answer any questions if you have some


[13-Dec-22 12:09 PM] churavis#0000
Where would you suggest a REF base go?


[13-Dec-22 12:25 PM] jackinabox86#0000
maybe Aceland?


[13-Dec-22 12:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Nike works if you want the corp bonus, but it's usually better used for construction in my mind


[13-Dec-22 12:26 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I would suggest Nike if you don't plan on using the space for construction. There are no fuel refining COGC's in Antares and I have yet to find a good target planet to make one so the HQ bonus we get on Nike is a step up on any competition


[13-Dec-22 12:27 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Plus I can supply the new base easily because that's where I make my fuel too. And it would be close to the Nike/Deimos traffic that we need to supply


[13-Dec-22 12:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Honestly, I think we should close down the Deimos fuel station @yjhasaday


[13-Dec-22 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
it's just a ton of extra work for you.  I don't think we have anyone on Deimos who isn't at ANT or Nike


[13-Dec-22 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
and you have to ship fuel around that you're already selling at a discount!


[13-Dec-22 12:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
the DLR idea of gas stations across ANT is dead, so we should put the nail in Deimos


[13-Dec-22 12:38 PM] churavis#0000
If you close down Deimos then I'll be buying a lot more SF on ANT instead since I don't usually go from Nike to Deimos


[13-Dec-22 12:39 PM] jackinabox86#0000
fine, I just added two REFs


[13-Dec-22 12:39 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Awww man, I would feel bad chopping Deimos though, it seems to be the busiest of our gas stations so I'm sure it would cause problems for those that stock up there


[13-Dec-22 12:39 PM] churavis#0000
That would move production burden from YJ14 to Jackinabox


[13-Dec-22 12:40 PM] yjhasaday#0000
What if we did a poll among the corp? To officially survey where people want to buy their fuel?


[13-Dec-22 12:41 PM] yjhasaday#0000
We could have two poll questions: Where you would prefer to buy your fuel? And Where you would have difficulty re-fueling? (ie. planets you don't frequent)


[13-Dec-22 12:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
works for me


[13-Dec-22 12:42 PM] churavis#0000
Now that I have all MFL tanks I  wouldn't mind getting it all from ANT since most my trips begin or end there anyways


[13-Dec-22 12:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm also happy for Lamda to take up some of the ANT demand


[13-Dec-22 12:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I view my fuel making as a service to the corp for all the easy growth it afforded me


[13-Dec-22 04:16 PM] churavis#0000
We should find a planet in Antares to turn into a fuel producer, the whole market could use it


[13-Dec-22 04:55 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I didn‚Äôt find anything decent that only needs mcg or sea


[13-Dec-22 04:56 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I‚Äôm not paying more for inputs to a low margin good like guel


[13-Dec-22 04:56 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I‚Äôm moving some low priority construction stuff to Acetares and will do fuel there as well. Adding refs. Have to move from qj 650 bc of the switch to POL there


[13-Dec-22 06:27 PM] exeler#0000
Are there any blank planets that we could use and just ship stuff to it?

Or is shipping the inputs for fuel production not a great plan?


[13-Dec-22 07:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I've always shipped the inputs.  Not ideal, but given the number of ships available to us, it's not impossible


[13-Dec-22 07:43 PM] jackinabox86#0000
the issue is that all the decent blank or SEA planets in the region are used for other COGCs, rightly given their comparative importance


[13-Dec-22 07:46 PM] gladeowl#0000
Would it be feasible to turn one of the INS/AEF planets into one. Given possible cheap supply of INS and AEF?


[13-Dec-22 07:46 PM] jackinabox86#0000
INS costs way more than HSE in my experience. a bit easier to repair, but still wildly more expensive than MCG/SEA


[13-Dec-22 07:46 PM] jackinabox86#0000
fuel isn't making us any money


[13-Dec-22 07:50 PM] exeler#0000
Would a dedicated home for fuel production make it a more profitable industry to get into?

And wouldn't raising the corp prices for fuel make it a little better as well? I definitely wouldn't mind paying more for fuel (I actually still get most of mine from the CX) if that enables more reasonable options for making it.


[13-Dec-22 08:08 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I thought INS was better due to the breakpoints on repair costs?


[13-Dec-22 08:14 PM] yuen8241#0000
There is a special MCG fuel planet near Griff.


[13-Dec-22 08:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
But it's too far from the raw material producing area.


[13-Dec-22 08:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
The ideal fuel planet should be close to raw materials and CX. After all, it is impossible for the Corp to consume so much fuel.


[13-Dec-22 08:17 PM] yuen8241#0000

[13-Dec-22 08:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
The biggest problem in the fuel industry is that it consumes too much transport capacity relative to the profits gained.


[13-Dec-22 08:27 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
You need to build a fuel System with a shipyard and all the inputs in one System


[13-Dec-22 08:28 PM] churavis#0000
Shipyards are ludicrously expensive, as in dozens of each type of Afab expensive


[13-Dec-22 08:30 PM] gladeowl#0000
If setting up in the ANT system, we could give massive discounts on certain building materials to corp members building on the designated fuel planet, in an effort to make it easier.


[13-Dec-22 08:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
Actually, we can build a fuel industry in hortus or benten, where there are very mature supporting facilities. We can also choose deimos system.


[13-Dec-22 08:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
There is a cx price ceiling for fuel products, so as inflation intensifies, unless the development team raises this price, I don't think this industry is suitable for making money. We can make consumables and use the money we earn to buy more fuel. I think we can buy fuel in each CX as a long-term reserve.


[19-Dec-22 02:15 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm curious, are players limited to one account each? If not, then theoretically someone could maintain a dedicated fuel broker/storage entity for the corporation that strictly deals with internal fuel stockpiling.


[19-Dec-22 02:15 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ooga Booga Refueling Co.


[19-Dec-22 02:15 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah, players are only allowed a single account


[19-Dec-22 02:16 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahh figured as much. Ah well.


[19-Dec-22 02:19 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
There is probably not even that much room in the economy to dedicate a player to making fuel due to the MM price cap so your potential profit is limited compared to other activities


[19-Dec-22 02:20 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Right. That's part of why I COLIQ's as a fuel rat on Benten. Its just inherently limited in ways other industries aren't.


[19-Dec-22 03:45 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I will say that once you create low cost supply chains fuel actually gets really profitable - especially in Antares where the lack of available inputs drives competition away and prices up. I think a lot of people underrate it but I built my whole empire on the fuel industry üòé even if its profitability is lower you can make LARGE amounts of it very fast.


[19-Dec-22 03:56 PM] churavis#0000
Quantity over margin is why Black Friday exists


[19-Dec-22 05:02 PM] domicius#0000
Eventually you'll need to get into different industries. I built up on MCG but now I barely make it.


[19-Dec-22 06:49 PM] exeler#0000
I started with C and it is still the backbone of basically everything I do.


[19-Dec-22 06:50 PM] churavis#0000
I started with MCG and made a killing with cheap LST from DLR


[08-Jan-23 01:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
What sorts of industry are we currently in need of? Looking into base #4 and am open to ideas. üôÇ I currently do AL on Deimos; FRMs on Harmonia; and FP-DW on Heph (future relocation likely). Might be time for me to get into a more intermediate level industry?


[08-Jan-23 01:28 AM] erklein#0000
You can go to Griffonstone and get started in chemistry. Either making FLX for your own AL chain, or more likely PG and EPO since those are always in demand somewhere. I also find it to be a slower industry compared to others so getting started earlier means having the experts sooner. Or go to Nike for that sweet 10% corp HQ bonus


[08-Jan-23 01:31 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm, that's an idea. What do folks mostly do on Nike? I know its a construction planet, but like, do we mostly do lower tier mats, higher tier, or is it fairly mixed?


[08-Jan-23 01:34 AM] erklein#0000
Probably mostly lower PP2 due to easy access to LST and AL, as bfabs and lfabs are what you're going to mostly use. You can also set up WEL since TRU are high priced right now. For PP3 and PP4, you're going to need a lot of outside infrastructure/industries to keep them up and running, or be prepared to pay whatever the CX dictates


[08-Jan-23 01:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Noted. Thanks for the advice, bud. I'll probably go for PP2/WEL. All of my other bases are pure pioneer workforces, but I'm assuming PP2+/WEL tip over into the higher upkeep boyos, so it should be interesting. üôÇ


[08-Jan-23 01:37 AM] exeler#0000
I recommend PG/EPO on Griff. That was my third base (after C on Harm, and AL on Deimos). EPO especially is pretty lucrative

[08-Jan-23 05:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
@xenoxerarchIf you want, I can sponsor a CHP base for CL production. At present, there is no stable CL supplier in the company.


[08-Jan-23 05:32 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I mean, if its in demand, and there's inputs available, and profit to be made, then win-win.


[08-Jan-23 05:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can quickly recover your investment in producing CL, and the only thing you need to pay attention to is the supply of HAL.


[08-Jan-23 05:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
This base is worth about 500k. I can sponsor you in return for giving me the priority to purchase CL.


[08-Jan-23 06:25 AM] domicius#0000
I've got 200CL on ZV-759d if you want.


[08-Jan-23 06:26 AM] yuen8241#0000

[08-Jan-23 07:44 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Sounds like a plan.


[08-Jan-23 08:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Here's an idea: a PP2 on Nike + AL inputs (at corp prices) = cheap BSE = cheap resource bases...
Then find a resource in demand and scope out those planets.


[08-Jan-23 08:31 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's... a really clever idea.


[08-Jan-23 08:33 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Sounds like the optimal path would be to do the CL sponsor base, save up my profits from each of my (as of today) fully-built bases, invest in a Nike base mat production facility as I go, and use that to have fun finding a resource demand to harvest. Yeah, I like that idea a lot. üôÇ


[08-Jan-23 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
Chemistry base for EPO is great, if you make a construction base on Nike, a few PP3s can use an entire planet's production. And there seems to be a constant need for rfabs out of PP3s also. So there's two bases üòÑ


[08-Jan-23 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think my profit on my WELs is poor. My overpriced TRUs weren't really selling. My WELs also make MHL but that's more of a hobby project than a profit driver.


[08-Jan-23 11:31 AM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, WEL isn't more than a 1  or 2 per person thing, unless you need something off it for a later chain (I use it for engine production)


[08-Jan-23 11:31 AM] jackinabox86#0000
just keep in mind if you go construction on Nike all your AL will go to that, not to profit


[08-Jan-23 11:32 AM] jackinabox86#0000
there's money in selling prefabs, but you want to think through all that.  The CL base is a great idea


[08-Jan-23 11:32 AM] churavis#0000
If you make your own AL, bfabs and lfabs are quite profitable


[08-Jan-23 03:12 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
PP3 might not be the best to get into right now unless you focus on INS, I'm sitting on a stockpile of rfabs

still more profitable than INS https://universallogistics.app/building/PP3


[08-Jan-23 05:18 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm. Plenty to consider. I'll definitely do the CL chem base, at least, for now. The rest I'll figure out later. Should mean more time to eye market trends and figure what we're lacking/producing in excess.


[08-Jan-23 05:20 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
With how much things seem to have shifted up, down, and sideways since I joined a month ago, we'll see what happens üôÇ (I still totally want a nike base though lol, just seems silly not to have a corp HQ base)


[08-Jan-23 05:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
How much do you sell TRUs for? There's currently 6x 30 TRU ads on Deimos at 5k CIS/c (166u/180 TRU/30k)


[08-Jan-23 05:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Judging by how long the ads have been up, I'm guessing that's super underpriced


[08-Jan-23 06:02 PM] erklein#0000
I know that TRU were stable at ~225/u for a while on the CX. It was about a month ago where the prices doubled or more


[08-Jan-23 06:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, 200/u is sort of what I consider "normal". The spread is really large on the CX, but if I sell em at 600 I'll be pretty pleased. looks like 100 units per day seems fairly typical. Not sure who made the huge purchases recently or why.


[08-Jan-23 06:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
@xenoxerarchYou can send me the sales contract of 500k AIC, and the goods are 1FF on ANT.


[08-Jan-23 06:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
This money must be enough to build a CL base on Griff.

Oh okay, I was going to go poke each of them individually but that works too üôÇ


[19-Jan-23 07:35 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm going to sponsor FRM base in harmonia and INC base in nascent. If anyone is interested.


[20-Jan-23 01:55 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I'm still in the 7 day trial period, but as my second base I was already planning for a FRM base on Harmonia. So yes, I would be interested. üôÇ


[20-Jan-23 05:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
Due to the past lessons, my requirements for Sponsored person are to become a shareholder, sell products to Corp, and play for more than 30 days.


[20-Jan-23 05:20 AM] neth_havoc#0000
@yuen8241 That is okay, fair enough!


[20-Jan-23 05:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
We'll discuss this sponsorship then. Now we can discuss whether we can cooperate in the metallurgical industry on deimos.


[26-Jan-23 09:53 AM] neth_havoc#0000
While I'm preparing everything for my FRM Base on Harmonia I'm already thinking about base #3. For now I have a base on Deimos producing AL.
Is there something the corp needs or do you have any suggestions? Having a base on Nike someday is something I do consider, but maybe not now.


[26-Jan-23 10:05 AM] domicius#0000
@yuen8241 is sponsoring CHM bases to produce EPO and PG I believe


[26-Jan-23 12:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
A Norwick FP base is a natural fit with a Harmonia FRM base, although it generally takes more than one FRM base to cover for a FP base, so if you're not struggling to sell your FRM products, that's not necessary.


[26-Jan-23 12:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect we're good on H2O bases


[26-Jan-23 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
So a plastics base is a good call, like Domicius said. Griffonstone is a good choice. I also have one on Antares II D making EPO.


[26-Jan-23 12:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Otherwise, is there any particular chain you're interested in?


[26-Jan-23 12:57 PM] churavis#0000
Plastics is a good call only if you have a good source of C lined up

[26-Jan-23 09:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you can solve the problem of C, it's good to do plastic business. Otherwise, you can consider coming to griff to do CL.


[26-Jan-23 09:36 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I just moved my INC to Nascent, should be enough C for my PG base, 2x EPO bases and some SME

I don't have a C base, so plastics better not.


[28-Jan-23 03:25 AM] neth_havoc#0000
The CL on Griff is needed by the corp?


[28-Jan-23 03:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, I have lent money to build two and given away one (although it is gone).


[28-Jan-23 03:27 AM] neth_havoc#0000
So I would import water and produce CL to sell to the corp?


[28-Jan-23 03:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
yes


[28-Jan-23 03:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
How many bases do you have?


[28-Jan-23 03:28 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Is it a good idea to later get LST from Nike (buying or extract it myself), transport it to griff to produce the FLX and then transport it to Deimos?


[28-Jan-23 03:29 AM] neth_havoc#0000
My 2nd base on Harmonia will be up tomorrow.


[28-Jan-23 03:29 AM] yuen8241#0000
It is better to produce CL


[28-Jan-23 03:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you can reach a stable cooperation with a HAL manufacturer, you can even just build CHP.


[28-Jan-23 03:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
I bought all my FLX from ben now.


[28-Jan-23 03:48 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Doing more in Metallurgy maybe it needed by the corp?!


[28-Jan-23 03:48 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Planning to have a base on Nike later to produce fabs. For now I'm happy supplying the AL to the corp.


[28-Jan-23 03:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
In addition to CL, you can also produce C.


[28-Jan-23 03:49 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Do we have enough fuel producers?


[28-Jan-23 03:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
Then PE or PG.


[28-Jan-23 03:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you don't have a stable production capacity of C, or you don't have sufficient ship capacity, you can't stably produce these things that consume a lot of C.


[28-Jan-23 03:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, I feel that our fabs production capacity is enough, and what is lacking is metals Ôºåplastic and chemicals.


[28-Jan-23 03:52 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Which metals are lacking?


[28-Jan-23 03:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
AL can never be too much. Besides, there is a lack of ti


[28-Jan-23 03:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
The consumption of CU and AU is relatively small and they are heavy, which is not suitable for you.


[28-Jan-23 03:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
The production capacity of FE and STL is enough, and HSE is still too expensive for you.


[28-Jan-23 03:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you want to make money, you should produce chemicals and the Corp needs chemicals.


[28-Jan-23 03:59 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can also go to heph to produce some mcg, pe, cot and the like, and I will buy them for a long time.


[28-Jan-23 08:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
There‚Äôs never enough C if you‚Äôve upgraded you starting ships and can do that yourself


[28-Jan-23 08:04 AM] jackinabox86#0000
But I think CL and later fabs is great


[28-Jan-23 08:04 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Fab demand is inexhaustible


[28-Jan-23 08:04 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Ok, I'm in on having a CL Base in Griff, leaving room to expand to have also LABs later on.


[28-Jan-23 08:06 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I'm just planning the setup to fit in the end in 500 in PRUNner.

Looks great Neth! What are you planning on using the Labs for? My lab time is always constrained. I make DDT, NR, TCL, and BL (I have one of the few F extraction bases)


[31-Jan-23 01:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
If Yuen isn't sponsoring this base, I will be happy to üòÑ


[31-Jan-23 03:10 PM] neth_havoc#0000
For the LABs I was thinking about TCL, BLE maybe also DDT, depends on what is needed.


[31-Jan-23 03:11 PM] neth_havoc#0000
If you can supply F then I could also do BL.


[31-Jan-23 03:12 PM] neth_havoc#0000

Unless you've got a reason not to


[31-Jan-23 04:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
One note is that you can produce a lot of CL out of that base- more than you can consume making EPO. So it depends on what your LAB is doing if you're using that CL


[31-Jan-23 04:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you have an opportunity to further refine a product on planet (and also within the same Chemistry COGC) it's usually worth it


[31-Jan-23 04:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
but if you have a goal to use that up with DDT or TCL, that's cool too.


[31-Jan-23 04:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh and maybe double check the cost on the habs, HB1s, 2s, and 3s, might be cheaper than the mixed buildings, even if there's extra population room.

[31-Jan-23 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Do you have a LAB output in mind?


[31-Jan-23 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
The galaxy-wide demand for BAC is pretty low


[31-Jan-23 04:34 PM] neth_havoc#0000
I'll take your suggestions, I'm new to the Chem business?! üòÖ


[31-Jan-23 05:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
DDT is probably the best option generally. I make BL and BAC, but that's only cause I can use them directly. TCL makes KV, which is very profitable, but it's usually sold as KV after the weaving process.


[31-Jan-23 05:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll certainly help supply you with F for BL or NCS to make NR... but that's mostly just cause I use all those üòÑ


[31-Jan-23 05:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Here's a similar layout pointed more towards EPO production, which should sell really well and reliably, with good net profit and lower payback period

It's pretty close to balanced on HALK and CL. You could swap a STO for an EXT if you want a buffer on HAL.

not sure, but you can play around with it, the SME won't have a bonus, shipping is probably valued around 50/TIO.


[10-Feb-23 09:51 AM] allocater#0000
50 production cost + 50 shipping cost -> 100 sold at 150 for 150% profit

[13-Feb-23 03:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
Is anyone interested in this base?


[13-Feb-23 03:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can sponsor or provide a loan. I will buy products such as PE, COT and NL. BMP can also produce many consumables and materials, such as MCG, EXO, PWO, OVE, PT and OFF.


[13-Feb-23 03:31 AM] yuen8241#0000
PE is a material that needs to be consumed in electronics, manufacturing and shipbuilding.


[13-Feb-23 03:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
Another design is suitable for people who are very lacking in transportation ability. Just transport some PG and sell NL and PSL.

[13-Feb-23 03:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
This design can help to produce some KV and charge some processing fees.


[13-Feb-23 03:38 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Basically yes, I was interested in a Heph Base anyway for consumables (although was thinking about a Nike base first.).


[13-Feb-23 03:39 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Although I might not produce so much PE, because of the C consumption. I can buy that on Nascent, but I can only transport 222 at a time with my ships.


[13-Feb-23 03:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you prefer to produce consumables, I can provide loans.


[13-Feb-23 03:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
I don't need consumables very much, because I have produced enough myself. I need a stable source of PE for me or other shipbuilding participants.


[13-Feb-23 03:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering the short cost recovery period of producing consumables, it is estimated that it only takes 10 days to recover the cost.

[13-Feb-23 04:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
You want this plan? Then you can send me two contracts. One is 800k AIC to sell me 1 FTL, and the other is 800k AIC to buy me 1FTL. The payment performance period of the second contract can be 2 months.


[13-Feb-23 04:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, you can pay it back in a month.


[13-Feb-23 04:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
Heph's SET and PIO is still sufficient.


[13-Feb-23 04:37 AM] neth_havoc#0000

Does anyone want Nike's pp1, pp2 and ext mixed bases? I can provide sponsorship/loan. The loan can be repaid by BSE/BBH/BDE.


[22-Feb-23 10:32 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you don't have a deimos base to provide AL, I can sponsor/loan together. If your transportation capacity is limited, I can provide WCB upgrade package as a sponsor.


[22-Feb-23 10:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
The WCB upgrade package is only available to those whose two initial ships have not been upgraded.


[22-Feb-23 10:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
In addition, I provide griff's EXT base sponsorship/loan.


[22-Feb-23 11:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
Another optional project is the PPF/WPL base of Heph.


[23-Feb-23 01:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will likely set up a PPF/WPL base on Heph. I suspect I'll use all the Kevlar it can produce, however. So we'll still need more.


[23-Feb-23 02:28 PM] churavis#0000
Do you have a good source of PG/TCL?


[23-Feb-23 02:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I make TCL on Griff. PG I'd buy on the CX.


[23-Feb-23 02:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
this is also my plan for next base, though only 3 KV/d or so, but I have no designated output

[23-Feb-23 02:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
worst case the price on the CX is quite high for KV


[23-Feb-23 02:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
But I'd buy it too. I usually make ASE, but make ADE when I have KV

{Reactions}
üëç 

[23-Feb-23 05:29 PM] exeler#0000
Depending on how much PG you need I can probably supply that. 

I already fly from Griff to Heph with PG, but I can produce waaaaay more PG than I need myself.


[23-Feb-23 07:47 PM] jackinabox86#0000
In the unlikely event there is KV available, I would always buy it


[23-Feb-23 07:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
The current situation is that the production of KV does not make money, but the production of TCl makes money. KV consumes too much TCL.


[23-Feb-23 07:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
I can sponsor WPL base, usually produce NL or COT, and help me process KV occasionally. I'll pay the processing fee


[23-Feb-23 07:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
WPL takes up too much space.


[23-Feb-23 07:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
My production capacity has increased to 10 KV/day, but it is just enough for me. This leads me to import a lot of CL.


[23-Feb-23 07:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
@hernanduerYou can get the PPF/WPL base from me for free.


[23-Feb-23 07:55 PM] yuen8241#0000
After A1E is completed, I will have three manufacturing bases, and then I may realize a certain degree PSL\PE\KV freedom.üòÖ

After also having repaid my 800k Base sponsoring to @yuen8241  (thx again!) I'm planning my two next bases.


[24-Feb-23 11:48 AM] neth_havoc#0000
I think about a FP base in Norwick, because Harmonia alone wont do it. But before that I will need a Water base on Ice Station Alpha.


[24-Feb-23 11:49 AM] neth_havoc#0000
Does someone like to sponsor that water base? ü•π


[24-Feb-23 11:54 AM] hernanduer#0000

I have up to 500 MUS, NUT, MAI on Norwick, and also some BEA, up to 100 HER, up to 100 CAF if you want to make any of that also.


[24-Feb-23 12:27 PM] neth_havoc#0000
I haven't looked that much into the profit and more in the volume of water I will need. People here suggested to build one on ISA, because corp mates won't produce so much extra and on CX the price is 23. Etherwind would be much cheaper to build, but further away.


[24-Feb-23 12:27 PM] neth_havoc#0000
Will do that.


[24-Feb-23 12:28 PM] neth_havoc#0000
For the prices I would just use corp prices?!


[24-Feb-23 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
probably


[24-Feb-23 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can pad em a bit if you want, but I'll probably just be reselling them in-corp, at corp prices üòÑ


[24-Feb-23 12:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a full ISA base. I can bring a ship over to norwick. It can't keep up with an all-DW base though, because I use the water on a few planets. I can't _guarantee_ a certain steady amount out of it (because I haven't done the math), but I have a general sense you could get water in corp.. especially if you are mixing in other FP products. It's very easy to substitute other things into an FP planet.

I'm interested in sponsoring someone to run a TI extraction/smelting base on KI-401b.  Could be anything from rent-a-permit (I'll provide the construction materials, consumables, inputs, and pay a stipend) to just helping with materials and providing a guaranteed on-planet market, or anything in between.


[22-Sep-23 08:12 AM] melon164#0000
You'd need to be PRO (or BASIC if you're prepared to do a lot of shipping contract finangling)


[06-Oct-23 09:48 PM] churavis#0000
I think we need to sponsor an ALO base on Nascent or Deimos


[07-Oct-23 02:50 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Yea, ore would be nice. Don't want to build lots of extractors on non-RE planet


[07-Oct-23 04:45 AM] mrsmith33#0000
IY-816c is one jump to Nascent and has ALO

[12-Oct-23 11:06 AM] mrsmith33#0000
It looks like KI-401b does resource extraction CoGC. The system in general looks pretty good. Could make a bunch of 500 area smelting bases in there

Should I expect to sell it at 80/u on CX?


[20-Oct-23 12:55 PM] churavis#0000
It's going for almost twice that much on the CX right now and could go higher given that prices on other CX aren't much lower.

You definitely want to get your base up and running as quick as possible before to many others get the same idea.


[20-Oct-23 12:59 PM] churavis#0000
You can send us contracts for the mats needed with long payment tails or send us sell contracts for hydrogen that we pay up front and you fill when you can or just take out another loan.


[24-Oct-23 12:02 PM] churavis#0000
Did you make a decision on whether or not to set up a hydrogen base?


[24-Oct-23 12:02 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I will do it. Already crafting some building materials


[24-Oct-23 12:04 PM] churavis#0000
Just send me contracts for them with a long tail and pay them off whenever you need.


[24-Oct-23 12:04 PM] rune_242#0000
No need


[24-Oct-23 12:04 PM] rune_242#0000
I overproduce a LOT of H


[24-Oct-23 12:05 PM] rune_242#0000
I just don't have the shipping capability


[24-Oct-23 12:05 PM] churavis#0000
I've got a carrier on ANT right now with nothing to do, send me a contract


[24-Oct-23 12:07 PM] churavis#0000
I do think that it would be a good idea to build a hydrogen base as Antares needs it and it's a great low capital, fast ROI base


[24-Oct-23 12:08 PM] churavis#0000
I've got CQL and BR1 in stock for tankers


[24-Oct-23 12:10 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Are those 900k and 700k respectively?


[24-Oct-23 12:12 PM] churavis#0000
Correct


[24-Oct-23 12:14 PM] rune_242#0000
2k or 3k?


[24-Oct-23 12:16 PM] churavis#0000
Carriers are 2kt/2kv, tankers are 1kt/3kv


[24-Oct-23 12:21 PM] rune_242#0000
ahhh


[24-Oct-23 12:25 PM] churavis#0000
Haulers are 3kt/1kv and anything smaller is a runner


[24-Oct-23 12:47 PM] mrsmith33#0000
What's RCT price?


[24-Oct-23 12:55 PM] churavis#0000
The ship-building channel has a pinned message with the standard prices for ship parts


[24-Oct-23 12:56 PM] mrsmith33#0000
yes, I'm looking at it and can't find RCT there


[24-Oct-23 02:38 PM] mrsmith33#0000
So Tanker is 5.1M + base is 1.7M = 6.8M
0 expert COGM is 10.2AIC/u 1030u/day
5 expert COGM is 8AIC/u 1330u/day
at 140/u -> 130 in profit. 
at optimistic rate of 140/u, at 5 experts, ROI is 36.5 days
pessimistic is 66 days
(does not include taxes and fuel cost)


[24-Oct-23 02:40 PM] churavis#0000
It can also serve as a good base for expanding into industries that use H like PE and PG, which are also in high demand and have better margins and support many even higher tier, higher margin production lines


[24-Oct-23 02:46 PM] mrsmith33#0000
More profitable would be to establish my own food processing base on Norwick (which is in my plans). This will drive costs down on all of my bases


[24-Oct-23 02:50 PM] churavis#0000
That's up to you but RAT is always expensive while H may go down in price at some point


[24-Oct-23 02:52 PM] mrsmith33#0000
That a con to H mining


[24-Oct-23 02:52 PM] churavis#0000
That depends on how quickly you get the base up


[24-Oct-23 02:53 PM] mrsmith33#0000
It is not like ROI period is very short to cover temporarily increased price


[24-Oct-23 02:55 PM] hernanduer#0000

Is there anyone willing to build a HAL extraction base on YK-005d to take over for Rune?


[03-Feb-24 03:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can look into it once I finish my expansion on Griffonstone - do you have a rough idea how much HAL would be needed?


[03-Feb-24 03:58 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I have a base there, only 3 EXT atm, the rest of space is occupied by INC


[03-Feb-24 06:38 PM] churavis#0000
Are you willing to replace your INC with EXT or should we have someone else build a HAL base?


[03-Feb-24 06:43 PM] melon164#0000
I can build a HAL base if people will handle the shipping from it


[03-Feb-24 07:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
just build as many EXTs as you can and sell or process the excess


[03-Feb-24 07:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
HAL is a super valuable and profitable pipeline


[03-Feb-24 07:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
Very true (that's why I'm expanding on Griffonstone üòÑ )


[03-Feb-24 07:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll have two free permits sometime tomorrow, so I can go ahead and throw down 14 EXT on YK-005d. Sponsorship is always welcome, but I can ~~probably~~ definitely afford it in a few days once some of my stuff sells


[03-Feb-24 07:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
(griffonstone is my first experience with settlers - some of those luxuries can get expensive ü•≤ )


[03-Feb-24 09:10 PM] churavis#0000
The problem with you building the HAL base is that you couldn't send people sell contracts, and the warehouse on YK-005d isn't big enough for a full hauler load, so it would be really hard to get sell the HAL to people as you'd have to do multiple buy contracts and either both be on at the same time or leave the ship there for a while waiting for the other to get on.


[03-Feb-24 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
give me an amount and i'll send you a cont for the price of the materials and a week or so of consumables


[03-Feb-24 09:36 PM] churavis#0000
Just have Rune give you all the leftovers from his base


[03-Feb-24 10:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
@rune_242 ^ would that work for you? If so, I can handle sending all the contracts - just send me a screenshot of the stuff üôÇ


[04-Feb-24 03:30 AM] melon164#0000
This is a very fair point; what I've done in the past is expand the warehouse on planets I sell from, so buyers can marshal a whole ship's worth of stock before picking up.  But I admit it's more of a faff than having a PRO seller.


[04-Feb-24 01:52 PM] draconisdomini#0000

[20-May-24 10:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
Because 1) It's the most technicians I can pack into 500 area, and 2) I like TCL


[20-May-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
So one option: I can bring everything up for someone to make and run the base for 30d.. and you give me the TCL then after that you can have the base and do what you want with it.


[20-May-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
Or I can bring everything up and supply the base longer term, then pay you for the permit


[20-May-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also open to other arrangements


[20-May-24 10:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
It would be a 10% boost to employed technicians on the planet, thus a 10% boost to engineer education


[20-May-24 10:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I can if no one else takes you up on it


[20-May-24 10:53 AM] allocater#0000
I was thinking the same, but with 17 SD for 850 TEC, or 11 TNP for 880 TEC and then leave the base idle üòÑ But if you like TCL, LAB is better


[20-May-24 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I thought about leaving a base idle


[20-May-24 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Although the SDs _could_ be useful products too


[20-May-24 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I slightly overproduce CL and I've accumulated a lot of it over the last year

I would like to sponsor an ALO base on Nascent. I'm sure I'm not the only corp member hurting for ALO. I'll give you all the building MATs. If you're level 10 HQ or less and you need a permit I'll give you the MAT's for an upgrade. I'd even give you a BR1 and CQM if transportation is an issue, though I'm perfectly fine purchasing ALO on planet and transporting it myself.


[18-Jun-24 11:28 PM] tuffyless#0000
If no takers, then I'll volunteer for this Nascent permit.
Im one of those in need of more ALO anyways.

My next permit level is 29.
That equals:  299 ABH, 199 ADE & ASE, 99 ATA.

I'll pay for everyone one of those Afabs, at the routine corp price, if our members have enough [*or are willing to plan to*] produced collectively.  
Pretty sure I have enough in the bank to pay for them all right now.

That kinda sounds like a win-win for everyone, esp if there are OOG members looking for AIC in trade for their short-term PP4 time, topped off with a surplus of ALO being available.

My math tells me that'll produce ~650 ALO/d with 14 EXT's.

Currently, my shipping capacity wont accommodate that volume, to get all that ALO to ANT regularly.  

Can figure that detail out later though.
The cost of the new boat [*and base construction*] is negligible compared to the permit.

Been able to manage but am about to hit that redline. haha


[18-Jun-24 11:43 PM] tuffyless#0000
If a reliable member wants it instead, I encourage it.
I'll be happy to buy ALO regularly from that member.

But if not, just saying - I'll put that win/win/win offer on the table. üôÇ

Hopefully an OOG reads & is interested in Nascent, for less effort.  Dunno how many of us there are but at least 2 can benefit from more ALO.

It would be a very low effort base. No inputs and selling it on planet means no logistics, just accepting a few contracts each week.


[19-Jun-24 12:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe @megasaberexe  or @laichonious  or @darjaves  or @.zogii or @fishhd ?

Seems like a no-brainer to me:

(a) Be given the MAT's to build a base, 
(b) Get paid for the production from it via contracts, 
(c) Be given very expensive ship-parts to build & transport the extras,
(d) And be given the HQ upgrades to make it all happen.


[19-Jun-24 12:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Do you want my extra 30/d ALO production?


[19-Jun-24 12:26 AM] churavis#0000
My offer very specifically limited the free HQ upgrades to a certain level since I don't have a ton of PP4 or PP3 capacity to spare


[19-Jun-24 12:26 AM] churavis#0000
I need about 230/d extra ALO production


[19-Jun-24 12:26 AM] tuffyless#0000
Understood but the lower-HQ wont need all that

I could commit cardinal sins and multi permit my Nascent base


[19-Jun-24 12:29 AM] tuffyless#0000
I wouldnt.  IMO.  You'd have to be replaced when you get to the point of needing to expand.


[19-Jun-24 12:30 AM] churavis#0000
You could move your INC to some other RE planet, I did that a bit


[19-Jun-24 12:30 AM] tuffyless#0000
or that üôÇ  Didnt realize INC were in play for you @ Nascent


[19-Jun-24 12:31 AM] churavis#0000
I'm pretty sure there are more INC than EXT on Nascent

So INC's move to 110d then that frees up area on Nascent, you mean?

Yeah potentially


[19-Jun-24 12:37 AM] churavis#0000

for nascent?


[19-Jun-24 12:57 AM] tuffyless#0000
or 110d.  however you allocate it?  
Can give a ~months worth to get the operation on it's feet.


[19-Jun-24 12:58 AM] .urpalhal#0000
ok 110d will work better

With all said, you might well plan to begin saving for another boat üôÇ


[19-Jun-24 01:26 AM] .urpalhal#0000
in 5 hours my other ship will be at Moria and then in 24 more hours from that it will be back at ANT so I can upgrade it to a WCB, but I need like 2 more WCB ships just for Halcyon....


[19-Jun-24 01:47 AM] akyantor#0000
I might be interested. I actually had this plan for Nascent as one of my options to incrementally move towards some kind of construction (mix of SME/EXT) using the AL within my own supply chain:  https://prunplanner.org/shared/8c1d4fbf-cde3-4351-ac68-a5db65d07a7f

That said, I'd don't think I'd be able to use the amount of AL this produces for my own purposes for a while, and I'd have logistic issues moving it off planet until I get another ship or WCB upgrades. 

I've just shipped out the materials necessary to upgrade my HQ from 3->4, which unlocks the ability for me to pick a next planet for expansion. *I'd at some point use some of the output of the Nascent.. which is why I held back when I first saw the message.*


[19-Jun-24 02:17 AM] exeler#0000
I run a ton of SME and would buy ALO. I use ~380/d and produce 0/d


[19-Jun-24 02:18 AM] exeler#0000
I also have the convenient problem of needing to ship things to Nascent more than I need to ship away from Nascent. So happy to shuttle ALO back to ANT


[19-Jun-24 02:36 AM] tuffyless#0000
haha dang.  
380 ALO/d (Exeler) + 230 ALO/d (Churavis) + 150 ALO/d (Tuffy)
Might we need a 2nd Nascent volunteer?  ü§î


[19-Jun-24 08:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
Higgsy used to extract ALO on nascent. Anyway I‚Äôd probably buy there too if someone had extra and was running auctions.


[19-Jun-24 08:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have free SP and probably have a bit of POW on ANT


[19-Jun-24 08:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
I still have a selection of bfabs and rfabs (and afabs) on ANT from Higgsy. We can put those right back to work extracting ALO üòÑ

[19-Jun-24 08:33 PM] tuffyless#0000
@.urpalhal  Maybe not the channel for this but  my chicken-scratch is here.  We can take to private DM if you like.  Make corrections as you see them.

COF - 180  x 500 = 90k
DW  - 1440 x 60  = 86.4k
OVE - 180  x 75  = 13.5k
PWO - 72   x 200 = 14.4k
RAT - 1440 x 70  = 100.8k
---
CONs Fronted - 305.1k

ALO  Payback - 305.1k / 60 = 5,085 ALO

[19-Jun-24 08:41 PM] tuffyless#0000
To 110d.  
ok I can but got no boats at ANT currently.  
None currently en-route either.

So I can collect from your INV if you like and send the next time a boat heads there.


[19-Jun-24 08:42 PM] tuffyless#0000

It's the same result though.  
Still 2 - 3 days if gotta goto Ant then Nascent.


[19-Jun-24 08:46 PM] tuffyless#0000
I'll earmark a boat to goto ANT asap.
You send the MAT's you want moved.
And tell me if they're destined for Nascent or 110d.
Then I'll move them. üôÇ


[19-Jun-24 09:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Sorry for that confusion Hal.  
My dumbass mis-read your destination originally, which led us down a rabbit hole.

I will have 1.1K ALO in 12 hours


[30-Jun-24 07:16 PM] tuffyless#0000
A 2k/2k boat can carry 1481 ALO and I dont have a base on Nascent yet.  Grrr.  
Can you send a sell contd for 1481 and I'll send a ship so can pick it up when I get there [*and after you have/provision of course*]?


[30-Jun-24 07:19 PM] tuffyless#0000
--Or are you saying you'll have 1.1k ALO on ANT in 12 hours?  haha sorry to spam.


[30-Jun-24 07:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok let me do then math then


[30-Jun-24 07:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So my next batch finishes at like 1AM for me


[30-Jun-24 07:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
7 hours


[30-Jun-24 07:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The next batch would finish at 10 AM or so


[30-Jun-24 07:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
That would be 1100+210 so 1310


[30-Jun-24 07:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The next after that would be 7 PM and that would be 1310+210 so 1520


[30-Jun-24 07:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So in 25 hours I can fill your ship

@churavis Ive got another 1481 ALO on Nascent


[07-Jul-24 11:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000
and good news I'm at 92.9% to the fifth expert so more ALO!


[07-Jul-24 11:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
cancel `CONT FLAFWBL`


[07-Jul-24 11:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
`CONT 58VCDLP` is the right one


[09-Jul-24 02:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
@archielvahr  I took a look at prunplanner, and it doesn't make a ton of sense to add BMPs to the base (it would only save me 25k a day, vs nearly 50k for those 3 extra WPLs. So let's do 9 üôÇ

[09-Jul-24 02:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
How does this sound - the COGM feature on prunplanner isn't working for me right now, so feel free to double-check my math üòÑ 
The total cost to run the base, less the costs of the TCL and PG is like 14.7k per day. So assuming the inputs are free, it costs me roughly 816 AIC per KV (at 18.06 per day)

[09-Jul-24 02:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
So if you provide me the TCL and PG for free, I'll sell the KV back to you at 816AIC /u plus some number for machine time?


[09-Jul-24 02:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
and we can do that for however long your mountain of PG and TCL lasts üòÑ


[09-Jul-24 03:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sure, sounds good to me


[09-Jul-24 03:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Need cash for the base setup?


[09-Jul-24 03:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
Nope - I've got plenty of cash, just low on ideas of what to do with it üòÑ


[09-Jul-24 03:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
so - 50k/day at 18.06 KV / day is 2768.55 AIC / KV. 2768.55+816 = 3584.55/u. So call it 3600/u for the KV?


[09-Jul-24 03:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
if that sounds like too much of a pain to keep track of, let me know and we can figure something else out üòÑ


[09-Jul-24 04:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nope that sounds good (sorry got distracted at work)


[09-Jul-24 04:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'll go pick up the TCL and begin getting it towards Heph


[09-Jul-24 10:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ship with the base is headed towards Heph now! Plenty of space in the WAR there, so just let me know whenever you've got enough PG / TCL in place and I can make it appear. 2 STO, too, so we should be able to stock it up for ages

Woo awesome. I have a base there so anytime is fine


[16-Jul-24 10:41 AM] katinga#0000
I am willing to help sponsor 1 or 2 players who'd be interested in setting up a base on Romulus or Rom C.  I'm running 14 EXT/2 STO base on C and Romulus.  For an idea on H harvesting, I'm running 22 COL/2 STO on Ant 2G


[29-Jul-24 07:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am interested, do you have a prunplan for the base?


[29-Jul-24 07:17 PM] katinga#0000
Unfortunately, I can't use Prunplanner.  it hates me for some reason


[29-Jul-24 07:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
if am going to send you a share link, you wouldn't be able to see?


[29-Jul-24 07:19 PM] katinga#0000
probably not


[29-Jul-24 07:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
so, I though a rough plan


[29-Jul-24 07:23 PM] marat_sh#0000
600 pioneers / 5 EXT / 6 COL - AMM 129/d, H 229/d. 28.3 ROI


[29-Jul-24 07:23 PM] marat_sh#0000
I don't know how much employment is available on Romulus


[29-Jul-24 07:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
pretty expensive considering it's just 11 buildings


[29-Jul-24 07:26 PM] marat_sh#0000
1.08 Mil

number in () if you try to build in that base, I don't have a base there so I can't see


[29-Jul-24 07:34 PM] katinga#0000
should be more


[29-Jul-24 07:34 PM] katinga#0000
don't new bases default with 200?


[29-Jul-24 07:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
300 I think


[29-Jul-24 07:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
200 or 300 one of


[29-Jul-24 07:35 PM] tuffyless#0000
200


[29-Jul-24 07:36 PM] tuffyless#0000
Could put down 362 PIO's on that and 200 of them would be given.  I think until next POPR? not sure


[29-Jul-24 07:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
Still pretty expensive base


[29-Jul-24 07:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
with 50% area used

[29-Jul-24 07:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd say fill it up, it is a lot of shipping but you can make shipping contracts that someone here can pick up


[29-Jul-24 07:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
I was thinking since I will 100% not be able to ship any of it, Katinga can just take it from LM


[29-Jul-24 07:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
I was today years old when I've find out that you can only have 3 permits per base


[29-Jul-24 07:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
at least not until I upgrade my ships

You might want to consider either just hydrogen or AMM on Romulus.  Since I have a REF base on Remus, I'd buy the H from you.  I harvest AMM on Romulus

[30-Jul-24 07:17 AM] katinga#0000

[30-Jul-24 09:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
at what price you want to pick up H? so I can adjust settings


[30-Jul-24 02:42 PM] katinga#0000
You're only using half the parcel for the base?  Why?


[30-Jul-24 02:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
Employment. we can go all in but they wouldn‚Äôt be filled until next pop report


[30-Jul-24 02:44 PM] katinga#0000
If I am doing my math right with 21% of the PIO unemployed, there's over 2k PIO available to fill that base


[30-Jul-24 02:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
I thought workforce is 10% of population, so 21% of 1159 PIO


[30-Jul-24 02:46 PM] katinga#0000
the pop is 11,590


[30-Jul-24 02:48 PM] katinga#0000
That POPR just came out overnight.  so it's fresh.  @archielvahr am I doing the math right?  over 2k of the PIO pop is unemployed?


[30-Jul-24 02:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
3k


[30-Jul-24 02:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
21.6% * (11590-1039) + 1039


[30-Jul-24 02:50 PM] katinga#0000
isn't that change included in the 11590?


[30-Jul-24 02:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
negative


[30-Jul-24 02:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
the % is based on before the addition of new pop


[30-Jul-24 02:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
So unemployment % is from population as a whole and not workforce unemployment


[30-Jul-24 02:51 PM] katinga#0000
migration is 1181


[30-Jul-24 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
so it goes like this - game takes population of 10551 from last POPR, fulfills any open slots**, and then calculates unemployment, and says 21.6%


[30-Jul-24 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
it then adds in the new people, 1181, and then educates a fixed % to the next tier based on education levels


[30-Jul-24 02:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
that education subtracted 142


[30-Jul-24 02:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
you then get the new total change, 1039, and the new total pop, 11590


[30-Jul-24 02:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
so your total available pop is 21.6% * 10551 + 1039


[30-Jul-24 02:54 PM] katinga#0000
I take the break down literally.  PIO is PIO.  Settlers have their own numbers.  that's the way the POPR is represented


[30-Jul-24 02:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh yeah, they do


[30-Jul-24 02:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
everything is per column


[30-Jul-24 02:54 PM] katinga#0000
right


[30-Jul-24 02:55 PM] katinga#0000
but there should be enough PIO to fill Jean's COL base


[30-Jul-24 02:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
easily


[30-Jul-24 02:56 PM] katinga#0000
at 100% of the permit


[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah if you can get the capital, you should almost always be making 500 area bases.


[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] katinga#0000
on Ant2G, I'm running a H COL base with 22 COL, 1100 PIO on 1 permit


[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000

[30-Jul-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000

I don't think I can store that much H at once.  I can buy your H at 85 a unit and pick it up myself.  You wouldn't have to move it.  some others might be interested in your H harvesting.  I know Neth is on Romulus.

A gas hauler ship might be a good project.  I can help fund it.  H is light, but it takes up space.  i'm guessing like... gas cannisters or something.  need the reverse of the WCB

10 BMPs on Heph and 3 BMPs on Phobos

and since I don't have my own capital yet I can do what ever you guys need until I can get on my feet.


[30-Jul-24 03:24 PM] marat_sh#0000
upgrading one ship to gas hauler would help that idea of scraping phobos So i don't need to have 2 ships in one system


[30-Jul-24 03:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
You can look into loans id say

Once you know what you are doing, you can go full speed


[30-Jul-24 03:31 PM] katinga#0000
So with ships, I've noticed that ships take more of a beating in system at STL speeds than in FTL.  It's even worse since they redid the hull plate damage calculation a few weeks ago.  somewhere, Archiel has a magical 2k/2k ship kit, with some assembly required at Heph.  That'd be worth looking into.  I think it's on the UFO Discord?  HQ Upgrades for a lvl 1 HQ are easy to sponsor, too, if you need


[30-Jul-24 03:33 PM] marat_sh#0000

There are some players on UFO that give out grants.  plus some capital folks here.  I try to start a base with about a month's worth of consumables

okay yep, cool


[30-Jul-24 03:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
but to be honest if I am gonna go a loan route, I would rather invest into a Nike PP2 base


[30-Jul-24 04:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
The internal ship price is more like 4.6m but you gotta assemble them piecewise from the corp and supplies are somewhat constrained at the moment probably.


[30-Jul-24 04:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am a very little guy üòá I should probably wait before taking big projects üòÖ


[30-Jul-24 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can cover the base cost of the H base with whatever repayment situation you want to do. 0 interest loan or something more casual on a spreadsheet. I am interested in small amounts of H and AMM but I'm not sure if I want to manage the logistics and sales of the whole amount


[30-Jul-24 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
800 m3 a day when I don't have a base on the planet would be tricky, heh


[30-Jul-24 04:24 PM] katinga#0000
I do have plans to upgrade the warehouse level on Rom.  I just haven't gotten around to it yet.


[01-Aug-24 06:07 AM] melon164#0000
I could really do with someone to make me a pile of CF; like a couple of thousand.  Would be a good opportunity for a new player, fairly simple metallurgy.


[01-Aug-24 06:13 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I migth be interested


[01-Aug-24 06:13 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Like what‚Äôs your target production / week?


[01-Aug-24 06:14 AM] melon164#0000
"lots" üòù


[01-Aug-24 06:15 AM] melon164#0000
at least 15/d


[01-Aug-24 06:15 AM] melon164#0000
But I would use more, and could make do with less


[01-Aug-24 06:15 AM] melon164#0000
So it more depends on what would be a convenient target for the supplier


[01-Aug-24 06:19 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Let me look into things, I‚Äôll get back to you with a proposal

[01-Aug-24 06:49 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I can make you up to 30/day on Vulcan with my existing production


[01-Aug-24 07:19 AM] melon164#0000
I'll take it all!  üòÅ  what price?


[01-Aug-24 07:24 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
What did you have in mind? Its hard to say with how little is being traded


[01-Aug-24 07:26 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
For it to be worth it to change my production, id need 5750


[01-Aug-24 07:49 AM] melon164#0000
I was hoping for a bit lower than that, but we could do that for a month?


[01-Aug-24 07:55 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
what did you have in mind?


[01-Aug-24 07:58 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
As a comparison at 5k/u my base would make around 40k/day which is very low


[01-Aug-24 08:01 AM] melon164#0000
Would it make a material difference if I gave you the SIO?  I have several kilotons of it....


[01-Aug-24 08:07 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Not really, the main cost is the AL that goes in it


[01-Aug-24 08:07 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Well let me see


[01-Aug-24 08:08 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Actually my plans use SI, not SIO


[01-Aug-24 08:10 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Looking at it there is no way it makes sense for me to sell it below 5750.
Maybe a newer player would be more interested, I can let other people see if it‚Äôs something they wanna get into


[01-Aug-24 08:11 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
With me making the SI, profits go down to 33k/day. 40k with free SIO


[20-Aug-24 06:45 PM] archielvahr#0000

Nope üôÇ


[20-Aug-24 07:24 PM] sidepipe#0000

[25-Aug-24 01:55 AM] exeler#0000
I used to make DEC before I started using the PG and EPO myself for OFF. Is there a non-griffonstone chemistry planet near ANT that'd make a good spot for one?

I have a bunch of open and permits and just haven't planned any bases in a while.


[25-Aug-24 06:35 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I do Chem at Elon and Agamemnon.
There is also electronica buts it‚Äôs a bit far


[25-Aug-24 06:51 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm on Griffonstone, Agamemnon, later today Elon, and probably next week Electronica.

[25-Aug-24 06:53 AM] akyantor#0000
Electronica is quite far away, but cheap as it has no special build requirements. If you're doing something that doesn't require a lot of transport, can be a good option.


[25-Aug-24 06:54 AM] akyantor#0000
Elon is probably the second best, only requires SEA. Agamemnon is relatively expensive requiring INS and HSE.


[25-Aug-24 07:19 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Lack of Chem is the main reason is setup as secondary hub in Mor

ZV-639d is a slightly special case because its a gas giant.  Very strongly oriented to NS production.


[25-Aug-24 02:18 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I do NS on ZV-639d and all other chemistry on Agamemnon


[25-Aug-24 03:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's true 639d is amazing tap for N, still chemistry though if you want

What is base sponsorship?


[26-Aug-24 01:38 AM] exeler#0000
When you get later in the game, upgrading your HQ to get new base permits becomes VERY expensive. So this channel is a place where we coordinate helping newer places build bases for things we can't afford (or don't want to spend) a permit on. 

Often times this is for resource extraction or mass production of widely used goods. Those bases tend to be cheap to build, so the cost for later HQ levels far outweighs the base cost. Easier to hand a new player 400k for the base than it is to spend 40 mil on the HQ upgrade just to put down a 400k base that makes 40k per day.


[26-Aug-24 06:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am looking to sponsor this base:
https://prunplanner.org/shared/8d2e4198-bea0-4267-a398-2b75725948eb

I will pay for all mats and consumables. I will regularly give you LIO from my base on the planet and extra HAL. 

I will pay you 200k / week for the permit. You never need to send a ship to the planet. I will take the LI produced back from you on the planet each week for the 200k. Probably can be good to go tomorrow or the next day if you want

Anyone want to build an SIO+SI base?


[12-Oct-24 10:02 AM] hernanduer#0000
Maybe on Hyalos? I'll fund the whole thing, all you have to do is give me enough SI to reimburse me


[12-Oct-24 12:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
How much do you need? I‚Äôm already making some SIO + SI there, plus some FS, but I‚Äôm not using  the whole base atm


[12-Oct-24 12:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
I use at least 40/d


[12-Oct-24 12:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
rather I have a gap of 40/d


[12-Oct-24 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
Let me take a look when I‚Äôm back at my PC - I think I could easily get 40/d extra


[12-Oct-24 01:16 PM] melon164#0000
I just built half a base there for TAI, could easily add anything you need


[13-Oct-24 11:42 AM] sidepipe#0000
Looks like I can add 2 EXT and 4 SME and that should cover your SI needs üôÇ


[13-Oct-24 11:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
will be heading out there in a few days, so just let me know by then if that works for you

I would sponsor an EPO base for sure though

You can send 2k ship and it's good for 30d.  Then you bring home 20k EPO


[08-Dec-24 01:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
Do folks tend to build more of these sorts of self-sufficient bases as they expand?


[08-Dec-24 01:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I seem to do the opposite, when permits are super expensive, I tend to min-max production even harder to compensate üò¨


[08-Dec-24 01:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
my EXT-only LIO base I had to drop because it was like 1300t a day, and that was just too many clicks. I had the spare shipping capacity, but not the click capacity

Yeah, I‚Äôve been running into click capacity issues too. Though the holidays haven‚Äôt helped üòÑ

I guess you all good now. I haven't check Discord for while. : P


[05-Jan-25 02:05 AM] cptboby#0000
can do another


[05-Jan-25 02:07 AM] martin1194#0000
Your main products are?


[05-Jan-25 02:08 AM] cptboby#0000
unsure how that is relevant


[05-Jan-25 02:09 AM] martin1194#0000
I wanna to think a base is good for both/all.  ü§£


[05-Jan-25 02:09 AM] cptboby#0000
none of the leased bases are integrated to whatever i am making


[05-Jan-25 02:10 AM] cptboby#0000
for now making cash is good for me.


[05-Jan-25 03:16 AM] melon164#0000
Would you be interested in this on KI-401b, taking free C, O and PIO consumables and selling me TI at some fixed rate?

Hello people!

I‚Äôve been inactive for some time and would like to know if anyone has any needs in their production chain.
All of my 9 permits are bases in full disrepair and I have yet to settle in a new tree for myself.


[26-Apr-25 04:42 PM] swatacular#0000
It‚Äôs a lot of work to manage that many bases so I‚Äôm hoping I can integrate into someone else‚Äôs production for some easy cash maker


[26-Apr-25 04:43 PM] swatacular#0000
So shoot me your offers such as.

- EPO base on Griffonstone: not sponsored but I‚Äôll buy epo from you.
Or
- FE base on demios: fully sponsored with 30 day repayment plan.
Etc etc


[26-Apr-25 04:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
If you wanna start over to build up wealth look into DW and RAT


[26-Apr-25 04:45 PM] swatacular#0000
I was considering that. RAT is up up up


[26-Apr-25 04:45 PM] swatacular#0000
Maybe i should bid on that

Bobzor does an EPO base with me on Agamemnon. I am still short on EPO, so I could do another one of those, if you're interested. I supply all workforce consumables, inputs, buildings, and repairs. I try to do about 40d of mats at a time, then send me the EPO once a week for 200k, it's pretty low effort for everyone


[26-Apr-25 04:46 PM] swatacular#0000
This one?


[26-Apr-25 04:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, was just talking bases with @weltkriegdrei  and RIGs for H2O + DW was looking really great.

[26-Apr-25 04:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep that's the base


[26-Apr-25 04:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
If you short on epo from time to time let me know

@archielvahr waddya use the Epo for?? and where?


[26-Apr-25 04:57 PM] swatacular#0000
where for this?


[26-Apr-25 05:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahhh I think it might have been in DMs


[26-Apr-25 05:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I use the EPO for either NR (for afabs).. or I use them for the rfabs (which turn into Afabs also) üòÑ


[26-Apr-25 05:03 PM] swatacular#0000
thats what i thought.. do you move the epo to a construction planet then?


[26-Apr-25 05:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, EPO is super easy to ship


[26-Apr-25 05:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
My construction happens on Nike (corp HQ gives a bonus there), and my NR labs are on Nyx


[26-Apr-25 05:18 PM] swatacular#0000
That works then. I like EPO. This would be my third EPO base that I expect to use permits for.
One for myself, one for my old corp out at Circe


[26-Apr-25 05:19 PM] swatacular#0000
What‚Äôs a permit cost these days? About 200k a week?


[26-Apr-25 05:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
You mean like avg profit?


[26-Apr-25 06:47 PM] swatacular#0000
Like what are normal arrangements for base sponsoring


[26-Apr-25 08:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
It depends a lot on the arrangement. I have a few at 200k/week with everything included. Other people pay higher rates but require that person source the workforce consumables and do shipping. A lot of people peg it to the quantity delivered, but I don't care to do that much careful accounting. Especially ones where you are responsible for th e base, if you get behind the sponsor won't want to pay. If I get forget to ship something i don't decrease the rate


[26-Apr-25 08:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am pretty casual about the setup


[26-Apr-25 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Other people run it like a co-op where you get some of the output product and have to sell it, that's how the AA projects run, as far as I can tell


[26-Apr-25 08:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
I run one base with someone where I supply all inputs and materials and they get a 25% cut of whatever the base makes


[26-Apr-25 09:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The AA coops are hard in that regard in my opinion


[26-Apr-25 09:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôve had to wait for my share of the payouts and that has taken a month or so to get to me


[30-Apr-25 01:55 AM] allocater#0000
Does anyone want to build a FP base on Ironforge? Mainly because I need someone to vote for Food COGC üòÑ


[30-Apr-25 04:46 AM] cptboby#0000
Yes, can you send specifics?


[30-Apr-25 08:01 AM] martin1194#0000
Ironforge in which system?


[30-Apr-25 09:31 AM] allocater#0000
It's the neighbor planet of Malahat.

PLI RC-040c


[30-Apr-25 09:32 AM] allocater#0000
I would send everyone who is interested 1mil to build it. Self-supply or you can request materials from me, since I already opeate an FP base there and can just share the inputs.


[30-Apr-25 09:33 AM] swatacular#0000
What‚Äôs an FP base look like?


[30-Apr-25 09:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
Probably like this :

How much is that daily roughly? Is that like 150k?


[30-Apr-25 11:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
105k rn I think


[30-Apr-25 11:03 AM] swatacular#0000
Its worth it I guess. Especially if im gonna be using malahat again


[30-Apr-25 11:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
profit will vary based on planet conditions


[30-Apr-25 11:06 AM] swatacular#0000
oh different planet


[30-Apr-25 11:06 AM] swatacular#0000
yeah RC-040 doesnt have water on it


[30-Apr-25 11:08 AM] swatacular#0000
@allocater I'm suprised you want food instead of something like FEO production.. its literally called IronForge


[30-Apr-25 11:10 AM] allocater#0000
Yeah, it used to be smelters put got abandonend, so I am repurposing it.


[30-Apr-25 11:10 AM] allocater#0000
to produce FIM and MEA for Malahat


[30-Apr-25 11:14 AM] swatacular#0000
why cant you vote? or do you need multiple votes?


[30-Apr-25 11:14 AM] swatacular#0000
just curious


[30-Apr-25 11:14 AM] swatacular#0000
I am interested


[30-Apr-25 11:15 AM] swatacular#0000
especially since ill be continuing to produce at Malahat


[30-Apr-25 11:15 AM] swatacular#0000
