**Fuurin**:	welcome astrid


[28-Sep-21 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	LOL....another one?  This planet is starting to pick up an odor worse than the AMM + N mixture I expect on UV-351d :)


[28-Sep-21 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Honestly, love all the FOWL+KAWA goodness though!


[28-Sep-21 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	Petition to rename planet to Fowlwa or something along the lines


[28-Sep-21 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	do it devs


[28-Sep-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	How about "Chicken of the Sea" as a planet name...??


[28-Sep-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	:D


[28-Sep-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	its still funny how everyone picked it up and starts expanding here


[28-Sep-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	well, its a great planet. So wouldnt like to expand here?


[28-Sep-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	Also our bottleneck, from small to big players


[28-Sep-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	So placing our babies on a soon to be stable (hopefully) planet, that our corp also cares about sounds pretty good


[28-Sep-21 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WaltHeisenberg**:	btw this is also my first base


[28-Sep-21 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WaltHeisenberg**:	but i have been here from the start


[28-Sep-21 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WaltHeisenberg**:	and dont like that a ADM was built


[28-Sep-21 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	well, a growing planet requires POPI to keep the Population and that infrastructure requires Upkeep. So why letting the Taxes we had to pay anyways dissolve and not collect it to pay for that upkeep?


[29-Sep-21 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joronimo**:	The increase in production from the COGC, FAR outweighs the minimal production fees.


[29-Sep-21 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joronimo**:	Furthermore, due to the ADM, the LM fees are lower.

**CapitanIncognito**:	As is traditional for me, I come to a new place missing one key thing. In this case OVE for my people, I don't suppose anyone has some they could sell me?

[14-Oct-21 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-21 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Oct-21 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	I am planning to upgrade the SST to lvl 2 before the next POPR. Please contact me on Discord if u`d like to sell bfabs. I will offer prices as stated in the GOV google sheet


[21-Oct-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	GOV google sheet ?


[21-Oct-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	I have a google sheet which shows all tax income and expenses I made with the Tax


[21-Oct-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	its pinned in the Kiruna Channel on the UFO Discord


[21-Oct-21 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Great, I will have a luck


[21-Oct-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	look


[21-Oct-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	no pinned message in all 3 kiruna channels


[21-Oct-21 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	posted the Sheet in Kiruna-politics again


[21-Oct-21 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Alcohlol**:	welcome to kiruna!


[24-Oct-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	Thanks. Although I discovered the hard way that I couldn’t get many settlers. Not what I expected from looking at the POPR.


[24-Oct-21 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Should be fine next week


[24-Oct-21 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	Good Morning Everyone, I´ve posted a series of bfab ads on the LM. Those are meant to do the necessary upgrade to our SST. Everybody is invited to accept them. Please make sure u can deliver them before our next POPR in 3d8h


[25-Oct-21 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	To al the new folks here, feel free to join us on our Discord: https://discord.gg/xfSjf9mQ . We use it to discuss planetary project, support each other and arrange hauls to different locations.


[25-Oct-21 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Is that the same as the UFO discord?


[25-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	No its the FOWL Discord. But u can, of course, also contact me on the UFO Discord


[25-Oct-21 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just don't want to end up in too many discords :(


[25-Oct-21 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I already don't pay much attention to just one


[25-Oct-21 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Of course I'm mostly just operating this base as a Chlorine factory


[25-Oct-21 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and apparently I forgot that I need water


[25-Oct-21 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Guess my next resupply run/expansion is happening sooner than I thought


[25-Oct-21 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hopefully we don't run out of settlers


[25-Oct-21 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	We only have a few, but very large bases and a few weeks back massive issues with Safety/Health. So there was a massive backlog for several bases


[25-Oct-21 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Corlis**:	settler problem should be solved with the Population report in thursday dont worry


[26-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	The majority of bfabs ads are taken and delivered. Joro and myself are going to donate the remaining BDEs. Thats allows me to pay a premuim price for the yet missing MCG. I posted 4 ads for them


[27-Oct-21 01:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	posted ads for the COGC Upkeep. Feel free to grab em


[27-Oct-21 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	Multiple citizen of Kiruna recently contacted me, that their storages are full of FE and proposed that we should have a second construction week with the COGC. Please contact me if you have any issue with that


[28-Oct-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	me, because I have a net surplus of FE on metallurgy weeks and a net defecit on construction weeks


[28-Oct-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	but I'm happy to buy some excess if we're just doing one extra construction week


[28-Oct-21 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	I think that shouldnt be an issue, we have lots of excess FE

[09-Nov-21 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I put up a buy for H2O at pretty solid per unit prices in case someone has some


[09-Nov-21 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Otherwise, I might have to arrange to ship some in :(


[09-Nov-21 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I have water on my ship, it will arrive in approx. 20h


[09-Nov-21 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Nov-21 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Thanks


[09-Nov-21 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just did a pickup run for my stuff, looked at all my consumables saw a 10+ day supply then didn't look at the water that goes into NA/CL :(


[09-Nov-21 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Sarantia**:	Hello, I take it that everyone alternates the CoGC bonus each week by unanimous consent?


[23-Nov-21 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	yep that's the plan


[24-Nov-21 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, at least I'll get some token benefit half the time now


[24-Nov-21 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I doubt I could convince people to vote for chemistry


[24-Nov-21 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AngryK1tten**:	My base is mainly the chemical industry, but I don’t want to get involved in a big political fight for it, particularly since I just set up my base here. There’d have to be a big Chemistry constituency.


[24-Nov-21 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, that's why I suspect that's not a fight I would win


[24-Nov-21 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The only one I really benefit from is the Verdant one


[25-Nov-21 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	Why would you do chemical here though?  There are not enough settlers...


[25-Nov-21 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Because HAL is heavy


[25-Nov-21 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At first I was just exporting the CL, but now I make the EPO here


[25-Nov-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Technically not much lighter than the, but it means that my mostly empty ship carries C and H here and I only have to carry the finished product


[25-Nov-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, I have free space and experts here


[25-Nov-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If I just extracted HAL, the base would be half empty


[25-Nov-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and one EXT feeds more than 1 CHP


[25-Nov-21 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so I can use as many chem experts as I can


[25-Nov-21 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean there's not much else I could do with this base


[25-Nov-21 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I set up some GFs to benefit from the metallurgy CoGC

[25-Nov-21 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Reasons: The same, a bottleneck of transport.


[25-Nov-21 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yay, I have all 640 of my settlers now.


[25-Nov-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The techs will take a bit of time though seems someone else also decided to go for them


[25-Nov-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	Yeah it looks like the number of settlers is going up more quickly than I was expecting it to.  Thats good news.


[25-Nov-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think employing them is a huge part of that. The openings helps their happiness


[28-Nov-21 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	And health is important too. Thus we have to upgrade our INF in order to keep the good growth


[28-Nov-21 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	I have donated all the bfabs for an upgrade, we still need MCG and TRU. So if anyone has some spare, feel free to contribute it directly!


[29-Nov-21 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sarantia**:	Are we out of PIO?  My base is short about 60...


[29-Nov-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Michionlion**:	I'm going to be running a nearly empty ship to MOR soon, so if anyone has cargo, feel free to post ads


[13-Dec-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alcohlol**:	I think the FE shouldnt be an issue at all, I can fill one ad for you but I`m not producing itmyself, so my stock is limited :D


[13-Dec-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	Thanks! That at least gets things going


[13-Dec-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	I'm guessing the only real issue will be O; I'm sure there's some local production of FLX.


[13-Dec-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	I'm just hoping someone has a large stock and is willing to part with some for over CX price :)


[13-Dec-21 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Its lower then the Market maker price. I have enough ore left for 1 of your adds...


[13-Dec-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	Ah, I will remake then. You are right!


[13-Dec-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	I did not realize FEO was already at MM


[13-Dec-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You are also a bit lucky. I had that stuff overproduced so some stock to share. But soon I need to refill then


[13-Dec-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	Well, I appreciate it :)

[13-Dec-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Not at the moment. Somehow funny with all that shortage on transport. My ship from Kiruna to MOR was 50% and now I send an empty ship from MOR to Ben.

[27-Dec-21 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Dec-21 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Dec-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Kirunites - I have received transfer of our planetary treasury from Alc prior to his departure.  Ads are up for some of the upkeep needs for the planet - I'll identify those with "E" rating (out of habit from Etherwind) to help spot those.  We'll try to continue to return most of the production fees back to our planetary members through this system.


[28-Dec-21 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I'm open to bids for these consumables going forward if you can offer a price better than 200/SUN, 30/OFF, 30/DW, 42/RAT, 12/MCG, and 4/PE - as that could allow us to lower our production fees (or open up more upkeeps for the more advanced POPI)

[02-Jan-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	I personally don't think the government should be asking for below-market rates for anything, as it penalizes those who choose to "do the right thing" and help the government provision population needs

[08-Feb-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Joronimo**:	Aufricer, this is XH-594b.  XH-594a is a different planet in this system that I just build an LM, COGC, and safety station.  It makes this planet ideal for smelting, and XH-594a ideal for construction b-fabs.


[09-Feb-22 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Ah... did not realize the a...


[09-Feb-22 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Mar-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Mar-22 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	I'll try to get some SOI shipped down from Proxion to fulfill the PAR upkeep further to help reduce the loss of TEC to migration away, that should improve their happiness a bit to reduce that effect on the next POPR.


[31-Mar-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-22 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Buggy POPR's this week - I've heard of some issues on other planets... sadly, I think the answer is we have to wait another week before getting any updates to the growth...


[31-Mar-22 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Pinged molp in PrUn discord to see if there is a formal answer to whether the solution is retroactive or only forward looking.  If retro, not sure how the would determine where to allocate pops to existing bases... we'll see


[31-Mar-22 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	On the good side, all happiness numbers over 50% means we should have seen some positive migration growth in each group


[01-Apr-22 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Apr-22 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For the POPI - I wonder how it can be buggy if they did


[01-Apr-22 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	not change it


[01-Apr-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	Don't know.... but multiple planets had issues with zero growth this past period - my assumption is that the update to reduce the education program effectiveness was somehow able to interact with the overall POPR mechanics...


[01-Apr-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocWatz**:	@Aufricer - got a response from Molp - the POPR will not be retroactively fixed, so we'll have to wait for next week's report to see what growth we can 'recapture'


[01-Apr-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Shokanshi**:	The Kiruna Smelters Union dislikes this idea.


[15-May-22 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Let us smelt in peace.


[15-May-22 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Kiruna is a needed FE/FEO planet to support the nearby Libertas and others, we need that extra efficiency


[15-May-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	The uh.. Idk the Kiruna Chemistry Wizards like the idea haha


[15-May-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Yeah well it's disrupting three planets that require this to be working as there is no other good FEO around Benten.


[15-May-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Maybe we could agree to splitting the COGC every week.


[15-May-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	No.


[15-May-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	And you dont see us getting disruptions too?


[15-May-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	You are building it here.


[15-May-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	This has already been a metal planet


[15-May-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	The entire Universe's supply of BRM will depend on Kiruna. XH-083a is nearby


[15-May-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	If you want to use these fallacious arguements of grandeur involving which planets are better,  I can play that way. But you should respect each industry has customers being effected.


[15-May-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	What? Im pointing out this IS the FEO planet for the Benten region, the nearest place is low temp and high pressure and would cost a fortune in shipping + base construction


[15-May-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Kiruna is needed to get FE to Libertas, which makes the building supplies, and to others in Prox


[15-May-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	There are other chemsitry planets like Umbra and such, this is the only real choice of good FEO in this area


[15-May-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	I get 19 FEO per 11 hours right here and that makes enough to keep 3 smelters running per 1 ext


[15-May-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Well this IS also the planet for BRM and other chemistry industries obviously. You're seeing investment here. I understand you have very high costs investing elsewhere and I hope you can still get a beenfit here. But are you saying HAL here IS not the HAL planet?


[15-May-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Yes


[15-May-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	I dont know the market. I just assumed the investments here would be smart.


[15-May-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Theres gotta be a reason and Im not the guy to argue it. I can argue for BRM and thats it.


[15-May-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	There is an entire chain of production across multiple planets that would be disrupted if we suddenly produced less or had to move further out.


[15-May-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	I'm sorry you're going through this. It is my upmost respnsibility to treat you fairly. My vote could change to metal if you can help me fairly as well.


[15-May-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**5h4d0w**:	The FEO here is far more useful for a Staple industry as It's closer to the industrial expansion occuring in the BENTEN area


[15-May-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Do you know the other side of it? Why HAL is being invested in here heavuly?


[15-May-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	I've listened and heard your side, but I'm wondering why HAL is here.


[15-May-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	HAL being mineable isn't reason to flip an entire industry on its end just to support a new one from its ashes. FEO in general has a much higher use for a lot of industry applications and early-to-mid game uses which a lot of player use


[15-May-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	While HAL and its BRM is primarily mid-to-late game stuff that isn't in such a high enough demand to remove the metallurgic industry


[15-May-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Possibly its just the population for HAL producers.


[15-May-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	You should win the COGC then. You'll just need to invest more I guess. And it looks like you'd be able to do so at more favorable rates than us.


[15-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Because you'd get higher returns maybe? Anyway. If no negotiation is being presented, like 1 week of the month for chemistry, then my vote will stay chemistry. Because I do have to protect my own interests. Thank you for chatting with me. It was a pleasure and I wish you future success on our Kiruna Planet family


[15-May-22 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	You guys have a huge lead anyway lol


[15-May-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	I just looked up FEO on the map. Theres Iron ore everywhere


[15-May-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	It is the closest to Benten that is good, Gibson has only as 12% concentration and is used in Construction.


[15-May-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	While Kiruna is our best and closest other than that and its 37%


[15-May-22 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	The industries here need it for stability and high FEO output


[15-May-22 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	MOR doesn't transport over large quantities?


[15-May-22 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	MOR has Vallis


[15-May-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	I see your future returns shrinking as ships become more available. You'll see large imports from Vallis or MOR region coming over to BEN.


[15-May-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	You guys also have Circe for HAL


[15-May-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Equally good point.


[15-May-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Okay, nobody would be willing to pay the 6k something fuel costs + ship costs to import FE/FEO from MOR when we have this which is a better concentration than Vallis


[15-May-22 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Also it would be transfering between two economic currency zones


[15-May-22 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Much easier for BEN to have us trade with them in our own currency and produce more than Vallis and closer


[15-May-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	With standard vessels as well, we can only hold 63 FE per container ship.


[15-May-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**5h4d0w**:	True and the XH hex is basically in Ben space anyways


[15-May-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	thats why we use Libertas as a construction hub since STL is waaaaaaaay cheaper


[15-May-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**5h4d0w**:	^


[15-May-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	We have STL ships flying back and forth


[15-May-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**5h4d0w**:	+ cortez has fuel refineries


[15-May-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**5h4d0w**:	So we've got the Iron for Bfabs the proximity to proxion for LST and then the shipping infrastructure for STL ships


[15-May-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	We have an entire chain set up to support this system without bankrupting everyone


[15-May-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**5h4d0w**:	Kiruna is just a basket of bfab goodness


[15-May-22 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh wow so the discussion was here on the Chemistry CoGC vs Metallurgy


[15-May-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I personally have been voting for Metallurgy, although much of the reason is because Kiruna is the closest FEO-bearing planet to the Benten space, and does so at quite decent values


[15-May-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Additionally, there's a Construction CoGC planet within the same system as Kiruna (Libertas), which would benefit as well from Metallurgy


[15-May-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	On the other hand, Umbra in the Benten space already has a Chemistry CoGC


[15-May-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Umbra still is a good ways away from having Ghost plots, so I think it's still a very viable option as a Chemistry base in BEN area, whereas Kiruna is basically the only Metallurgy eligible planet in proximity that is MCG-only


[15-May-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	HAL is very attractive on Kiruna so I don't blame people for wanting to go Chemistry there, although since there's alternatives for a Chemistry CoGC in BEN (Umbra) but not for Metallurgy in BEN, I probably would vote Metallurgy on Kiruna lol


[15-May-22 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Also HAL is less heavy than FEO, if we were to ship the FEO to a different planet with Metallurgy it would be more expensive to do than HAL for Chemistry


[15-May-22 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	In the end I'll roll with what the majority decides, just wanted to add my cent on why I personally have been voting for Metallurgy :B


[15-May-22 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	You're unwilling to negotiate. Fine.


[15-May-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	All I wanted was 1 week a month for chemistry.


[15-May-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	But you dont seem to care


[15-May-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	:*(


[15-May-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This whole system's CoGCs are off


[15-May-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Cortez should be metallurgy for the gold


[15-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	EPO is infinitely harder to source than bfabs or whatever it is you guys do with FE


[15-May-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Heck, you can even keep the other planet construction and make rfabs


[15-May-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	assuming you get the workers for it


[15-May-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I prefer chemistry. However I settled here knowing it was a Metallurgy CoGC and set up my production lines accordingly. It would be good for me of course if it switches to Chemistry, but it's not a big deal if it doesn't.


[15-May-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The chem bonus is better because it boosts not just the HAL -> CL but also CL -> useful things


[15-May-22 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	sure - but I completely understand those who don't care about HAL and are here for FE metallurgy. There are more of them now. That may change in time as the need for higher-tier products increases.


[15-May-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Yes. Great reasoning there Xk.


[15-May-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	And I will keep advocating for the switch. I have bases in MOR, and I don't find it worthwhile to make bfabs


[15-May-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I can't imagine shipping LST in from out of system to make them


[15-May-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Especially when you have Gibson with FEO, everything you need to turn it into FE and a construction CoGC


[15-May-22 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	because Gibson only produces 13 FEO a day per extractor and you need 6 FEO just to smelt a single piece of FE.


[15-May-22 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	While on Kiruna its 37 FEO a day per extractor


[15-May-22 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	It would be 1 EXT to 1 SME on Gibson but on Kiruna its 1 EXT to 3 SME


[15-May-22 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	We would have to have brain damage to move our entire industry on that


[15-May-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Oof someone isn't very happy :(


[15-May-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Ya'll should move to Vallis.


[15-May-22 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shokanshi**:	Ya'll should move to Circe.


[15-May-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Ya'll should move to Vallis.


[15-May-22 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I also extract HAL on Circe


[15-May-22 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but Circe also takes more room for the LABs


[15-May-22 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	CL if life


[15-May-22 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Damn I was hoping for a childish back and forth @Shokanshi lol


[15-May-22 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've even started a third HAL colony on a cold world, but that one will take a long time to get the pops needed


[16-May-22 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Why not set up on Umbra instead for the existing Chemistry CoGC bonus? There's also H there, which is used in a good number of Chemistry-related recipes.


[16-May-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Also I think Cortez being Metallurgy would be somewhat odd since it's cheaper to ship gold in its Ore form than in its Elemental form


[16-May-22 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	AU is 19.32t per unit, while AUO is 3.86t per unit; The conversion at an SME is 3x AUO -> 2x AU, so that's 11.58 -> 38.64t, it's probably a lot better to smelt it where you're planning to use it


[16-May-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Fuel (from TS > HE3) is also often in high demand (everyone has ships), whereas gold products tend to be higher end and less in demand


[16-May-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	At the end the current distribution of CoGCs you happen to see just boils down to supply and demand, it happens there is existing demand and desire for those CoGCs in those regions


[16-May-22 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Even if you may disagree (and that's totally fine!), it's also worthwhile to consider the reasons for why existing players elected to vote for those programs, since that indirectly also tells you what people actually need.


[16-May-22 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Beecause there's no HAL on Umbra


[16-May-22 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My H comes from a OT-442h


[16-May-22 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Not going to get H from a rocky planet, that would be silly


[16-May-22 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Gold is cheapest to ship in BGC form, which way basically nothing


[16-May-22 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the metallist studio is also metallurgy


[16-May-22 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	TS -> HE3 is strictly worse than just buying HE3


[16-May-22 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've done the math, and never managed to make it work


[16-May-22 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, Umbra is over by Benten


[16-May-22 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Why would I expand in that space?


[16-May-22 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I have colonies on 5 worlds that have FEO, I don't extract it on any of them


[16-May-22 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	All the fuel refining I've ever done has been on a GG with H. It's so much easier to buy and ship in HE3 than to make HE3 and ship in H


[16-May-22 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think that'd be well and good if the BEN area had a frequent supplier of HE3 like NC space does


[16-May-22 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And what i meant by settling on Umbra is that you can ship HAL to Umbra from Kiruna


[16-May-22 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It is relatively light compared to asking people to ship FEO off Kiruna so you can fit more per ship // more fuel and time effective


[16-May-22 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I understand you come from Moria space so you have no shortage of FEO


[16-May-22 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	But in BEN space we actually only have Kiruna as our closest source


[16-May-22 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
***NorseFTX** deleted this message.*


[16-May-22 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	*So we don't quite have that luxury


[16-May-22 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Lol autocorrect doesn't activate on this chat


[16-May-22 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It's a pretty big deal that Kiruna does not require anything aside from MCG in the current development stage of the universe


[16-May-22 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Which is why we've ended up making Kiruna the primary FEO smelting area


[16-May-22 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Although if demand shifts to chemistry substantially, I think that would be fine, and I'll roll with it. Just know that the players as a whole decide the CoGC, not just you or me; I understand why people would want to go for HAL as it is indeed a relatively scarce resource; as it currently stands, most of us ship it off (I ship a chunk of HAL to Proxion and to Umbra). FEO is slightly more troublesome to ship as well as locate in this area; I do hope you will try to understand why people are voting for Metallurgy currently.


[16-May-22 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	Kiruna ->Moria Stasion 444.88t Leaving in 15 min


[16-May-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	@NorseFTX Why would I overextend my logistics like that? HAL is not light and Umbra is nowhere near any of my other bases


[16-May-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This planet is in MOR space


[16-May-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah I'm pretty much saying you're asking many of the people on Kiruna to do the exact same thing, except with FEO, which is heavier than HAL and more units are required per FE unit


[16-May-22 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It may be in MOR space, but it's the closest FEO planet to BEN space, I'm from BEN space as are many of the people who came to Kiruna in search of Iron o:


[16-May-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If you're wondering why not make the full leap and go straight to Montem itself, the reason I hadn't (before the advent of ghost plots) was because Kiruna was both closer and had better FEO yield


[16-May-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	That's just my personal reason though, not sure about others


[16-May-22 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh I just checked, I thought Vallis actually had plots left but it doesn't; both Montem and Vallis are full rip


[16-May-22 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Look at me though, making anti-foreigner and anti-poor (low tier industry) arguments for cynical selfish reasons


[16-May-22 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Truly I have become a great industrialist


[16-May-22 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You guys are in our space so you can get materials to compete with our primary industry. I demand the faction government do something about it!


[16-May-22 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Er... I suppose I should be bribing someone if there was an actual faction government


[16-May-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	:O


[16-May-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	capitalism, ho


[16-May-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	There's nothing wrong with making selfish arguments in the name of business :B I'd consider it part of the game


[16-May-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	We all have different styles of running a business after all


[16-May-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I have definitely purchased cheap BFabs in the past from Montem space while selling consumables there before joining a corp that had in-corp BFab production


[16-May-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The convenience of not having to make a trek to Moria station is too strong :B


[16-May-22 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Well. Be careful. Your buyers of your FEO might stop needing it.


[16-May-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The fastest way to accelerate inter-space exchange (so that regions can more easily trade with one another, and can truly specialize without having to become semi-self sufficient) is to more quickly expand on transport availability (aka Ships)


[16-May-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Are you sure?


[16-May-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I mostly have in-corp buyers for FE, FEO, and BFabs


[16-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If I have a surplus of BFabs I also give them out of corp


[16-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although these days it's getting hard to find a surplus


[16-May-22 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And yeah, with more ships I actually think it'd be much more viable to have more remote bases, which would make some of the exotic planets that are at the edge of the galaxy a bit more attractive


[16-May-22 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Hubur space for example would be more active if we had more ships, they have some very high value planets in that region but it's tough out there because of how far away it is from everything else


[16-May-22 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Do you think more ships would turn the COGC here?


[16-May-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Hoh, that's a hard one, since the CoGC here (Metallurgy) is satisfying a low tier need, which will always be present


[16-May-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I don't know :B


[16-May-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Since your buildings need repairs, then you'll always need BFabs


[16-May-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	and new players also always need BFabs


[16-May-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Yeah but what if BEN got BFAB imports from MOR.


[16-May-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The other thing is that Libertas is specializing in Construction, so there'll also likely be longterm demand for FE in the Kiruna system


[16-May-22 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The goal on Libertas was to eventually go up to PP4s there last I heard


[16-May-22 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	And yeah if BEN got a decent number of BFab imports from MOR (which can be facilitated via more ships), it'd have to be a lot but it may help change things. It's all supply and demand, really :V


[16-May-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	In most cases it's just more convenient for MOR residents to sell at Moria


[16-May-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	it's just cheaper and less time-consuming when logistics are concerned


[16-May-22 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It might be somewhat hard to convince them to export at quantities that the entire BEN space needs at a price competitive with what we can do ourselves if we do Construction in the XH-594 system


[16-May-22 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	But we're still very much in the early stages of the ship production era so it's hard to say what will happen :B


[16-May-22 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	funtimes may be ahead of us


[16-May-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	The additional price per unit for the shipping would be inferior to the additional profits and potential to sell at a higher price.


[16-May-22 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean if enough people on Libertas got to PP3s, they would need more EPO than they can buy on the market


[16-May-22 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I can't begin to imagine how much I would need if I could run my PP3s with a CoGC


[16-May-22 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	er... I guess I could take my current consumption and add like 15-20%


[16-May-22 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or... just toggle the bonus in pruner lol


[16-May-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	er... Looks like with CoGC bonus I would be unable to keep 4 PP3s running with only one planet making EPO


[16-May-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	unless that planet also had a chem CoGC


[16-May-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and that's with me still making some INS and HSEs


[16-May-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I just cut out the HSEs because LSEs are getting expensive to buy


[16-May-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I've more or less exhausted my lfab stockpile


[16-May-22 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I recently bought INS


[16-May-22 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like some sort of person that doesn't have 4 PP3s


[16-May-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but yeah, rfabs take soooo mcuh EPO


[16-May-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and you'll need CL for DDT


[16-May-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yup, for us in BEN our Chem is on Umbra


[16-May-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the NR and TCL


[16-May-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	So much of the production happens there


[16-May-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	very few solo-fliers are on PP3s, most people who are at PP3s are in a corp with already established suppliers


[16-May-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	which may (?) change in the future


[16-May-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, but shipping HAL there then EPO back to the construction CoGC here


[16-May-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yuuuup, that's what we're doing currently


[16-May-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I built my first ship almost solo


[16-May-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so... uh... I guess I am a corp


[16-May-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Mostly because FEO is also an annoyance to ship


[16-May-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Good stuff o:


[16-May-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean, I did create a corp for myself


[16-May-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The true way


[16-May-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but that's mostly for tax collection


[16-May-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I was initially planning to play solo but a very kind person from FOWL convinced me to join a corp lol


[16-May-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I wanted to see how far I could get solo


[16-May-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I may have a different opinion on Kiruna's fate if I wasn't in a corp that has extremely low BFab prices due to Kiruna lol


[16-May-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and apparently the answer is basically anywhere


[16-May-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Same tbh, but that ship has sailed for me lol


[16-May-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah I definitely believe you can and it probably feels awesome to


[16-May-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	except I think rain already proved that part


[16-May-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It just takes more patience


[16-May-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but he made tons of money trading


[16-May-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I wanted to make things


[16-May-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess the only things I haven't done yet is build a corp HQ


[16-May-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and build the most blinged out ship possible


[16-May-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	lmao


[16-May-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My first ship was somewhat modest


[16-May-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	A corp HQ is worth the investment, that 10% is pretty swanky


[16-May-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Only 1k/1k


[16-May-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but also an HYR, which is surprisingly expensive


[16-May-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh nice you started with an FTL capable ship


[16-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[16-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	go big or go home


[16-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If they hadn't made the pop changes when they did, I might have built an STL one


[16-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or if they had implemented ship upgrades


[16-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or if I started on Promitor


[16-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	ship upgrades/retrofitting would def be nice


[16-May-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that system has soo many useful planets


[16-May-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Promitor is a buff planet, that's why it has the most ghost plots


[16-May-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The Moria system has just 2


[16-May-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	and was closest to being full even before steam release lmao


[16-May-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but Hortus has an H/AMM gas giant


[16-May-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a second tier 1 planet


[16-May-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah H and AMM are both the good stuff lol


[16-May-22 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a high concentration FEO planet


[16-May-22 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a SIO planet


[16-May-22 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	another usable H GG


[16-May-22 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	8 of that system's planets are settled


[16-May-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah I can see STL being totally fine there lmao


[16-May-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Although one looks abandoned


[16-May-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[16-May-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	it's also why I almost never see ICA outside in the other regions


[16-May-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like I said, if I were there, I'd be all over it


[16-May-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	also, a lot of those planets are close in


[16-May-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	they have like a space they exist in that's already so stacked they rarely need to interact outside


[16-May-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a-f are all within 2 units of the center


[16-May-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	There's a lot of overlap between CIS and NCC, and a tiny bit of AIC


[16-May-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	but I very rarely see ICA in my area


[16-May-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although Hortus is pretty far from BEN too lol


[16-May-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	basically their f planet is closer to the star than Vallis, by a little bit


[16-May-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Wow


[16-May-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Meanwhile, I settled YI-280d thinking I would ship in stuff from YI-280j without realizing the latter is actually 2 jumps away


[16-May-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Do most of the people here supply FEO for incorp or market Bfabs?\


[16-May-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	because jumping takes 5-8 hours, but flying across the system takes a week


[16-May-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think the majority has been incorp these days, due to the huge influx of players during steam release


[16-May-22 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I imagine many of our corp producers used to send extras to the CX, but that hasn't happened lately


[16-May-22 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	it may take a bit of time for supply to stabilize, the effects of the player influx are slowly reaching some sort of equilibrium


[16-May-22 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	A lot of old players are also needing bfabs for repairs on their additional bases too


[16-May-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I remember I bought over 100 BSEs for one of them


[16-May-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Man. I wonder how many BFABs/d like the entire BEN region is for incorp bfab market sales


[16-May-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah, combining with all the new players wishing to expand (who'll eventually also require repairs) the bfab demand has spiked a ton


[16-May-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	I'm guessing 400


[16-May-22 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	Bfab market is so huge. I think im gonna  join it. What BFAB/d you think it is


[16-May-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	BSEs are great, until they aren't


[16-May-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	The most popular one is BSE > BBH > BDE >> BTA


[16-May-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	at least in MOR


[16-May-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So the issue with BSEs is that to make BSEs you need LST, and to get LST, you need lots of BSEs


[16-May-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	:B


[16-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so high BSE prices drive high LST prices which drive high BSE prices


[16-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean, high prices of other tier 1 goods drive up bfab prices in general


[16-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	There's a point at which you'll reach surplus but they do feed into each other


[16-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but they don't reinforce eachother in a cycle like that


[16-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	right, and once you get the surplus, LST and BSEs both crash


[16-May-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	because suddenly BSE demand drops once people aren't expanding LST production


[16-May-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and when LST crashes, some people tear down EXTs and sell the BSEs


[16-May-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	LST is also important for MCG too


[16-May-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	which is needed for a lot of the most popular planets people like to settle on currently


[16-May-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	LST hit 34 in MOR a few times and was around 50 before Steam release


[16-May-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah I like watching the curves and looked at the 32-34 LST prices in MOR with great envy lol


[16-May-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I started as an LST extractor


[16-May-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I also made FLX


[16-May-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	back when both were super valuable


[16-May-22 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I think even when you're selling at MM you make a slim profit, depending on where you were extracting it


[16-May-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I don't think the same can be said for LST in BEN (Proxion) though


[16-May-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	so what do you think the total BFAB demand for incorp is a day?


[16-May-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheNegotiator**:	in the BEN region


[16-May-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	That depends a lot on the size of the corp


[16-May-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Hm...


[16-May-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	If you're trying to get a measure of the demand for Bfabs in BEN that you aren't seeing on the CX in general, you can probably just take the number of companies and say the ratio of demand for BSE:BBH:BDE is about 10:2:1 for every company


[16-May-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	it's not a perfect estimate but it's ... "ok"


[16-May-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	You might have some trouble capturing the corp demand though because they mostly trade in-corp


[16-May-22 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(or at least trade on the LM, even if out of corp)


[16-May-22 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It's funny, I look at the CXM for BSE and I see Benten area has the lowest volume lol


[16-May-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I don't think we have the lowest amount of players, but maybe the highest percentage of players that live exclusively on LM deals


[16-May-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I kinda wish we could see stats on that


[16-May-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	It makes sense though


[16-May-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Moria's exchange is very close to its most populated planet(s)


[16-May-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Proxion on the other hand is in a different system from Benten station


[16-May-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	so LM exchanges being more common in Benten because of the requirement for FTL travel to the CX kinda makes sense


[16-May-22 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	(Proxion being the most developed planet in Benten space)


[16-May-22 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Antares is a kinda similar case as Proxion, but Deimos is living that ALO starter planet life so their high BFab availability on the CX makes more sense


[16-May-22 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Oh wait I forgot about Phobos


[16-May-22 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	I'm sorry Antares, I almost never visit you D:


[16-May-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah Phobos is the same system as Antares Station and has FEO, they'd have BFabs on their CX as well and it makes sense to


[16-May-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	although their FE prod is pretty bad on Phobos, I wonder if they're doing it mostly on Deimos anyway


[16-May-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Honestly in Antares, I'd expect their bfabs to be made of AL


[16-May-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Yeah that'd make the most sense lol


[16-May-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	Sometimes I wish products showed the corp that made them and with what mats (if it's a multi-recipe item) but with how the CX handles things and how the DB server already crashes a lot with the current stuff as it is, I understand why not lol

**EyangKodok**:	lol


[18-Jun-22 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paulrik4444**:	I actually think this will be a better planet anyhow, richer in FEO and I use HAL for chlorine production and lithium smelting.

[26-Jun-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean they're not rolling the the EPO.NC1 money


[26-Jun-22 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	That's true. Kiruna EPO is particularly good too! it's super pure and has that nice blueish hue prized by EPO junkies..... er... I mean construction production lines...

**Xk37**:	Maybe some of you don't realize this, but _anyone_ can make contributions to the CoGC maintenance. You don't have to be governor. You only get the +25% benefit if the CoGC is not on strike. Right now it's on strike, so voting for Metallurgy, or anything else, is pointless. I personally have zero interest in Metallurgy, so I won't contribute to the CoGC. But it's baffling to me that so many of you are voting yet none of you, as of right now, have made any contribution to get the program up and running again.

**Xk37**:	Sorry if I'm stating the obvious - just trying to point this out for anyone who may not be aware.

**NorseFTX**:	It was back up and running over 3 days ago (?), you might be referring to the upkeep for next cycle, which is empty and due in 7 days @Xk37


[27-Jun-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NorseFTX**:	the metallurgy buildings I have are all benefiting from the 25% bonus currently


[27-Jun-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	ahhh - so sorry. I didn't read it correctly. Nevermind. (Note to self - never use your own supply of EPO)


[27-Jun-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I didn't see any recent contributions and so I assumed it was still on strike. But right on top it says 'ACTIVE'. My bad.

**Aufricer**:	reminder again: I have a STL ship insystem. I fly it between the 3 planets on a regular base. If you do shipping adds, dont forget Autoprovision (I dont wait). Sometimes consider splitting shippments in two orders will increase the chance for transport (I do have 100t only sometimes and less often "empty" flybacks)

[26-Jan-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**tackle**:	true


[26-Jan-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DocWatz**:	FYI - I'm winding down my PrUn "career".  Until this term is up on the governorship, if anyone fills items for the CoGC or POPI upkeep, just send me a CONTD for your purchase cost in NCC and I'll do my best to check in every so often to pay for those expenses


[30-Jan-23 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Messerjack**:	Then you would be the second GOV to do that in a short period of time in this system... what's up? Liberta's GOV just left last week


[30-Jan-23 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Messerjack**:	I've only been with you since yesterday... COGC isn't a problem, of course... the safety station is still manageable. But I don't have the capacity for the rest

[04-Feb-23 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	@Ravick Election is once a month, amount of time you need to invest to make things happen vary greatly


[05-Feb-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Heavily simplified , finding affordable supply for OFF DW TUB/STR FOD/PFE/SOI/DEC UTS and maybe COF/REA - I do not have a UNI over at Libertas..


[05-Feb-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	That part depends on your contacts so if you do not have to go on a wild hunt like I did it might not end up costing 1,5 mill for the first month to get some safety stock prepped


[05-Feb-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Hauling it all there depends on your trade routes.. and I forgot to list the MCG RAT and PE for COCG but since that's basic base supplies it's just a matter of keeping extra in stock


[05-Feb-23 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Once you find a routine of how much you need to invest in upkeep it's mostly a matter of checking the weekly report to see if upkeep needs adjustment to get the numbers right


[05-Feb-23 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-23 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Messerjack**:	I would be curious about that for sure. But I think the supply exceeds my transport possibilities. If it were just a matter of a few safety stations, that wouldn't be a problem, but Kiruna is already quite well positioned and needs a little more care.

[21-Mar-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Should pull up the user list and see who _isn't_ a gov.


[21-Mar-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EyangKodok**:	yes atleast we can have a Proxy instead if they cant or unwilling taking care POPI (assuming someone else can take care the POPI)


[21-Mar-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	For popi, the upkeep has 3 weeks at current rates of consumption.  Though that's borrowing from the future if not replenished.  The taxes going to the faction coffers void is annoying.


[21-Mar-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	At least Kiruna doesn't seem to need a program running, so it's just POPI and COGC which could be funded by those with bases here - if we can't find a new Gov in the near term

[22-Mar-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	@Cerebrate I don't have any MCG _here_ (I've got a large supply of it on Cortez though).  My ship is currently the way to Kiruna and could pick some up and back in... 9 or 10 hours or so.


[22-Mar-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Thanks XrayD!


[22-Mar-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	(re: Kiruna to Cortez... MS XH-594 --- OUCH for the planetary alignments.  That's a 9h flight at 50 fuel instead of a 4h flight at 40 fuel.


[22-Mar-24 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	@shagie I had busy ships for a few days so I needed a larger supply run than usual. I'm doing some expansion here tho so I'll dm you and see if we can sort a regular shipment out :)


[22-Mar-24 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Its not so much "a regular shipment" but rather "stuff I left at Cortez and haven't built up yet"


[22-Mar-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Myrtenaster**:	fair enough


[22-Mar-24 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Mar-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Novachrono28**:	Hello esteemed Kiruna owners. I have been supplying Kiruna with upkeep at 1/3 of CX price for a while and still been a taking quite the loss. As such ill be adjusting the taxes a little. Thank you for understanding and please raise any concerns you might have.


[16-Jul-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Power to you.  This update showed me just how much money I was losing on planet upkeeps elsewhere


[16-Jul-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	true that. We've been aware of losses for a while, we're kind of hoping that this update make those losses a little more transparent to others. We're not getting rich managing planets, but it's too much work to deserve a loss


[16-Jul-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	I think that running planets is one of the more fun ways for our mostly isolated corp to give back to the universe though. Our lower priced internal marked means we can make a profit and still charge taxes 30% less than the CX cost of upkeep ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ win win


[16-Jul-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Fair enough.  I'm solo, so my planets get the full CX cost - but I'm more than fine being replaced by others if they want to do it cheaper :)


[16-Jul-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	The flip side of internal pricing for COGC and POPI is that it discourages others from contributing (if the planet also does reimbursements).


[16-Jul-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	If you're reimbursing DW at 50% of DW.NC1 cost, it means that you're doing it because I can't afford to.


[16-Jul-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shagie**:	Additionally, it means that the budget and books are harder if someone from a different corporation wants to get involved - since the production fees and costs are based off internal costs.

**Gravy**:	Hopefully the standard will be CX costs (and really at some point a stipend for the efforts).


[16-Jul-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I aim to make it CX costs and taxes to cover it on all planets i am gov on. Some want to donate thing like tub to keep taxes from changing but need upkeep for ENG and SCI LMFAO


[16-Jul-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	to be honest, it's a lot easier to reimburse just one person filling all needs. In case of emergency we will ask for help filling things and reimburse at full CX cost, but otherwise we don't really want to set the expectation of reimbursing anyone who donates anything, that's expensive and so much work. I think that operating at CX cost of upkeep is super fair, there are a lot of players who get upset about the tiniest tax expenses though so the 30% discount is also just us playing the politics part of the update ;3

[02-Aug-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Aug-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah, looks like another 66 ENG were added to the planet too. we should be mostly full next POPR, completely full the one after. It's ENG, so only the programs will really help us, but once the pop is filled again we have the infrastructure to support it now.


[08-Aug-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	welp, 76 ENG gained this week, another 70 needed from a new base xD

I also raised taxes to offset our current deficit as we're taking in around 230k/week. We'll see how the raised taxes reduces deficit before deciding on the next course of action.
