**Azean**:	I will send a ship to Moria in about 8hours, feel free to post shipping contacts should you need to send something there on an overnight trip. The trip should take 10-12 hours.

[02-Nov-21 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-21 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DragonTyrant**:	hello! ship leaving Moria Station to Danakil in 2 hours, 450 t/m3 left. PM if interested


[04-Nov-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taxeedrvr**:	I still am building up my base but maybe in a month I could be able to supply construction material


[04-Nov-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taxeedrvr**:	although by next week i can make some office supplies once i make a shipment to moria


[04-Nov-21 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taxeedrvr**:	Can we put straight into upkeep or do we have to build/upgrade the building first?

[04-Nov-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I'm pretty sure you can just upkeep it


[04-Nov-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Upgrades will make the building more effective, but honestly I'm uncertain


[04-Nov-21 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I believe the building has to exist (i.e. be at least lvl 1) before it starts taking upkeep and working


[04-Nov-21 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	also, health is already at 100% so supplying an infirmary won't do anything - you'd want to start with a safety station


[04-Nov-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Great point. I 100% misread that


[04-Nov-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I'll bring out the items to upgrade the safety station before the next reset

[05-Nov-21 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taxeedrvr**:	but i am going to get going anyway. this is our planet and ive always been working up to getting our infrastructure up and running


[05-Nov-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taxeedrvr**:	maybe eventually get a planetary project running that can help with productivity


[05-Nov-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ryctor**:	What do i need to do to help out Cygl


[11-Nov-21 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ErikSFG22**:	Can Trial/Basic users contribute?


[11-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	yes, you go to the planet page and click "population infrastructure", and then "details" for the SST


[11-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	from there you can contribute consumables, or bfabs for the next upgrade


[11-Nov-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	one thing to note is that we are fine in terms of pioneers; unless you are also planning on employing settlers within the next week or two, any contributions you make there only benefit people on the planet who employ settlers


[11-Nov-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	on a normal planet, this would be taken care of via tax dollars by the governor; however Danakil wasn't an original starting planet and no one has bothered to build an ADM to allow for a government to be set up yet


[11-Nov-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ErikSFG22**:	Ah, I see. I guess there's not really any reason then since I don't have settlers and don't plan to. I'm just sitting on a fair amount of BDE and it seems that the price dropped at Moria recently


[11-Nov-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	you can always use the BDE for your own buildings or hold and hope the price goes up


[11-Nov-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	but yeah, this is a capitalism simulator and while I'm sure Cygal appreciates the generosity, keep in mind that his corp has been around since the universe was created and is probably already extremely rich :)


[11-Nov-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ErikSFG22**:	Yeah, I'll probably just wait. Or I could get a pro licence and sell to one of you guys on the LM


[11-Nov-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	it's not looked down upon at all in this game to just be like "I'm not gonna contribute to that project since it doesn't benefit me"


[11-Nov-21 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	if you're not working together with a group for broader goals, that is


[11-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ErikSFG22**:	Ah, okay. Thanks for the heads up :)


[11-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	richer, more established companies will often help out newer players for no benefit to themselves, there's really no need for the reverse :)


[11-Nov-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Discern is correct. The current infrastructure supports settlers. However, I'm happy to build infrastructure that benefits pioneers


[11-Nov-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I've been around for awhile, so if anyone needs something, feel free to reach out!


[11-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I plan on working towards getting the Global Chamber of Commerce up and running as well


[11-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Wouldn't mind the boost :P


[11-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	And I'll keep an eye on population needs


[11-Nov-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	There are about 90 people on this planet, so at some point it may make sense to build up the planetary admin building as well


[11-Nov-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I've been on this planet a while, luckily the pios haven't seemed to need any help at any point


[11-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	That's fair! Would you all want a WAR set up on the planet?


[11-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I could do that next if you wanted


[11-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	it's shifting, but before this was a starter planet there were like 3 of us here, which makes it a very interesting planet in that most of the residents here are quite a bit newer than the average planet


[11-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I think the reason the pios don't need help is that the average base here isn't full


[11-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	so the health and safety from CMs is enough


[11-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	That's a good point. I actually didn't know it was one of the new starters


[11-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I just came here as it's close to Moria :P


[11-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	yeah it's a nice planet once you're already on montem and vallis haha


[11-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	definitely 3rd fiddle to those two


[11-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	it's my 7th planet :P


[11-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	haha yeah, I'm on 6


[11-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I think the rich players are just starting to settle here now that shipping is getting tougher


[11-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	That last HQ upgrade is terrible on the BFabs...


[11-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	yeah... It's getting rough...


[11-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	saw the termatici folks join recently


[11-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	but a month ago I don't think there were enough rich players on the planet to get a cogc up


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	certainly couldn't do it myself haha


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	we might be at that point now


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	what were you thinking for the program, agriculture?


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	pios?


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	settlers? :P


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I'd avoid ag on this planet


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Pios would serve most people


[11-Nov-21 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I would not complain on settlers


[11-Nov-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	but that's only me. I'm making a TON of PG here


[11-Nov-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I'd probably have to vote against ya there haha


[11-Nov-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I'd vote for Pios


[11-Nov-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I'm not selfish :P


[11-Nov-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	:D


[11-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I'm just trying to make sure I have over 600 Settlers :P


[11-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	fertility is 87% here, it's not a bad farming planet tbh


[11-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	even the least fertile planet is still 70% i think


[11-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	that's fair


[11-Nov-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	anyways, if we can get a crew together and split the cost I'd definitely help out with a cogc


[11-Nov-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	I make LFabs for days. You have access to the electronics stuff? Or should I set up a new planet for that stuff :D


[11-Nov-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	my corp is working towards that but not sure what the timeline would be


[11-Nov-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I think the CX competition has taken up the entire stock of electronics since people are trying to build up those far-out planets


[11-Nov-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	RFabs are fun :P

[23-Nov-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Nov-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Nov-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Nov-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Nov-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Nov-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Cygal**:	Thanks @Dragon!


[30-Nov-21 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DragonTyrant**:	yw :) ill deliver it in 18hrs


[30-Nov-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I've put an order in at corp rates (I think I'm like 4th in line?) to our electronics producer, looks like the total cost will be ballpark 150k. Looks like it'll be ready in maybe a month?


[30-Nov-21 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	any contributions would certainly be welcome, but I'm happy to cover a big chunk of the cost


[30-Nov-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for what, ADM\COGC?


[30-Nov-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	which comes first


[30-Nov-21 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	COGC I believe


[30-Nov-21 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	At least, that's what I'm working on :P


[30-Nov-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	before ADM? *Gasp*


[30-Nov-21 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	*a great display of wealth*


[30-Nov-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	We can work for either


[30-Nov-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Doesn't horribly matter to me


[30-Nov-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	cogc first I think


[30-Nov-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	get the boost sooner


[30-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	To lowstrife's point, if we get the ADM, taxes will help offset the cost of COGC somewhat


[30-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if ya'll are rich enough to front the upfront before collecting taxes


[30-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	go for it


[30-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's appreciated


[30-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	we're working on it :P


[30-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm still undergoing... rapid expansion


[30-Nov-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	that won't stop xD


[30-Nov-21 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I'm fine to go CoGC first


[30-Nov-21 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	maybe we can get some taxes back in the future once we have the ADM


[30-Nov-21 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	fine with ADM as well tho, up to yall


[01-Dec-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I dunno - it's a balance


[01-Dec-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	ADM is better for you guys who are footing the bill


[01-Dec-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	since you can recoop costs earlier


[01-Dec-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	COGC is better for everyone else since it gets built earlier


[01-Dec-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's up to you guys frankly - thanks either way


[01-Dec-21 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	ADM first so open bookkeeping can make sure costs get covered for CoGC


[01-Dec-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	10% buff is nice (I'm assuming we do Pioneers), but nbd


[01-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	A bunch of accounts must have been closed / deleted. There's 5000 unaccounted for Pioneer decline between the last two reports. That's 25 bases.


[06-Jan-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Between the last two weeks there are 6800 unaccountd for lost pioneers, which is 34 bases.


[06-Jan-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	The week before that, there were 41 new bases.


[06-Jan-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	Could be a lot of new players joined, and then became inactive, and were quietly dissappeared.


[06-Jan-22 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I doubt anyone will fill those orders here


[16-Feb-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	@eattacos88 Did you buy up all the COF/OVE/PWO/DW you could find?


[16-Feb-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	I see you buying i up all over the place


[16-Feb-22 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	[side note: what's the 88 at the end of your name for?]


[16-Feb-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydroa**:	[hopefully 1988]


[16-Feb-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EatTacos88**:	haha. Not ALL of it :) I'm trying to take full advantage of my one month of pro. I'm going from HQ lvl 5 to 13 and stocking putting up as many LM ads as I can :). And yes 88 is for 1988 when I was born. And yeah @lowstrife I probably mispriced something. It was a lot of ads all at once :)


[16-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EatTacos88**:	Yeah woops those 500 PWO orders were supposed to be for DW. Thanks for catching that.

[04-Apr-22 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I'm pretty sure pioneers heavily outweighed construction


[05-Apr-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	Some people asi me about vote for construction. I am open for lot of ideas but more people have interest in construction


[05-Apr-22 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	I spend lot of materials to CoGC. Why you asi about construction after vote And not before?

[05-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I also invest heavily into the COGC - I supply the PE every week


[05-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah an ADM would be great so that someone is responsible for getting things done


[05-Apr-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	Hello Danakil! As you may have noticed, In addition to supplying the SST this week, I just popped down an ADM and WAR, and I'd love to humbly throw my hat in the ring for governor. I believe that Danakil, being a single, consistently quick hop from MOR, is in a prime position to capitalize on the significant player growth we have seen in the recent weeks and will hopefully continue to seem with the Steam release. I will strive to make Danakil one of the best places to thrive near the Moria system for new and established players alike. In the short term, I want to stabilize Pioneer / Settler populations, Infrastructure upkeep, and COGC. Long term, I want to explore programs with the Danakil community like subsidized materials for new players on planet and increased planetary infrastructure. I hope my large personal investment into Danakil makes my commitment clear, and I hope to have your support in this endeavor. Please reach out in game or PrUN if you'd like to discuss more


[12-Apr-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	Hey Friends! Given that a much smaller subset of people benefit from Construction rather than Metallurgy I'm going to slightly increase taxes for the construction segment to make things more equitable since they're getting most of the value out of the COGC (20->25 for Pioneers, 40->50 for Settlers). Let me know if there are any objections here!

**Bobemor**:	You should definitely be able to pull the 200 you start with. But there does seem to be a shortage of workers. This will be easily corrected when the POPR (population report) happens in 1.5 days time, but you should have the 200 guaranteed at start


[19-Apr-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	Welcome to Danakil! Yes, like Shadow and Bobemor said, workers will refresh the day after tomorrow and you should be all set then. Keep in mind that you will need to build more housing (HB1s likely) for your workers. Required is how many you need to run your buildings, Capacity is how many you can house, and current is how many you have. The current number will be fixed by the population report coming up, but your capacity is still low

**TheDoctor1786**:	Hello friends! Wonderful population report that just came in - we almost doubled the size of our planet this week! There's huge unemployment of pioneers which is to be expected from our new entreprenuers (welcome, capitalists!), and I'll make sure to keep needs fulfilled so they stick around. There's a small buffer of settlers (roughly 500), and the Family Planning program set for next week should grow that substantially. As always, please let me know if there's any feedback, thoughts, feelings, complaints, etc. Bonne Chance Capitalists!

**shadowsneak**:	Welcome to Danakil, if anyone has questions, dont be afraid to ask. Our nearest trading CX is MOR (NC1) and its one jump over in the OT-580 system.


[21-Apr-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	One of the benefits of being here is the reliably short times (~4-6 hrs) to fly to the CX compared to some planets


[21-Apr-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yes! Not only is it short, it's *consistantly* short (as shadow mentioned), and it uses a mix of FTL Fuel (FF) and STL fuel (SF). This is good because A. FF is cheaper and B. You use a lot less of it. You should still limit your CX runs and conserve fuel, but this should hopefully help you out a bit!


[21-Apr-22 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	And yes would super encourage you to ask questions here - we're much friendlier than global chat

**cellozzo**:	noob question, is possible to trade between players in our market without going to nc1?


[21-Apr-22 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	If you're PRO or Basic, yes! You can use the LM


[21-Apr-22 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	You unfortunately are not, so no :(


[21-Apr-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	the game is promising, we'll see ahaha


[21-Apr-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	If you get pro for one month you go back to basic instead of trial which lets you accept LM ads (not post though)


[21-Apr-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	that's interesting


[21-Apr-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	why hello


[21-Apr-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	I am your local Carbon Farmer


[21-Apr-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	sounds like we are getting an influx of those lately :D


[21-Apr-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	I am sure us Steam joiners are doing it.


[21-Apr-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well theres always need for C on the smoggy bases of Vallis and Montem


[21-Apr-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there might be a handful of smelters here, but its more constructors making bfabs


[21-Apr-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Well I will figure all that out soon.


[21-Apr-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	another good thing to do is make PE with H and C


[21-Apr-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	since H is easy to ship in from MOR


[21-Apr-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	I am bringing in some stuff from MOR right now anyone have anything I could get for them?


[21-Apr-22 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Theres a lot of constructors here that import from vallis and montem, MOR is typically for consumables for several of us


[21-Apr-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Unfortunately you don't have PRO so you can't actually trade outside of the CXs


[21-Apr-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	(So 'bringing people stuff' won't really work)


[21-Apr-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	I will get pro soon. Not sure if this early in the game is worth it for me. I just started.


[21-Apr-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	biggest benefit in the early game is to pickup shipping contracts and make some extra cash easily


[21-Apr-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yep totally makes sense, if you get pro for a single month you go back to Basic rather than trial which lets you accept LM ads which is good to know

**TheDoctor1786**:	Welcome welcome!!


[21-Apr-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Just an FYI, would reccomend making GRN in your FRMs and burning that rather than HCP

***Batmancer** joined.*


[21-Apr-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	There's a lot of nuance in what recipe you're using for your INCs but in the short term GRN will save you water over HCP so I would reccomend starting there while you figure out what's optimal

[21-Apr-22 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Welcome to the local market, we have our own little corner store


[21-Apr-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	YAY!


[21-Apr-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Shipping contracts are hugely helpful as I may have already mentioned once


[21-Apr-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Ok so I am about to land at Moria Station anything good I could bring back to sell?


[21-Apr-22 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	and several of us have stuff coming in from Montem and Vallis, so we’ll try to post them here if you want some easy side cash


[21-Apr-22 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	hm. Everything is really high priced at the CX lately, so most of us are holding out on stockpiles I’d think


[21-Apr-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	ok. Yeah I have to go pick up my grain so I can start making carbon

***AutoBacs_7** joined.*


[21-Apr-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	where the LM shines is when you find a dedicated buyer/seller locally then you don’t have to go to the CX to trade input/outputs


[21-Apr-22 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	like if you pair up with a PE maker who needs C, you both save a trip


[21-Apr-22 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Nice. Yeah I need stuff to make carbon.


[21-Apr-22 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	not too many farmers here on Danakil, but worth asking around


[21-Apr-22 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	I might start a farm next to make it for myself. Weird not many farmers good soil and water


[21-Apr-22 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	The water is kinda meh, but decent for C farming if you’re going to grow an efficient crop like MAI


[21-Apr-22 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Was going for GRN


[21-Apr-22 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	GRN is quicker but takes more water


[21-Apr-22 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Ah ok


[21-Apr-22 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I havnt checked how many RIGs you need to keep a GRN farm going


[21-Apr-22 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	or the ratio of them


[21-Apr-22 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Anyone else having an issue loading the local market


[21-Apr-22 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Apr-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Apr-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	what are you using the PG for? DW?


[22-Apr-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes


[22-Apr-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	nice, it makes the process much more efficient


[22-Apr-22 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I think normally the H2O only recipe is more profitable but not sure if that's true with current prices (and yeah PG to start is definitely a good move)


[22-Apr-22 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes, the cost for the PG is really worthwhile


[22-Apr-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	1 PG for 3 more DW is really good, even with the doubleing the time of production that influence the workforce cost...but i produce DW and RAT myself so that isn't a problem, i only buy OVE atm and i have a contract with a player to exchange it for RAT and DW, so i'm fine, as soon as i can expand i will make good prices for all on DANAKIL

[22-Apr-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	The other benefit is then you dont need as many RIGs when the recipe is slower


[22-Apr-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the non DW recipe burns sooooo fast


[22-Apr-22 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes, but i was thinking about at least 3 rigs, i don't have problem with RAT and i can choose agricoltural product with low water usage but DW with or without PG burn water fast

[26-Apr-22 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**neoshancullman**:	it would be nice but i think the closest is in the moria system


[26-Apr-22 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	well we could form one...maybe some more experienced players here on Danakil


[26-Apr-22 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	actually i don't even know what are the benefits of being in a corp regarding this game


[26-Apr-22 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	CORP Its good for share material buildings and cooperation


[26-Apr-22 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	Its like one player with lot of bases in one place


[26-Apr-22 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

**cellozzo**:	ahahah i'm italian, i know what r you talking about


[26-Apr-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	so, what about establishing a danakil CORP?


[26-Apr-22 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Corps are great! Just keep in mind that the only material benefit of a corp is an HQ that gives you 10% efficiency but it doesn't work on faction planets (like Danakil) so you don't actually need a corp to start cooperating (though you're certainly more than welcome to!)


[26-Apr-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Happy to give advice, just let me know. Right now I'd say Danakil seems to be a good spot for construction with the consistant travel time to MOR and the COGC - import supplies from the CX, build prefabs here, ship them back to the exchange should be pretty lucrative


[26-Apr-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
***joe25nez** left.*


[26-Apr-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	actually i begin with DW and RAT so i don't have to ship them anywhere cause i can sell them on the local market, and i think i can buy some prefab here to so yes it's a good place to start, i made a stupid travel to moria just to buy some pref with a round trip cost of 4000 before learning about the dynamics of shipt travel, now i have a ship always home and one alwyas at moria station and i take 13h for the trip and is very slow but it costs only 1800


[26-Apr-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Honestly 13 hours for super low fuel settings isn't bad at all


[26-Apr-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes, is way more than 3 hours spending 4K, but danakil is just 1 jump from moria so...


[26-Apr-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	And yep you can definitely do DW and RAT - just keep in mind if you're using RIGs for water the water output is a bit low, and the negative fertility means growing takes a bit of time. You're more than welcome to continue (and it will help you be more self-sufficient which is good when you're starting) but you may find later on that it's actually less profitable to do that


[26-Apr-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	also running the PG recipe for H2O can help with the water situation


[26-Apr-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that way you dont burn the extra water unecessarily


[26-Apr-22 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yeah i'm learing about the low water output now but i don't think i'm going to start over for that. actually i installed 3 rigs but as you say i'll have 3 rigs to repair and it will cost me...i'm using the PG from the start that i buy here on the local market and it's profitable as well, even if i didn't produce it myself


[26-Apr-22 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	theres usually some extra PG here since people use it to make fabs


[26-Apr-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	where do i see the infomations about fertility of a planet


[26-Apr-22 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	?


[26-Apr-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	on the planet info


[26-Apr-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it has a very non-descript bar


[26-Apr-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if it is left of the midline, the planet has a negative bonus to fertility


[26-Apr-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Danakil is -10.8%


[26-Apr-22 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch


[26-Apr-22 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	This will give you the detail that Shadow is referencing


[26-Apr-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Shadow where'd you get -10.8? I'm seeing -13.51% on FIO


[26-Apr-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Cellozo this wil also show you daily extraction amounts of resources (like H2O!)


[26-Apr-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	rains sheet has it as -10.8, but that might be wrong


[26-Apr-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Are you using the latest version of Rain's sheet? That's super strange


[26-Apr-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	That's like a 25% difference


[26-Apr-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	-13.3%, I had the wrong planet in -_-


[26-Apr-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	silly me


[26-Apr-22 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Phew you scared me


[26-Apr-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	well, i should have choosen another planet for DW and RAT ok ahahah


[26-Apr-22 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	i was thinking about something, i could reset and begin anew in a new fertile planet, but wait, probably that planet is full of DW and RAT producer so it will difficult to sell on the local market and i will be obliged to transport products on the general market


[26-Apr-22 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Verdant and Promitor are the popular ones for that


[26-Apr-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that is the tradeoff, yes


[26-Apr-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	in this case probably i'm the only producing DW and RAT on my local market


[26-Apr-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that is also likely the case


[26-Apr-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	any RAT and DW you sell here will very likely get bought at a reasonable price


[26-Apr-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	ok so i'll se how it turns in this case and i keep my base here


[26-Apr-22 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there are also planetary upkeep contracts, and the govenor will need to fill those with RAT and DW


[26-Apr-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yes hi hello that's me I'm happy to buy RAT / DW from ya to fill COGC upkeep


[26-Apr-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	thx governor :)


[26-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	someone need fuel? i put some of mine on the local market


[26-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	No but I"m happy to buy it off you if you need the money lol


[26-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	right? lol


[26-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Just shoot me a DM if you see that you have the materials needed to fill any of the upkeep buckets


[26-Apr-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	where do i find the upkeep buckets?


[26-Apr-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Chamber of Global Commerce


[26-Apr-22 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	DW, MCG, and RAT are the ones I'll be getting regularly


[26-Apr-22 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	cool, there's enough demand for keeping my settlers occupied for ages


[26-Apr-22 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	i'd like to understand better this upkeep thing, where i can find some informations? obviously is too early for me for manage a planet but i'd like to better understand the deepness of the game


[26-Apr-22 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	clicking through the Population infrastructure buildings on a planet like Vallis or Circe is a good way to learn


[26-Apr-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	use PLI command to pull up planet search, then type Circe


[26-Apr-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	they have a lot of infrastructure there


[26-Apr-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	ok, interesting, so based on the structure and lvl built on the planet the MANAGER has to pay for upkeep, and the infrastructure gave a bonus or some such thing?

**TheDoctor1786**:	Kinda! So there are two different types of upkeep


[26-Apr-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	There's COGC upkeep which funds the program that provides planetwide bonuses (25% construction bonus for Danakil)


[26-Apr-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	And then there's Population Infrastructure upkeep which funds the buildings that keep workers happy and continuing to migrate to / not leave your planet


[26-Apr-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	So the population infrastructure doesn't really get a bonus, but it promotes worker stability and growth


[26-Apr-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	This has a LOT of detail but goes beyond the wiki in its explanation of planetary populations

**cellozzo**:	oh ok, so the worker we employ in our private structure are capped, if we hit the maximum of some kind of worker we'll not be able to build more structure ore better we could but we couldn't get anymore workers


[26-Apr-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	that's coll


[26-Apr-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	cool


[26-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yes, the infrastructure makes workers happy, and happiness affects the immigration rates


[26-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if we dont keep happiness up, workers leave and we lose population


[26-Apr-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	and the planet goes unpopulated, no workers no structure no players

[27-Apr-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Our Algorithm, who art in PrUN, hallowed be thy programming. Thy POPR come, thy redistribution be done, on each of our sacred planets. Give us this day our Required Workforce, and forgive us if we cuss you out for shortchanging us yet again you stupid fucking piece of code. Lead us not into unfilled production lines, but deliver us full workforce efficiency. Godspeed.


[27-Apr-22 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Prayers aside, shouldn't be short PIOs and hopefully settlers will be all set and we can move on to Techs, but let me know if you're missing anything after the report and I'll get it taken care of :)

[27-Apr-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Hello friends! Another exciting week as our population has nearly doubled again! Couple of quick notes from the POPR. Huge number of pioneers so new player expansion won't be an issue. We have almost twice as many as we need so we'll bleed a little through education to avoid paying for infrastructure that's not needed. Once we drop below 20% unemployment we'll make sure to get additional infrastructure up so there's lots of buffer for people to grow. It appears that the family support program we ran didn't have a huge effect (only about another 100 settlers), so I'm open to suggestions on what program to run next.


[27-Apr-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	My understanding of the Open Jobs field is that it's a pre-change field so we should have a small surplus of settlers, but if that's not accurate and anyone is missing settlers please get in touch. Current plan is to run for another week at the infrastructure levels we have now before shifting focus to bringing some techs in. As always, please reach out with questions - Viva Danakil!

**TheDoctor1786**:	Base planner! Little complicated but just look at the first two tabs


[29-Apr-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Workforce cost should include RAT, DW, OVE, PWO, and COF (for pioneers)


[29-Apr-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	But this will calculate it all for you

***rafoids** left.*


[29-Apr-22 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	You should treat cost of workforce producing RAT and DW as the same - doesn't matter if they're eating RAT and DW they're making, they're still eating RAT and DW that costs money


[29-Apr-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	sure, but my cost for the RAT and DW isn't the market cost


[29-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	No but you could be selling it at the market cost


[29-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	So it still costs you the market cost, just in money you could be getting rather than money you're spending


[29-Apr-22 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	all except the part i need to produce, so no, i'cant sell them or my workers are going to die ahahah... you're thinking is sound enough and was my first tought but in the production of DW and RAT isn't accurate

[29-Apr-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	obviously if i produce DW and sell it on the market i earn let's say 70NCC


[29-Apr-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Sure


[29-Apr-22 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	but if i want to calculate the cost of that production using DW for my work force i can't consider 70 NCC as a single cost of production of a DW


[29-Apr-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	You can and you should XD


[29-Apr-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I understand your line of reasoning - it's not the true cost of production


[29-Apr-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	The true cost of production is somewhat recursive


[29-Apr-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes that


[29-Apr-22 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	But since you're selling Drinking Water, it makes sense to treat the accounting as the value at which you *could* sell it for


[29-Apr-22 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	you can start with H20... prodiction H2O cost its only fee... and continue more


[29-Apr-22 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Okay @Cellozo if you want to get really math about it


[29-Apr-22 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Technically if you produce enough drinking water to feed the people making drinking water, your cost of produciton of DW is only the cost of the other consumables

[29-Apr-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Now consider that your output is diminished so that makes all the other units of DW that don't get eaten by your boys artificially higher cost to produce


[29-Apr-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	DW = H2O fee + H2O minimum prize + DW fee


[29-Apr-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	i've tryied but i'm stuck with an equation at 2 variables


[29-Apr-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Cellozo what's your equation


[29-Apr-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Elnor yes but with consumables


[29-Apr-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	The tricky bit is if you're producing your inputs, what is the cost of production


[29-Apr-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	you can ignore consumables when you produce consumables with self production


[29-Apr-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	and calculate only what you buy like OVE, COF and PWO


[29-Apr-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I would argue you should actually not ignore consumables beacuse if you do you have to treat cost of production of the other units of DW higher


[29-Apr-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Right like if you ignore the input then you're producing less output


[29-Apr-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Which makes it look like you have a super high cost of production


[29-Apr-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Which you don't, but your accounting treatment is making you look like you do


[29-Apr-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	5.2DW+52RAT+175.25=48DW

**TheDoctor1786**:	Subtract 5.2DW from both sides


[29-Apr-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Problem solved XD


[29-Apr-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	in this equation i consider DW and RAT for my workers only for h2o and dw production, plus PG and OVE


[29-Apr-22 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	i have easy exel for this. Just make ask to Jedi Order discor


[29-Apr-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Cellozo you set up your equation right, you have DW on both sides


[29-Apr-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Just subtract 5.2


[29-Apr-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	*5.2DW


[29-Apr-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	DW its realy easy to calculate


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	So 52RAT + 175.25 = 42.8 DW


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	The problem with that


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	why? i use that 5.2DW during the production of more DW

[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Sure


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	sorry it was 5.2 RAT too


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Sure doesn't matter


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	5.2RAT + 175.25 = 42.8 DW


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	You have DW on both sides of the equation


[29-Apr-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Just subtract


[29-Apr-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes i did it and solved the equation


[29-Apr-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	so DW=0.121RAT+4.10


[29-Apr-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Amazing


[29-Apr-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Well and PWO and COF and OVE


[29-Apr-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	And PG and H2O if you're buying those


[29-Apr-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	But yes


[29-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	then i use this forumla in the first equation but the result doesn't make sense


[29-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	What do you mean?


[29-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	i consider only OVE and PG and that was that 175.25


[29-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	market cost


[29-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Ahh okay


[29-Apr-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Use PWO and COF, but okay


[29-Apr-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	but you must calculate with OVE, PWO,COF in produce H2O


[29-Apr-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes but that's the easy part no problem, for them i use market cost couse i buy them


[29-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	just calculate with item cost with full workforce for CX cost... this its more easy


[29-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	(You should also use market cost for RAT and DW)


[29-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	(Even if you make them)


[29-Apr-22 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Or alternatively the formula you have above


[29-Apr-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	If you sell DW, how is it possible that the DW that your people drink and the DW that you sell are worth different amounts


[29-Apr-22 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I understand that *to you* it is. And from a cash flow perspective it is


[29-Apr-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	But from a cost of goods sold perspective it is not


[29-Apr-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	if you overprize the product you have more frofit for you out of calculations


[29-Apr-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes but replacing the last result in the first formula the result was something like 0.5 and it's a number that doesn't make sense i think i created the equation wrong


[29-Apr-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	well...guys, thanks for all the advices but i have to go now.. see you soon


[29-Apr-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Haha okay


[29-Apr-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I promise you using market price is the correct answer


[29-Apr-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	oh yes is good enough but not correct ahahaha


[29-Apr-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	No it is correct


[29-Apr-22 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I promise you


[29-Apr-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	(From an accounting perspective / cost of goods perspective)


[29-Apr-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	From a cash flow perspective it is not


[29-Apr-22 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	when you have uncorect minimum product prize you produce lot of shadow money... overprized product its safe way


[29-Apr-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	So if he sets his equations up properly it shouldn't matter


[29-Apr-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Right like any discount from DW is made up for in higher cost to produce (because you're producing less units since you're drinking some yourself)


[29-Apr-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	It's just way harder to understand and set up


[29-Apr-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	i calculate workforfe maintrance with CX prize and final product i multiple with 2-2,5. This is my minimum prize of product


[29-Apr-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Makes sense to me!


[29-Apr-22 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	There are many details in the calculation. Building maintenance, gasoline price, building wear, etc.


[29-Apr-22 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	and if you need cheap product you need hight Overall Efficiency. You produce more with the same amount and the same fee like with low Overall Efficiency


[29-Apr-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yep yep, I use Rain's base planner it works well

**Ron_Simmons**:	ashamed*


[04-May-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Elnor**:	I'm not trying to win this conversation. It would be enough to reject my offer and try to sell your goods on


[04-May-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ron_Simmons**:	rejected


[04-May-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Xitek Thank you for asking! If you could pop up a single building that requires techs that would be lovely (would be super lovely if it's before the POPR).


[04-May-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Cirop I'd reccomend asking that in the United Factions Operations discord channel, it's usually a little livlier


[04-May-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Ron it looks like MOR might have some decent SWF usage if you don't want to go to Antares - 377 traded in the last 7 days and there's only 34 up right now

[04-May-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Honestly, that offer is less than half the most recent price on the CX and represents selling at a loss, so I'm not really sure it counts as making an offer


[04-May-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yeah if you can find a dedicated buyer that's definitely preferable (in my mind), and I'm sure the demand exists, I just couldn't tell you who to talk to


[04-May-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	How did you end up with SWF though?


[04-May-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ron_Simmons**:	I already made the profit selling bbh in hortus, I just need to sell it back at market rate


[04-May-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ron_Simmons**:	i got a good deal on it


[04-May-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ah


[04-May-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ron_Simmons**:	and i dont have to exchange ica


[04-May-22 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ron_Simmons**:	like i said if i sell it all at market i still profit but if i can sell at 130 i can get a smelter


[04-May-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Sadly, I'm sitting on close to 1k myself

[04-May-22 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Hello friends! You may have noticed the POPR ticked over - wonderful news, Pioneers and Settlers are both stable and at comfortable levels. The slight negative drop in Pioneers was intentional and was to reduce the excessive number of unemployed pioneers (almost 30k unemployed last week, 30k this week), we should stay stable at current levels for the forseeable future and will build safety stations as needed to maintain workers.


[04-May-22 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	TheDoctor1786 anything I can do at my base to help?


[04-May-22 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Axe08**:	Same, new here


[04-May-22 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	With this exciting development, we're now ready to move on to Technicians! I'm looking to source suppliers (please reach out to me if you can fulfill this) for upkeep materials (SOI, FOD especially), as well as the HABs required to build the wildlife park which we'll need for technicians. If you'd like to help drive technician growth, now would be a wonderful time to pop down any technician requiring buildings you have, with the understanding that we're working as quickly as possible but you may experience delays in getting full Tech population. As always, please let me know if you have any questions - Viva Danakil!


[04-May-22 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Smitty, @Axe, welcome! At this point I'd reccomend investing to build your bases up, though you're more than happy to manufacture upkeep materials that can be difficult to find and I'll buy those off you - TUB for our Infirmaries, and PFE, FOD, DEC, SOI for the Wildlife park are the tricky ones, though they're tough to manufacture for new players.


[04-May-22 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Actually FOD's quite easy but I'm not sure what you all are doing for your industries


[04-May-22 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Short answer is just by building your base up you generate more tax revenue which lets me invest in more things for the planet, so that or the simpler upkeep materials are probably how you could best get involved.


[04-May-22 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Danakil sounds like we need a discord.


[04-May-22 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xitek**:	Whens the live debate? lets get this election drama goin lol


[05-May-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Hello Everyone! The Governor election has just started on Danakil and I'd humbly like to ask for your consideration. Within my time here I've: 1. Personally Invested in Danakil: Funded the Planetary Administration Center (lets you have Govs and run the planet), and Warehouse Units (extra space), in addition to supporting Danakil with a blank check interest free loan to help support it's growth. 2. Stabilized infrastructure: POPI investment (SST 1->2, INF 0->1), brought settlers to Danakil (3000->8000), while managing Pioneers throughout the new player wave (>150 bases added with no disruption to pioneers). 3. Advocated for Moving to Danakil: Served as an advocate for both new and more established players to join us on Danakil (COGC participation has gone from 3 to 14 people, and hopefully elections will follow suit!).


[05-May-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	In my next term I'd like to focus on bringing Technicians to the planet. Tier 3 workers are an important stage in any planet's lifecycle, and securing these workers will drive more high value production and individuals onto Danakil. This translates into more activity on the LM, more shipping contracts, and most importantly, more money for all of our residents. As always, I would love to hear from all of you with any thoughts, preferences, or focus areas you may have, and will be incorporating anything I hear that has resounding approval - please don't hesitate to reach out in game or on Discord (Capt. JT Kirk#1753). Have a wonderful rest of your day, and Viva Danakil!


[05-May-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-May-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BambooShoots**:	Why are construction fees higher than all the others?


[05-May-22 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Great question @Bamboo shoots! I mentioned this at the time but I think that was before you joined us haha


[05-May-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BambooShoots**:	Yeah, I'm new :)


[05-May-22 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	If you notice the COGC (planet-wide bonus) has been Construction for the last couple of weeks. That means that the entire construction industry gets a bonus, but nothing else does. When it's something like Pioneers or Settlers that's pretty evenly spread across industries, but construction obviously isn't. That means the upkeep and tax money used to fund the COGC is disproportionately going toward Construction, which is why I thought it was fair to tax them more


[05-May-22 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Did I explain that well?


[05-May-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BambooShoots**:	Yeah that makes sense and seems fair. Thanks for spelling it out. So I assume if people choose a different bonus you'll adjust accordingly?


[05-May-22 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yes! My thinking was that any even distribution (i.e. pios, settlers, etc.) wouldn't have any special treatment, any industry specific one would


[05-May-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BambooShoots**:	Well you've got my vote. I think you are doing a great job for Danakil. No reason to rock the boat now!


[05-May-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	You unfortunately cannot Silver - you have have a Pro lisence to use the local market. That being said, if you buy pro once (like for a month), you downgrade to basic rather than trial, which lets you accept (but not post) shipping ads on the local market


[05-May-22 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**JJNiero2000**:	Just started this game for the first time yesterday, got the construction package and a planet with H²O", SCR" and O", can anyone give some prosperous ideas or tips for a beginner?


[06-May-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	As a constructor you'll have to import all your inputs  more or less


[06-May-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that's not necessarily bad when you're small


[06-May-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	since the constructor bit is usually the most profitable part of that chain


[06-May-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The other thing is, you probably don't actually want the BMP


[06-May-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	(not sure some recipes might be good)


[06-May-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Oh got it, I was wondering if I was doing right importing a lot of stuff right at the beginning indeed, thanks


[06-May-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but this planet gives a 25% bonus to construction speed from the Chamber of Global Commerce


[06-May-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The PP1 benefits from that


[06-May-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the BMP doesn't


[06-May-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I see


[06-May-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Is it worth to build stuff to supply the materials i'm importing?


[06-May-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	The other benefit of being on Danakil is that shipping times are super constant (and oftentimes cheaper) than in system planets like Vallis


[06-May-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Early on no, long term potentially


[06-May-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Got it


[06-May-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-22 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	But i start using excel to organize everything today


[06-May-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-May-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	The early game is a lot of playing with spreadsheets


[06-May-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean you have so many possibilities early on


[06-May-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I'll try those later


[06-May-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I guess later on too


[06-May-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Now I can just make things happen


[06-May-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	although, well, some of the stuff I need can't always be bought


[06-May-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and some of my plans require waaaay too much shipping to be viable


[06-May-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Everything its a little bit confuse for me yet. I got the feeling i'm missing something or some oportunity right beneath my nose everytime and also loose myself in so much math and planning that I forgot what i was doing initially, lol. It was like that for you? I mean, i never played this kind of game before, but i'm ejoying a lot already


[06-May-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Oh yeah


[06-May-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	TBH, I COLIQed my first two companies


[06-May-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yep I COLIQ'd my first one because I went bankrupt


[06-May-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	then I tore down and rebuilt different buildings super aggressively


[06-May-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	if you wait more than an hour or two to tear down a building you lose some of the materials


[06-May-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I was chasing big profits in the relatively early days of the universe when prices were super volatile


[06-May-22 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean... I guess they are now too


[06-May-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My first company was a construction company in Antares and I couldn't get LST in those days


[06-May-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	my second was a construction company on Montem and I COLIQed because it was growing too slowly


[06-May-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I fear this first company of mine end up the same way (COLIQ), and so on until I learn everything, but i like trying to avoid it


[06-May-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	this is the third, and I actually started with 3 EXTs and a CHP (within a day or two; had to sell a lot of my starting stuff to buy different bfabs)


[06-May-22 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think the reason the third survived is because I realized you don't have to do what your recommended package tells you


[06-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Obviously the two experts you get for free help though


[06-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	oh...


[06-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	also, don't fly super fast in the beginning


[06-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Oh we have this too right?


[06-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	What are they use?


[06-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	The Experts


[06-May-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and realize that a decent chunk of your starting money is disguised as fuel in your ships' tanks


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	They add a bit of production speed to their industry


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You can use up to 6 per planet and up to 5 per industry


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You get 2 for free at the start


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Oh got it, so, just let them active


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and you get more as your production lines go


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think you have to manually choose them?"


[06-May-22 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	in the Experts button on the base


[06-May-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	it will then show you the efficiency gain

[06-May-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Got it


[06-May-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, so you get something like 6% to your chosen industry


[06-May-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	My ships still using the first fuel tank they come with


[06-May-22 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In my case for this company I was doing Resource Extraction and Chemistry, neither of which has an associated starter package


[06-May-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Didn't saw the fuel price yet, lol


[06-May-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Got it


[06-May-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At start the fuel prices were 24 for FTL and 16 for STL


[06-May-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So you could get quite a bit selling most of that fuel


[06-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Should I sell my stocked fuel?


[06-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Of course the other thing people do for money early on is trade between the CXs


[06-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If selling that fuel gets you another building today, it might be worth it


[06-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I mean, i didn't sell any of my package stuff


[06-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	otherwise, less so


[06-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You start with enough money for another building, I think?


[06-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Yes


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	40,000.00 NCC


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In my case I had to because no package starts with enough bfabs for a second EXT, much less a third


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	But I started on Montem and the prices for LST.NC1 were higher


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	er...


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	actually


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	around this


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	lol


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	before steam launch LST was down to about 50


[06-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I sold it for as high as 200 for a few days around when I started this company


[06-May-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	FE.NC1 was more expensive though


[06-May-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	The game on Steam is the same thing right, same game, or does it have some difference?


[06-May-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	same game


[06-May-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the only difference is that it doesn't run in your browser


[06-May-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Is the Pro license worth it?


[06-May-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think the FIO tools are a browser extension? Dunno I never actually used them


[06-May-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	For me yes


[06-May-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think it took a month or two before I got it


[06-May-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Although, right now you might be able to make a lot more early money with it


[06-May-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The two big things it lets you do at this stage are trading on the local market and recurring orders


[06-May-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the latter is super necessary when you have a lot of bases like me


[06-May-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the former means you could accept shipping contracts


[06-May-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Yeah, I was exploring the local markets but couldn't do almost anything


[06-May-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	when I first started there weren't really any people that were paying lots to have stuff shipped


[06-May-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and in a few months, we might be back towards that


[06-May-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	basically the two starter ships are way more than enough to run a single base


[06-May-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and the ship construction industry really only started about a couple months ago


[06-May-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Eventually the rich players will all have more ships


[06-May-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but right now they probably have more bases than they can comfortably handle


[06-May-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that said, Danakil is probably not the best place for shipping contracts


[06-May-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Oh got it, this game is kind recent I see, for how long have you being playing?


[06-May-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	405 days


[06-May-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	You can click on anyone's name to see how long their account / company has been around


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think 436 days is the universe age?


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	:D


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At least that's how long the governor of Montem has been playing


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Wow, thats a lot of time


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	HA I love that Rubi is the benchmark


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	But, it you COLIQ your company, this timer resets?


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, but in the early days we were all noobs


[06-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	The timer for your company does, not for your account


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ooh, that's a good point


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	correct ^


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So I've been playing for 410 days actually


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	My company has been around for 405


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but yeah, until a few months ago it was really, really hard to get advanced workers


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	So your first company had 5 days?


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	my second company had 4


[06-May-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the first one had 1


[06-May-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	lol :(


[06-May-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In all fairness, you can't look at the markets and prices without having a company


[06-May-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so it's kind of hard to plan an ideal start on the first shot


[06-May-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	well... there might be third party tools that show those things now


[06-May-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	https://fio.fnar.net/tradefinder


[06-May-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, so that might show prices


[06-May-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Yeah


[06-May-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	mostly if you want to buy from one CX and sell at another


[06-May-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think a few players sold their entire starting packages, then did trading for awhile


[06-May-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Makes sense


[06-May-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You could make 20-50% profit on the goods in your ship each way for a 1.5 day trip


[06-May-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Much more in some cases


[06-May-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm not sure if the differences are still as big


[06-May-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	C.IC1 C.NC1


[06-May-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That's a big one there


[06-May-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	RAT.IC1 RAT.NC1


[06-May-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Wow


[06-May-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	IC1 (Hortus) has a really good farm planet


[06-May-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so it tends to be a good place to buy C and food stuff


[06-May-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Yes, almost the double


[06-May-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	C won't equalize easily since it's heavy


[06-May-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean as a new player, you'd have trouble buying enough to fill the ship


[06-May-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but as an experienced player, you'd have trouble transporting C worth all your money


[06-May-22 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	RAT/DW less so


[06-May-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Captain weight heavy ship?


[06-May-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Even that kinda sucks though because it's 2250/1000 so you're still wasting quite a bit


[06-May-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, so the most you could ship is 1k C at a time, which is probably too much


[06-May-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That's close to the daily volume traded


[06-May-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Always an art to offloading your stuff without killing a market


[06-May-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The starter ships can only do like 200ish


[06-May-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	which is much easier to just sell


[06-May-22 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and still costs like 60k or something like that


[06-May-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Got it, i see that's a lot to learn about it yet


[06-May-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	It's my second day i think, I have 2 Pioneer Habitation, a Rig couse of the tutorial and a Prefab Plant MK1, I bought a hell lot of MCG and some Prefabs to build more structures, also some supply for my workforce, and almost all my 40,000.00 is gone lol, not all, i'm have 4,000 yet


[06-May-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	So much! But I promise it gets easier and less daunting


[06-May-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Make sure you have enough to cover taxes lol


[06-May-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I don't know what should i build next, i'm producing lots of water and some prefabs too, most BDE couse of the 1000 PE that came with the package


[06-May-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I was thinking about a farmstead to conciliate the gain while i recover the money since I have water, then a collector since I have O", and a Smelter. Than i could just bought iron ore and the rest would be here to produce FE, buy LSM and build BSE to sell at the CX


[06-May-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Idk it is a bad idea


[06-May-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	You said i don't need to worry about covering the supply of material at the beginning so i may change my mind


[06-May-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	just buy*, sorry for my english, i'm still learning


[06-May-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Dude your english is great you have nothing to apologise for


[06-May-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Jarvis2.0** left.*


[06-May-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Thank a lot, for all the tips too


[06-May-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Since there is a construction bonus program here (COGC) making BDE will be very efficient


[06-May-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if you can afford the input PE, it would be very good to make BDE here


[06-May-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	So keep in mind that Farmsteads will be slower than normal (They have negative efficiency on Danakil), but it's definitely an option

***caurito** left.*


[06-May-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, with the 25% bonus from the CoGC, a second PP1 might be the best choice


[06-May-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I haven't used looked at low tier recipes' profitability in awhile


[06-May-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Is it possible to Rename your company?


[06-May-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	No :(


[06-May-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Oh...


[06-May-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Only through COLIQ


[06-May-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Got it


[06-May-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Obviously I wasn't the Moria Limestone Company when I started in Antares :p


[06-May-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Well since i'm right in the beginning and nothing really happened yet (except all my 40000 ncc disappearing in a second if you catch my meaning) it's a good time to COLIQ if I wish to change some permanent things but nah, idk, feels like a power player and Idk if it have a bad impact in the game or does really nothing to others

**CapitanIncognito**:	If you have no open contracts (which you wont' as a free player) then it doesn't really hurt anyone


[06-May-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I'd say play with the spreadsheet some first


[06-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You might get new ideas


[06-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the downside of COLIQ for you is there's a timer before you can do it again


[06-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the first time it's short


[06-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but you can't really do it over and over and over


[06-May-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Oh yeah, you're right! I should experiment first, but the name is not that bad, just that i put "corp" for a matter of style in it and corp is something in the game already so... Got a little weird, a corporation that isn't a corporation


[06-May-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[06-May-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I kind of wanted some super generic name, but I couldn't come up with one, and ended up sticking with one that was intentionally going to become comically obsolete


[06-May-22 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Lol but it looks better than most part of the names I saw until now. I mean, theres even some jokes around as names


[06-May-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I like using things names like rocks, jewelry, plants, etc. Like Lotus, Emerald, etc

**TheDoctor1786**:	Hi everyone! Just want to share some good news - I've aquired the HABs and SOI to build the Wildlife Park! It should be ready (though not particularly filled) before the POPR. Will be looking to source FOD / PFE regularly so if you make either of these (newbies, FOD is profitable if you have a confirmed buyer like me, otherwise don't make it)

**TheDoctor1786**:	Wait what?? It's a week delayed?


[11-May-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Ohhhhhhh no there's a bug where the first week is free, right?


[11-May-22 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	no


[11-May-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	it just doesn't turn on until the next popr


[11-May-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so not really a week unless you build it right after the popr


[11-May-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think it's because you can set what level each building will run at for the next period in the LR


[11-May-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and that gets locked in even if the building is built/upgraded between periods


[11-May-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I thought I read on FIO that there was some bug the first level of a building

Not many at the moment, but all the open jobs are filled so please pop up more PP3s / other tech buildings if you'd like to help those grow! Tax rates will be adjusted (just for techs) now that we actually have techs. As always, let me know if there are any questions. Cheers!

[13-May-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	I have a docked ship that i'm not using and was thinking about it...


[13-May-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	there is no real accounting system in this game. so there is no automtic way to allocate costs to shipped items. Also costs of goods far from CX and NOT more expensive. Not sure why


[13-May-22 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	There is some arbitrage that is possible between CX's.  RAT and Fuel tend to be cheap on Hortus


[13-May-22 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	NCC prices are higher on most everything


[13-May-22 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JJNiero2000**:	Oh got it...


[13-May-22 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-May-22 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**stilrz**:	bad design is bad design. It is not reasonable or good


[16-May-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	Also it is SOOO easy to buy something when trying to sell


[16-May-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	Yeah, after looking it over I understood it. LM your selling a LOT and CX your selling individually from a LOT


[16-May-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	on LM at least


[16-May-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	I am willing to break down my overalls if someone needs only a custom amount.


[16-May-22 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@stilrz it's not bad design, it's very intentional. A local market is a contract - you pay x, you get y thing (or vice verca). There's no splitting of the package, it's a price per package. On the CX you're selling a bunch of units, not a bundle or a package, so you need to know the price per unit


[16-May-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	(Well, it being intentional doesn't make it not bad design, but)


[16-May-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	I will prolly selling them 15 at a time


[16-May-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Agree that it is SUPER easy to confuse a buy and sell order though, that's poorly designed and should be much clearer on the LM


[16-May-22 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmittyVentures**:	There now I broke down the orders for 1 month. @TheDoc my selling strategy made the planet some good ad money.

**TheDoctor1786**:	Ugh we love to hear it


[16-May-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-May-22 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-May-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Also: I can contribute for population infrastructure... what does that actually do?

**cellozzo**:	Hi Mnementh


[17-May-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I do! And I use them on things like the population infrastructure that you mentioned - you don't need to contribute to it (that's my job), but it makes sure we have workers of various types available


[17-May-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Ah, I see. So if I wanted to build an industry based around scientist I need to contribute towards infrastructure that supports scientist to get them to the planet.


[17-May-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Well the gov would contribute (although I suppose if you were extremely wealthy and wanted to you could speed things along)


[17-May-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	But conceptually yes you're correct


[17-May-22 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	Hello Friends!! Brief update here - technicians are on the rise! Pioneer and Settler populations are plentiful (Pioneers are a taaaad bit low, I'd like closer to 20% unemployment as a safe buffer but hopefully settlers bleeding off will help that number since they're a little high). Most importantly though, we have over 100 technicians (doubled from last week) and 55% happiness! We'll continue to fill the PAR and keep running Happiness programs to attract the techs, but please put up more tech buildings! At the moment we have a surplus and giving them more jobs is the best way to attract them. Thank you as always, and let me know if there are any questions!

**flakboy**:	So about the ads for buying 100 H2O...I have H2O to sell in the amount, but it tells me my company rating is insufficient. The rating in the ad is Pending...is this because I'm a trial license?


[24-May-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	Oh wow yeah technicians are phemonenal - more than doubling every week now which is great. Pioneer and Settler numbers will probably fluctuate a bit as we go up and down from happiness / needs fulfillment levels, but we have a pretty good buffer right now! Name of the game is going to be maintain operations until people are generally happy with the number of techs and then evaluate from there! As always, let me know if there are any questions, Viva Danakil!

[02-Jun-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Hi Everyone! Excited to be running for Danakil Gov again. In the past few weeks our big accomplishment was bringing stable techs to Danakil! We've seen explosive growth in this regard both from the Wildlife park going up as well as from everyone setting up PP3s to create additional demand (thank you for everyone willing to take that leap of faith)! My next term will be focused on Tech and overall operational stability. I'm going to closely monitor population / need fulfillment levels to make sure we have consistantly the right amount of workers (without too much excess, so we're not overpaying on upkeep), and work with the community to understand where they'd like to focus next. Thank you all for your consideration, as always, please reach out with any questions. Viva Danakil!


[02-Jun-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Thanks @TheDoctor1786 for your work in the current term. @Elnor, what are your promises for your run? Cheap fuel? RATs in different colorations? JEDI Order will defend Danakil against the Sith Empire?


[02-Jun-22 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Elnor**:	as a second candidate I know how much work is worth TheDoctor1786. TheDoctor does a good job. I can promise anything, but being a governor is hard work. I believe I can represent his office, but at the moment I am only a replacement if the Governor wants to rest.

**flakboy**:	Good morning. @[JEDI] cellozzo, may I ask how many Rigs are you using. Carbon Farmer myself, just trying to find the right Rig to Farmstead Ratio...


[13-Jun-22 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	i have 6 rigs for 6 farmstead


[13-Jun-22 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	and i produce DW too so i use 80 a day for DW and the rest for farming


[13-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**flakboy**:	Yeah, that's kinda what I was worried about...the rigs are slow producing here, so I kept bottlenecking on water. Expansion is going to be expensive.


[13-Jun-22 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cellozzo**:	yes, the other only good thing is that as this isn't a good planet for farming (or better there are better planets out there) there are few farmer here so you don't have any problem selling DW and RAT on the local market so you don't have to ship it to CX to sell them

[20-Jun-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-22 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	O.o then it seems I have cut into your lfab business here


[20-Jun-22 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**stilrz**:	each uses dozens of AL


[20-Jun-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	next day or so I will do 2 base upgrades  -- and then more smelters or hopefully something more interesting


[20-Jun-22 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

**stilrz**:	no room


[20-Jun-22 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-22 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	now I have to resort to YI-280D and purchasing a 3k hauler

[20-Jun-22 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Jun-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ron_Simmons**:	ahh ok


[28-Jun-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	oh btw if someone has AL production capacity I would love to purchase whatever you got to sell up to like 3k units


[28-Jun-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ron_Simmons**:	messaged you Armorlord


[28-Jun-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jun-22 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jun-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	pm me ill be happy to make suggestions


[28-Jun-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jun-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BambooShoots**:	Ok i will thanks


[28-Jun-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BambooShoots**:	I was thinking about getting into Agriculture or Metalurgy to do just that ... Do you know of a good planet for either? What would you suggest?

[28-Jun-22 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jun-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Oooooh wait new problem it's not his first base so he can't do the normal starter planets


[28-Jun-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I was going to say Prom for Agri but that doesn't work either


[28-Jun-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Maybe Verdant?


[28-Jun-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I need an absoloute minimum of 72 AL per day


[28-Jun-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	smelt away


[28-Jun-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	if I could secure additional sources I would happily build more PP2s, perhaps even double


[28-Jun-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	we created a dedicated AL pipeline to supply the bases here, but thats a multi-planet chain


[28-Jun-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	if you got excess to sell I got 5 mil credits standing by


[28-Jun-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Bamboo you could always build stuff that links to your already existing supply chain - not always the most profitable but ensures stability


[28-Jun-22 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	Im also a big fan of Celebdil, get that tasty ALO


[29-Jun-22 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	agree with the celebdil analysis, will be my next target for ALO production


[29-Jun-22 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	@armorlord I usually have extra AL on Celebdil if you are trying to get more as well


[29-Jun-22 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	Getting it from Cele to Vallis to smelt to Danakill to be made into Lfabs is the fun part


[29-Jun-22 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	3 of us could easily fill his  big ship


[29-Jun-22 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	cele>vallis>danakil is my pipeline too lol


[29-Jun-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	it is about to be my pipeline as well, I just sweeped the dust away from the drone manufactories which are now headed to malahat, and vallis is about to be stuffed with smelters


[29-Jun-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	so if ya'll are interested we can definitely start setting up shipping routes


[29-Jun-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I asked Rek to be put back in queue for a second 3kt, likely will be built in 5 weeks or so


[29-Jun-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	my 2k is always full on the way sadly, theres a huge ALO surplus to get through


[29-Jun-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	sometimes vallis>denakil has room


[29-Jun-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	yeah 3kt is the way to go for ores


[29-Jun-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	seems 2k eats twice the fuel....


[29-Jun-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	my 3kt uses about the same FF as my standard ship, maybe 20%-40% more SF for the same travel times


[29-Jun-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	of course I could have ordered a bigger reactor but then the fuel would be eaten like candy

**TheDoctor1786**:	Hey Everyone! It's everyone's favorite election time again. Apologies for being relatively absent, I've been dealing with a nasty cough from COVID. At the moment worker counts are pretty stable (slight decline is fine given the super high unemployment rates), so things will be pretty quiet for the next month - will look at what we can do to slightly reduce taxes now that we're a bit more stable assuming we'll be at this population / plot count for a while. As always, please let me know if there are any questions and would love any suggestions you all have, Viva Danakil!


[30-Jun-22 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jul-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The only really bad part is quarantining while on vacation and a mild headache


[01-Jul-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	I have a question. Apparently people do a lot of construction on Danakil. And I wonder why, as Danakil has no metallic resources or stones for it. Is there a reason I don't see?


[01-Jul-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	The chamber of global commerce vote has traditionally gone to construction which gives it a whopping 25% bonus.

**TheDoctor1786**:	That's like half of it, the other half is its proximity to the CX and MOR system. It's a super consistant 4-5 hour trip with relatively low fuel usage since it's a single FTL hop away


[01-Jul-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Yeah well, but Montem and Vallis are zero hops away from CX :-)


[01-Jul-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	And they have resources.


[01-Jul-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Sure but zero hops isn't always better


[01-Jul-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Right now on standard fuel settings it's 9 hours to Montem, 7 hours to Danakil


[01-Jul-22 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Oh interesting, so the jump is faster than flying STL in the same system.


[01-Jul-22 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BambooShoots**:	Montem and Vallis also have 0 base slots available (unless you are new)


[01-Jul-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	That is true.


[01-Jul-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	The jump *can be faster*, it just doesn't really change all that much unlike STL flight which changes depending planetary alignment rather drastically

[11-Jul-22 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	If you open a buffer and type "LM OT-442b" you open the local market for our beautiful planet Danakil. That is also accessible via the planet-view. In this list you see ads for contracts with other players. That includes shipping contracts. But I think to accept such a contract you need PRO (meaning paying for the game).


[11-Jul-22 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	And the game can be very intimidating at first.


[11-Jul-22 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Yes, there is a way to start over, which is typing in a new buffer the command "COLIQ". Then you can choose a new starter package and starter planet.


[11-Jul-22 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	You lose everything you've done so far. Probably not much in 20 minutes.


[11-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yoloninja**:	ahhh, cheers. out of intrest, is there a starter package the community really needs rn? somthing to address a shortage maybe?


[11-Jul-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Phew, I am not sure and it also probably depends on the planet you choose.


[11-Jul-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yoloninja**:	ahhh. fairs


[11-Jul-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	As shipping cost goes up with distance of the systems something that is in abundance in one system can be short in another.


[11-Jul-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TheDoctor1786**:	Hi friends! There's been an ask for more Techs to fulfill PP3 workforce, so I've ran the happiness program, which should help things a bit and I'll refill the wildlife park - that being said, best way to increase migration is to have open jobs, so make sure you puts your buildings up!


[26-Jul-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	more techs! more techs!


[26-Jul-22 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Here’s to hoping I don’t put up my PP3s just to see an over correction for INS


[26-Jul-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Guvna- when we put up buildings that require techs/engineers/scientists - is there a way we should/have to contribute to population upkeep?


[26-Jul-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You have an AR supply for those?


[26-Jul-22 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	Split between cross galaxy supply runs or starting a base. 500k to start though, and would need to wait for at least two weeks


[26-Jul-22 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	(500k at current INS/AEF going rate, roundabout)

[26-Jul-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dinglebop**:	I'm well positioned to start a new base but the ins for it is an issue atm. If i laid down a pp3 before i had one id probably just buy from any ask i can find if they crop up or deal in something else for a while

[27-Jul-22 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Although, the CL that gets made along with it is pretty nice


[27-Jul-22 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jul-22 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jul-22 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	are you good on materials for the jump start?


[27-Jul-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I'm about to dump a small amount of INS on the market because I wouldn't have the pops to build more


[27-Jul-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... although I should get the pops in 2 days


[27-Jul-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah i would hold onto it


[27-Jul-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but then again, long term I don't know that 6 COLs is sustainable


[27-Jul-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think I used to run 4?


[27-Jul-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the base turned mostly into a PG factory


[27-Jul-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	ah


[27-Jul-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	back when AR was down at 200 or less


[27-Jul-22 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I suspect both AR and INS will crash hard in a month or so


[27-Jul-22 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	they've been too high for too long


[27-Jul-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its bigger than that, its that most of the players running the GG bases have been on break


[27-Jul-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so theres an overall shortage of GG resources and a lot of newer players looking to start up those bases


[27-Jul-22 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I'm kind of wavering on this game


[27-Jul-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the ship upgrade update will be a big market shift i think


[27-Jul-22 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, should let more people get into ship building


[27-Jul-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jul-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	You can take the price of the cheapest offer in the closest CX (Moria Station) and add shipping cost to that. That is the price of importing it. That seems like a good place to start.


[31-Jul-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Two different schools of thought - some people sell cheap because they don't want to bother with logistics, some people sell high because they're saving people on planet who don't want to bother with logistics the trouble of getting it over

**Shalkka**:	Can I as a FREE player be party to the new custom transfer contracts between Moria CX and Danakil if a PRO player creates them?


[03-Aug-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Aug-22 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Since there are a lot of construction people on Danakil .. I have a question.  What would yall see more important on the market ... the need for FE or the need for AU?


[16-Aug-22 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Kinda depends what you mean by important but FE is traded constantly for construction and AU rarely because the electronics market is comparatively dead.

[17-Aug-22 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	From my side all I see are numbers from the market.  Constructing items outside of my selected profession pretty unlikely.  So I am trying to get the perspective of those that are on the other side of the isle.


[17-Aug-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	@tief Danakil is great for those mining AL elsewhere and building Lfabs here. I would also go after making HMS or even PE


[19-Aug-22 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	@stilrz I am calling it at metallurgy.  Many pots are nice to dip into but overall I have seen it strangle player made economies by encouraging private production (non market sales)


[19-Aug-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I saw 0 demand products for metallurgy.  So either its not wanted/needed or its just done in private to never hit the market.


[19-Aug-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	which products are you referring to specifically? I would agree things like AU and CU are usually done privatey


[19-Aug-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Products that fall under the Hull Welding Plant


[19-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	ATP for one of the items


[19-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	oh sure, theres a lot of shipbuilding items that are basically not used


[19-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	they are too expensive for the very small benefit they provide


[19-Aug-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Right, but I have had a couple convos about should be going into some type of manufacturing job.  There is plenty to do within metallurgy by itself beyond smelting.


[19-Aug-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	So I am trying to understand that side of production without going into it myself


[19-Aug-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Clarification what can metallurgy provide to a manufacturer


[19-Aug-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i would focus more on what metallurgy can provide to constructors


[19-Aug-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as Danakil is a constructor haven, and many people also do it on montem


[19-Aug-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	yeah its all manufacturing to me.  So understanding what one resource weighs vs others helps me understand the needs


[19-Aug-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i just make the differentiation as construction and manufacturing are two different industries in this game, the Chamber of Global Commerce gives a 25% bonus to only one at a time


[19-Aug-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	theres a lot more manufacturing in the Benten system, while theres almost no construction there.


[19-Aug-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	each building type only gets the bonus when it matches the COGC, which is hugely important


[19-Aug-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I will learn to differentiate better.


[19-Aug-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	a really good way to pick up the differences is looking at the build menu and all the classifications for each building


[19-Aug-22 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I was just trying to be social while learning.


[19-Aug-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	sorry if it came off as mean, was just trying to help D:


[19-Aug-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i appreciate the intent!


[19-Aug-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Nah you are good.  not everything comes across as it should through text.


[19-Aug-22 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I agree, it is a numbers game.  But from a starting perspective it is also a good choice to try and understand the needs of where you start.  Potentially allowing more needs to be met locally than primarily focusing on cx sales.  There are 2 ways of going about sales.  Either produce more than you need to for private buyers to sell on cx or primarily focus on the cx for full pricing.


[19-Aug-22 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	exactly right. the logistics of moving the goods also is important


[19-Aug-22 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	very heavy things like FE and STL are almost cost prohibitive to move both directions


[19-Aug-22 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Yeah I have been looking at material weights for a couple days


[19-Aug-22 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Danakil uses a lot of AL as it can be imported easily over other metals


[19-Aug-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Al is pretty light... ALO is lighter .. I am just messing with a spreadsheet to find my balance


[19-Aug-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Been messing with extraction > smelting for days but I think I am going to settle with solely smelting


[19-Aug-22 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	You mean smelting aluminum on Danakil?


[19-Aug-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I mean I could ... I have been looking at mining then smelting but it seems cheaper to just CX raw and smelt


[19-Aug-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	It's not very profitable on Danakil, thought. You will do a lot better constructing, even without but especially with the construction bonus on Danakil.


[19-Aug-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	*though


[19-Aug-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Or just do anything else...smelting is not great right now unless you're on Vallis or somewhere with the bonus and even then...


[19-Aug-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Quick and dirty estimate for smelting you're buying 6 ALO at 135 1 C at 450 and 1 O at 83. So 1343 in and you sell the 3 AL you get at the CX for 1650 after 12 hours of labour.


[19-Aug-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	That's 26 NCC per hour profit.


[19-Aug-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Buy 150 PE at the CX for 6.34 total 951 in and 6 hours later you make a BDE that sells for 1423.


[19-Aug-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	79 per hour.


[19-Aug-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I chose Danakil not for AL but for S


[19-Aug-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I am weighing options for future expansion since one day I should


[19-Aug-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Just make money and expansion will come exponentially and doesn't have to be linked to what you start with.


[19-Aug-22 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Danakil is a fine place to start but I would not advise to get going by producing S.

[19-Aug-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	But is there any demand for it?


[19-Aug-22 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	There is for both S and SCR.  S is for SEA, BAC, BLE, IND production


[20-Aug-22 01:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	0 bids for S right now. It’ll move eventually but not ideal.


[20-Aug-22 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	S moves appx every 3 days according to market data


[20-Aug-22 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	alternatively scr also sells at the same price in moria roughly


[20-Aug-22 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Its a nice game don't get me wrong but for it to promote gameplay and the player base doesn't consider it worth it doesn't look too good.

**CutterJon**:	When you’re starting out stock sitting around for three days is a big deal.


[20-Aug-22 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Huh? The gameplay is to understand how the economy works and optimize to meet it.


[20-Aug-22 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Unless you mean S production on Danakil was promoted in the starting package. Still, you can and made money. But the way the economy has developed there are better options right now.


[20-Aug-22 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	So where is the sandbox if its just meeting the economy instead of sandboxing a specific part.  First, metallurgy is promoted to new players by it showing them its an option.  Second, out of all the planets you can pick Danakil was one of them for the path chosen.  I am trying to understand why people don't accept the path.  Out of all the options this was the most ideal outside of "artificially" placing a base on a starter planet that has no room.


[20-Aug-22 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	I am more confused about it than anything.

[20-Aug-22 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	It’s a sandbox in the sense that you can make whatever you want, but the real novelty of this game is that it is a (relatively) living, breathing economy. So things change and opportunities come and go via market forces as the universe evolves. I think maybe your frustration/confusion is feeling that you were steered towards metallurgy on Danakil but are now being told there are better ways to go? All I can say is the economy is complex and even if the starting packages were optimal today they might not be tomorrow.


[20-Aug-22 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Maybe over the next few weeks S becomes easier to sell for more money due to the changes they made to the ship upgrades, and people vote to make the Danakil bonus Metallurgy so smelting S becomes way more profitable than construction. I dunno. I’m just passing on what will make the most money for a startup here now. Most people choose to adapt to one of those paths because thriving is fun.

**Tief**:	Think its after the fact of establishing the trade.  Matching profession + faction for the bonuses.  Establishing the base and then being nailed that it's not the way to go.


[20-Aug-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tief**:	Now for voting bonus is nice but its like me geared for metallurgy doing construction.  I would be dependent on the voting bonus to make some money and it wouldnt be near the profits of those geared for construction from the start.

I come to you humbly to ask for another term to continue serving the people of this lovely planet. Together, we've gone from just a few pioneers to a robust engineer economy while building ourselves into a construction destination for MOR and the adjacent systems. I'm happy to take feedback on our direction going forward, but in the short term I've gone ahead and decreased tax rates slightly as we're pretty stable population wise. Please feel free to get in touch - always love to hear how I can better serve the community :)

**CutterJon**:	Those are pretty serious allegations. I'm going to need to see some proof of this canine abuse before I get involved in a poetry war.


[18-Sep-22 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CutterJon**:	Although seriously, although I wish something was repeated other than "the" but yours is the best. The others have too much sentence structure for haiku.

**DogeConomy**:	(+10/u above your acquisition price)


[06-Feb-23 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ah well, guess nobody cares around here in this desolate planet


[06-Feb-23 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	No, it’s more that all the items you want have to be imported and you want to only pay 10 NCC more per unit to get you out of a hole.  At least for me it is not worth it


[06-Feb-23 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	+ 30 a unit then


[06-Feb-23 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	so even If I wanted to donate, I couldn't


[06-Feb-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	guess I'll just tide it out this time round


[06-Feb-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	The mark up on LDE is huge, sell to buys and you are still making money.


[06-Feb-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	kinda hoped that It didn't have to come to this, since I wanted my first batch to cover the cost of constructing the base. Probably set my expectations too high.


[06-Feb-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I need some advice: Should I post MOR --> DAN shipping orders on the Danakil or Moria CX LM?


[06-Feb-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Cash flow is king, get the money and re invest.


[06-Feb-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Gotcha


[06-Feb-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but in my situation it kinda isn't


[06-Feb-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	because i'd have to return to CX again every 2 days to get the flow


[06-Feb-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Guess I have to start grindin' again


[06-Feb-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	i'll do 55/u, same corp price as wb-948c. you send a 2t/2t up there?


[08-Feb-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	I don't have a base out there yet, but I have one half-way in-between on IZ-911i    Hope to start making SF  soon.

[08-Feb-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	I'm even in the process of completing a shipment from Antares to Hubur.  Which I'm sure someone on MOntem would say is stupid, but I was headed there anyway (and at Antares at the time).


[08-Feb-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	not stupid at all. there was a great deal on caf that i missed.


[08-Feb-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	But I'm not supposed to mention that on Montem; as it gives NOOBs the wrong idea!


[08-Feb-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	i have 715 alo on 948c if you want them, same 55/u if that is more convenient at times. just let me know, i will probably have to build at least 1 pp3 if not 2 to make the ins to upkeep and expand. flx is starting on mon as well. hit me up if you need anything and i can help. im one of those noobs that had to learn by doing


[08-Feb-23 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	5 ext going on both, alo needs a home


[08-Feb-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	i need like 2 more ships lol


[08-Feb-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	I'd be happy with at least one more ship myself.  I'll have to see where that planet is and will be in touch.  I get other things via Hubur as well though.  I was bringing LTA's back from there: selling half here and rebuying 1.25 there again for each one I sold.


[08-Feb-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	BSE's are only 1K out there ASK   and  1.3K here bid!


[08-Feb-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valencia_Minh**:	they take ncc, love that


[08-Feb-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stohrm**:	One ship here and one there.  You can sell here and immediately buy it back there and end up with way more than you had to start.   But again, if you're not getting your fuel at the right price  it's just not worth it.

[08-Mar-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	at least the high numbers mean bigger education transitions so it looks like we're doing okay. Also i'm planning on putting down a PP3 within a week

[16-Mar-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	well lots of the big guys come for the construction bonus, i've turned this into a manufacturing base


[16-Mar-23 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xavier23**:	The thing is that the price of food in the nearest CE is very high so maybe I could get good rates


[16-Mar-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**flakboy**:	I just added the third food processor since I was having trouble keeping up with my normal dw and rat needs.


[16-Mar-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	i highly recomend just buying the water and praying neigrozni or however youspell it dosnt decide to be a dick again


[16-Mar-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	and eventually build a dedicated water base could be a good move too, if you intend to stick with farming


[16-Mar-23 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	idk i havnt been able to come up with a source in this area that has a unit cost [including repairs] of less than 30


[16-Mar-23 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**flakboy**:	True...but I do love the vertical organization I currently have. That's a thought...I am on my third permit, so I do still have expansion space.


[16-Mar-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	Etherwind is the water planet I have looked at for other reasons


[16-Mar-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	you can still be vertical i started vertical constructor on montem then transitioned to chem supporting danakil construction now the same chem will also vertically support ns and nab for hyf/foodpro and fuel just spread to 4 bases rather than crammed into one so 2k space vs 1k space for the same permits


[16-Mar-23 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	wait no one more permit i need more coffe lol


[16-Mar-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**flakboy**:	lol. That's fair. Initially I was always put off adding bases due to the cost...I'm at a much better position when setting something up off-world wouldn't be so far fetched, now.


[16-Mar-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	having 2 ships helps with that just try not to pick something weight intensive ii forgot to account for how heavy fe is and i was bringing in 100 a day plus limestone for a while


[16-Mar-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	it was nice to dedicate one ship to montem one to dana but ill be doing a north/south split with 4 bases

**BeBopLula**:	My advice would be refit as construction, the profit he is making is minimal compared to PPs.  I would pull down the rigs buy the water and build POL/PP2, convert carbon into PG, build LSE


[17-Mar-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	not sure if starting with tier2 is best solution for someone who is really unfamiliar with game


[17-Mar-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	... assuming he doesnt have $, too


[17-Mar-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	thats why PP1s come handy, mostly at todays prices


[17-Mar-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	later sure ... PP2, PP3 ...


[17-Mar-23 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	also why POL on Danakil?


[17-Mar-23 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no 2nd base???


[17-Mar-23 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	POL, I was trying to suggest an option that used the C.  POL on Danakil is still v profitable and considering that he gets no COGC bonus for INC/RIG/FP/FRM either did not seem that not having a Chem bonus would matter much


[17-Mar-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	he is also 300 days old and has built 1000 area base so this suggests building a PP2 would be reasonable.  Pulling down 13 rigs (assuming that they have not completely fallen into disrepair) would generate a reasonable cash pile and PP1 needs FE which is bulky


[17-Mar-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Alternative might be convert C into PE and then do PP1 into BDE, that would be cheaper


[17-Mar-23 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	looking at PrunNer, PE might actually be better route to profit than PG but PG.NC1 is very health as a commodity atm

**DogeConomy**:	Hello fellow Citizens of Danakil! As a governorship candidate for the ongoing election at Danakil, if elected, I will abolish both the Local Market and Warehouse fees (to support local businesses). I will also strive to keep taxes to a minimum, utilising the support of YI Conglomerate's resources and expertise. Upgrades on existing infrastructure will be done democratically, i.e whole planet referendum on which infrastructure to upgrade next every month (with associated costs to be listed). I will also help small base owners/newcomers to the planet with emergency supplies if required (e.g forgot to ship 1 MCG/fab over). Thanks for reading my speech of sorts, and I wish you all the best.


[06-Apr-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	P.S: if any of you want to help out with governorship duties, please contact me if and when I do get elected and we'll organise a shipping crew (pay included)*


[06-Apr-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*= stringent standards have to be met and maintained


[06-Apr-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If anyone's got any questions you'd like to ask or suggestions you'd like to put forward (i.e monthly planetary reports/stats). feel free to drop a comment here :)


[06-Apr-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I dont think you can reduce the LM and warehouse fees to zero.  I believe that you could but the rules have changed.  At least this is the case at the planet where I'm governor


[06-Apr-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Only non-faction space planets can set them to zero.


[06-Apr-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if that's the case I'll redistribute the wealth through a spinning of the name picker


[06-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Chiada**:	Hey what does the parenthesis in current workforce mean? As in 160(59), do i have 160 or 59? Whichever it is, what does the other mean?


[07-Apr-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you have 160 but are pulling the extra 59 temporary from the reserve workforce (until all workers update their status later this week to fill your position permanently)

[17-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nope but I should have space free regularly (I make the trip weekly)


[17-Apr-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Ship is Free (in terms of space) from MOR => DAN , Full from DAN => MOR


[17-Apr-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Also wanted to ask: would anyone be interested in me setting up a servo/petrol/gas station over here


[17-Apr-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	?


[17-Apr-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll sell BHPs, LHPs, SF and FF


[18-Apr-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	seems like no-one likes cheap fuel/ hull plates for maintenance lol


[18-Apr-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	I'm sorry but I only use propane and propane accessories


[18-Apr-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	For all of my interstellar fuel needs.


[18-Apr-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	But in all seriousness, fuel anywhere is a huge boon. Just make sure it is economically viable to make fuel here.


[18-Apr-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep since I haul AL out of here frequently and send empty ships here, that's why I've decided to make a base here


[18-Apr-23 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	If anyone's interested in buying SF/FF/BHP/LHP/SEA/T1 consumables locally (whenever you want, or long term), send me a DM and I'll invite you to a shopfront COMG (to save clutter from the planet chat) where we can discuss business.


[18-Apr-23 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bodian**:	I'll vouch for the DogeConomy ship/service solution. Very useful to bring my ships to 100% on trips through Danakil


[18-Apr-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh wait I just realised I had posted this on the wrong planet chat


[18-Apr-23 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	darn it how'd I mix up danakil with celebdil


[18-Apr-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	🤦


[18-Apr-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'd be happy to take shipping whenever I have free space though


[18-Apr-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Easily done, did think the comment about exporting AL from Danakil was strange


[18-Apr-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah probably @RNGZero 's joke comments about a "new aluminium supply at  danakil" that added to my confusion

**BLooo**:	yeah the CoGC loss was to painful to bear


[24-Apr-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	was it down for a full hour? not a big spreadsheet guy so i don't have the concrete proof of how many pennies i lost, but this seems like a pretty minor annoyance at best


[24-Apr-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BLooo**:	it was only down for an hour because we fed it though haha


[24-Apr-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	what kind of capitalists are we here, wringing our hands cause the workers dare demand RATs and MCG! hehe, yes theres no way we'd have all sat around and waited


[24-Apr-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Also @TheEnvoy when are you going to compensate us peasants for the contributions we made to the CoGC upkeep?


[24-Apr-23 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you're either:


[24-Apr-23 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	1) online but ignoring us


[24-Apr-23 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	problem : I'm basic


[24-Apr-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	129x DW, 185x RAT, 1x MCG, 552x PE (both this and last contribution cycle combined)

**DogeConomy**:	(as the almighty governor types his speech)


[24-Apr-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	@DogeConomy - I have reduced my PrUn playing to just maintaining Danakil. It seems you have a clear opinion of me at this point, so I wont go out of my way to change it. However, I will continue burning my mountain of cash supporting Danakil so long as the planet continues voting for me.


[24-Apr-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	this doesn't make much sense at all


[24-Apr-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	why would you burn 8 bucks a month just to support danakil


[24-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I am not just supporting Danakil with that $8. That money goes towards the development of PrUn.


[24-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well I guess


[24-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	wait


[24-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Apr-23 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Happy to do it! I have been rather focused on snuffing out problems with the POPR that I seem to have forgotten to hit the COGC. Its good that there are players here willing to cover it when that happens.

**TheEnvoy**:	Heya Danakil! Another term gone, another term to run for. I hope to convince everyone I am still a viable candidate!


[01-Jun-23 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	That being said, I am going to start looking for bulk orders of POPI materials for those who are interested in them. My approach will be to place a number of ads with a competitive price and a long fulfillment time. If anyone is interested, merely grab a contract of your choosing. The long contract time will allow for 2-3 weeks to fulfill.


[01-Jun-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	It also seems like we have added a fair amount of engineering jobs to the planet. I suspect this will take a few POPRs to resolve. If anyone is planning to add a large portion of engineers to the planet, I would like to request a heads up so I can plan ahead of time.


[01-Jun-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Ads posted for VIT, GL, SUN, STR, and TUB. I will assess what we need each week and post more ads. Please only accept ads that are intended to be fulfilled. Thank you!

**cubblakistan**:	welcome


[09-Jul-23 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	with this, I can finally get my own Afab production online, as well as set up my permernat Rfab line (current one is temporary, and taking space in a base I would really like to use for something else)


[09-Jul-23 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though it will have to wait a day or so, as I bring in the supplies nessary to actually run all the lines, this trip only brought the prefabs needed for the core module, housing (and STO), and production lines, none for inputs for higher tier fabs, and the ship also brought consumables for each tier, and only some inputs, but not enough at each tier to actually set up every line

[12-Jul-23 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	sure thing, I only plan to run 2 PP4 and 4 PP3, that way I can run enough PP1 and PP2 to have almost all of product from them go as inputs for higher tier fabs


[12-Jul-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Jets0n**:	Consumable supplies at Base - Moon are running low.


[21-Aug-23 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	what are those supplies?


[21-Aug-23 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	worker consumables, RAT, DW, OVE, COF, PWO, note, it won't complain about luxury ones if you never supplied them, but it will do so when you start to run low


[21-Aug-23 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	Thanks


[21-Aug-23 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it sends out a warning when you have less than 3 days worth at current consumption, note that if it consumes less than 1 unit per day it'll flag it at 3 left (even if you only consume 0.1 per day (happens on higher tier workers fairly often, mostly since you usually don't have a lot of them in a base))


[21-Aug-23 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I should also add, it works for all worker tiers, I only listed the pioneer tier stuff since your new, but realized that could be misleading for you later on, but those are the only ones you need to worry about for now


[21-Aug-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	is PPA considered as a consumable as well or i should better buy RATs instead of producing PPA?


[21-Aug-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	do they consume H2o or it must be DW?


[21-Aug-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	PPA is not a consumable, you can open you base screen, and click the workforce tab to see what your daily demand is for each item


[21-Aug-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	PPA is very unprofitable in the long run


[21-Aug-23 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	DW is drinking water, it's made from H2O though, but they are separate items and H2O can't be used in it's place, think of H2O as straight out of the ground from an unclean water source, while DW has been through a purification plant to bring it up to standand


[21-Aug-23 04:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	There's little demand for PPA, and one/ two food processors in the whole of the Moria region could satisfy the market demand

**bazdakka**:	each higher tier of worker requires more and more difficult to make consumables, and luzury consumables often require some input from a higher tier worker to make (exception, scientists, the highest tier of worker)


[21-Aug-23 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	also that, PPA is a bit of a newbie trap unfortunately, due to how the list is ordered


[21-Aug-23 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you started as a Vitualler start, your best bet is to make RAT, short for basic rations


[21-Aug-23 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	so i should produce some basic stuff like DW a lot to sell them, to buy constructiong materials to start digging minerals and construct the advanced buildings?


[21-Aug-23 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to look up any of the item or building codes we use, open a new buffer, and use either the MAT or BUI commands, followed by the item code, eg MAT RAT to look up what item or building we are talking about


[21-Aug-23 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the game is largely about trading, early on in particular, your best off specializing, and just making things your starting pack leans towards, since you can make more selling that that you will save making everything for yourself


[21-Aug-23 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	later on, when you have more bases, you can spread yourself out more


[21-Aug-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	for RAT i should build 3 facilities that produce all the components at once. kinda overwhelming for start. gota check the consumption of consumables, maybe i dont need THAT much DW and RAT after all


[21-Aug-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	don't grow crops using farms on danakil, it has negative fertility


[21-Aug-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	what pack did you start with out of interest


[21-Aug-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	probs carbon farmer


[21-Aug-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	click the "HELP" button on the top right to see


[21-Aug-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	i dont know how to chec. got some SCREENS and windows to remember and understand ^^


[21-Aug-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	on the buffer that pops up, under building recommendations


[21-Aug-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the fact he was asking about PPA makes me think Vitualler


[21-Aug-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	"help" button top right


[21-Aug-23 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	Victualler


[21-Aug-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	called it

[21-Aug-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no


[21-Aug-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you're in the middle of a price spike for food


[21-Aug-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-23 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-23 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	they used to be 80 at the start of the year


[21-Aug-23 04:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hortus was ~90 until recently


[21-Aug-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	my ship is at the Moria Station (Moria) deciding to load some more RAT, yesterday bought one for 151 i think


[21-Aug-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	giving he's only 2 days in, resetting now and choosing a planet with higher bias towards the Vitculler start would allow for a rocket start, plus, more people on the planet in question doing the same thing as you and able to answer your questions


[21-Aug-23 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	ty for the chart!


[21-Aug-23 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Verdant would be a better planet to start on for food production


[21-Aug-23 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not mine, I just keep the link, before you reset, take some time to look at why each planet has the rating the chart says it does


[21-Aug-23 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(promitor is best, but in another region so I can't help you there, at least not directly)


[21-Aug-23 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you want to challenge yourself go ahead


[21-Aug-23 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	so yeah, i guess ill start fresh, later ill transfer these money to the new planet


[21-Aug-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can't transfer money between runs


[21-Aug-23 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	at least not directly xd


[21-Aug-23 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm also on Promitor, so if you do reset there, I'll still be able to help on the planet chat, or you can ask in global and help channels, people tend to answer questions asked in those channels fairly quickly (a lot of us long term players have this open in the background and check back every half hour or so)


[21-Aug-23 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the command to reset is COLIQ , just enter it into a new buffer, it's a complete reset of your game, used for exactly cases like this


[21-Aug-23 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is a cool down on how often you can use it, but the devs made it easy to access for a reason


[21-Aug-23 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	btw isnt Verdant far away from the market hub?


[21-Aug-23 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	this game is deep, and it's easy to make a mistake like this, and resetting at least once is fairly common


[21-Aug-23 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes, it's a downside to that planet


[21-Aug-23 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Jets0n verdant is far away but there's a huge H2O/O deposit


[21-Aug-23 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so extracting water would be quicker


[21-Aug-23 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just something to keep in mind


[21-Aug-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	so ill be self sufficient there you mean?>


[21-Aug-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	ON THE START


[21-Aug-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and positive fertility, so it's also a good planet to do a Vituallar start on


[21-Aug-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah basically


[21-Aug-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but promitor's more popular ;)


[21-Aug-23 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not completely, but better than here, you still need to buy OVE in, and neither will let you make prebads for construction easily, but you can just buy those


[21-Aug-23 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Overalls are easy to make


[21-Aug-23 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just build a BMP once you've saved enough money


[21-Aug-23 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	as a Vituallar, your starting plan is make DW and RAT, keep just enough for yourself, sell the rest, you the money you make to buy prefabs and OVE


[21-Aug-23 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	are OVE better than RAT which means no dropping satisfaction?


[21-Aug-23 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	at the moment, RAT is particullar profitable, so I'd even skip making DW except just enough for yourself


[21-Aug-23 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	gotcha


[21-Aug-23 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you need 5 consumables to reach 100% satisfaction


[21-Aug-23 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	RAT, DW, OVE, PWO, COF


[21-Aug-23 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	5 types per day


[21-Aug-23 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	oh i see, available


[21-Aug-23 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	you need RAT, DW and OVE to keep your workers happy, a VItualler can make 2 of them easily himself, the 3rd isn't hard to make, but you can usually make more money just selling more RAT and DW, and buying OVE


[21-Aug-23 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same goes with COF and PWO


[21-Aug-23 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	DW and rat make up most of the satisfaction


[21-Aug-23 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	~43.33%


[21-Aug-23 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jets0n**:	thank you guys. going to COLIQ and looking forward trading with you later ^^


[21-Aug-23 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-23 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Aug-23 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	well, anyhow, putting my another poor attempt of humor aside. IF the worst case scenario will come true and we end up needing a new governor around here, I'm ready to give monetary support for anyone stepping in, as having healthy and steadily growing populace of engineers in this planet is vital for my growth as well : P

[22-Aug-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Aug-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Aug-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	Ye don't get me wrong, I wasn't on a campaign to de-throne you :). There just been a trend of established governors suddenly and without a word to leave their position, so as craftsman put it, I got bit spooked :)

**DogeConomy**:	Who does rfabs here I might have a potential customer (I'll be the middleman and will pay 5k extra on my end for you (on top of the buyer's payment) to do this)


[05-Sep-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I do small amouns - I am sure there are better suppliers (I keep running out of EPO)


[05-Sep-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	fucking EPO and PG


[05-Sep-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daegon616**:	I make rfabs


[05-Sep-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nullus**:	^ same. small amounts, EPO and RG hard to keep in supply :)


[05-Sep-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	i built 22 POLs and still buying PG/EPO on the cx


[05-Sep-23 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I put a base on OT-889c :: 3xEXT -> 7xCHP -> 10xPOL :: should gross 4,900 EPO a week once it is finished - and it still won't be enough

**Soldaros**:	To anyone here who can hear my pleas: I done f-ed up on a recent trade run, and I'm *20 hecking MCG* short of what I need. Got an ad posted in the LM if anyone feels like bailing me out...

[06-Sep-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Soldaros**:	Oh, I remembered it alright, the ammount I bought was calculated... but damn am I bad at math xD

**kiwiflyer**:	Is anyone ale to sell be some OVE on the LM (I only need 10)? Happy to pay a preimum - my ships are quite some way away from base at the moment and I have somewhat miscalculated. Thanks


[07-Sep-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Heya Danakil! I have upgraded a few buildings and we are seeing much better results in the growth in the POPR. I am considering stepping back from PrUn so I am probing if there is interest in an election. I will gladly pass off the corp, POPI/COGC materials, and a decent sized pile of NCC to my successor.


[07-Sep-23 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	is Danakil set up near break even for the governer?


[07-Sep-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@TheEnvoy has told us before that they sacrifice a portion of their income onto this planet


[07-Sep-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(I may be wrong though or remembered incorrectly)


[07-Sep-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	Danakil is ~150k pop  about 1/3 that of Montem


[07-Sep-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I would estimate that it costs me ~100k a week to keep the planet running.


[07-Sep-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I have been slowly burning down a mountain of cash, the POPI purchases were not tracked well.


[07-Sep-23 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cubblakistan**:	if you're really looking to get out i'd run. this is a good planet, i'm sure theres a couple people here who would run just to not see it get neglected

[03-Oct-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	A quick financial report from the Governor.  Revenues from the verious fees looks to be averaging 45k NCC every day.  Expenditures to fund all the programs average out to 80k per day.  I'm working on the spreadsheets to narrow that gap, while still managing the population.


[03-Oct-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DarkKing**:	No tax increases this term, I'll cover the shortfall from my own account.  If I do decide to change the tax rates, I will announce it well in advance of the next election, so everyone can have a voice on the matter.  If anyone has any questions or input, please reach out to me here or DM.

**DarkKing**:	Financial Report: Income from taxes was up, 455k for last week.  Expenses are up to 805k last week at MSRP.  I'm setting up production to get most of the supplies cheaper (GL/OFF/PFE).  Good News - TheEnvoy made a very large donation to cover any shortfall for at least 3 months.     Everything will be covered with no tax increase.

[18-Oct-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sebito**:	It makes sense to wait until production is ready before i send out a cargo ship to resupply right? This way i can also sell any produce that is done.


[18-Oct-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yea I typically make the most of my trips. An empty ship is a ship not making money, usually


[18-Oct-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	@vattaiCS - it is pretty overwhelming, but do the demos, ask questions and poke through the material online - basic idea is you have a "base" on the planet, your "buildings" turn one material into another (like H2O -> DW) you need "consumables" for your workers to consume, then sell the finished materials for profit.


[01-Nov-23 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Then it gets complicated


[01-Nov-23 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vattaiCS**:	Will do. Also I think I do a startover because this planet is not good for farming/material gathering nor fuel extraction.

I do, however, have a promise. A promise for all who reside on Danakil. Free bread. Thats right, this election cycle, a vote for S3KT355, is a vote for a free bread emoji, sent to you via discord. So this election cycle, vote S3KT355; because we all deserve that bread.

**S3KT355**:	@flakboy thats a good question. I asked my team beforehand about the impact this campaign promise would have on the bread emoji market and they've reassured me that, while yes, the demand for bread emojis will go up, since the demand will be fulfilled by government contractors, the inflation can be controlled through either tax incentives for suppliers in exchange for preference on future contracts, or through legislation and the treasury department; and no, it will certainly not damage your dreams of owning a MINT 1981 Ferrari 308 GTSi, if anything, I believe your government funded bread emojis will make it easier to attain since that will be at least one less bread emoji you have to produce

I know there are a lot of newer players stationed on Danakil, myself included, so i would like inform you of how you, yes you, can get involved in the political process; regardless of who you vote for. To vote, simple open your planet info for Danakil, or type "PLI OT-442b" into a new buffer, then scroll down and click the link for the planetary administration center, then simply click vote on the candidate you want to win. And I would like to give a huge thanks to @flakboy and @craftsmanThirteen for their challenging and engaging questions about my campaign. Regardless of who wins, there will be bread for all of want. Thank you and please remember to vote.

**S3KT355**:	My fellow Danakilians, it has come to my attention that there are concerns about my opponent's activity in game and I would like to take this opportunity to give you all a reassurance about my own activity. I recently quit playing my main game because of new hardware requirements and have now dedicated, at least for the time being, to having PrUn being my main game. So far, it fits very nicely into my IRL schedule and I think it's a really nice game to play in the little time I have left in my busy schedule. Over the course of this campaign, I have taken the time to understand a lot more about the game than when I first started and I now have a new campaign promise for the people; to improve working conditions for the workforce and attract more companies to build bases. If you have anymore questions about my plan as governor, please, ping me, or send me a message me on discord.


[15-Dec-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	As governor, my inbox will always be open, so for those interested with comments or concerns, my discord is "sektess", and i will get to your messages as soon as possible. Thank you for your support in this race to all who voted for me so far and I hope we can all improve our profits in the coming future.


[15-Dec-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daegon616**:	are you going to pay for all of the upkeep? and taxes go to the corporation of the gov not the gov themselves so is the whole GTU going to pay the upkeep from the dividends?

**S3KT355**:	@daegon616 if elected, i would be leaving the GTU and forming a corporation specifically to collect taxes generated on danakil so that i will be able to properly distribute them into upkeeps. Myself and a few of my contacts will be actively working to both make sure upkeeps are taken care of and improvements can come. Of course, it is a large task to keep up with an entire planet's worth of infrastructure so it will be a community driving project in the coming future so that even if i'm voted out of office in a future election cycle, we won't have to worry about the CoGC going on strike again. My goal is not to just babysit the planet with my own funds, but rather to help build a system that works for everyone with a presence here. With that type of assurance, we can focus on growing the planet's economic attractiveness and make it one of the best planets to have a base on.

[16-Dec-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I have one question regarding the voting, given Danakil is a highly developed planet, with a lot of high tier workers, this means a large amount of population infrastructure upkeep is required. This is a costly requirement for a governor (especially since a lot of governors seem to not mind running at a lose, though I disagree with that myself), and as a new player, how well do you think you'll be able to provide the large amount of materials needed for population infrastructure upkeep?


[16-Dec-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I imagine as a member of GTU, you'll be able to get help for this easily, but I'd like to confirm that you are at least aware of the possible problem


[16-Dec-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	@bazdakka i have been made aware of this by other members of GTU, and it is definitely going to be a challenge, but i also disagree with this type of system and i hope to shift us into something that is more sustainable and doesn't make the governor's office just be a planetary babysitting role. To this extent, i've made a discord server for anyone on danakil to join and help keep all of us up to date on upkeep and plans for improving infrastructure in the future. I want to be clear about this and assure everyone that this isn't just going to be a "while i'm in office" server, but rather, even if i'm voted out in the future, i want all of us to be able to use this server for making sure things are kept up to date and business runs as smoothly as possible for everyone. For those interested, here is the link: https://discord.gg/ruUHDyGRAB , and please message me personally if you have any other questions or suggestions about it.


[16-Dec-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	i want this discord server, and this planet, to thrive as the game continues to grow and i'm not gonna stop working on it, even if i'm not voted into office at all

**bazdakka**:	part of the reason the governor system exists is because in a previous universe, without this system, if a player spent the cash to develop a planet, a second could land, refuse to assist in running the planet, and force the first player to pay the population infrastructure of both of them. the governor system gets around this by allowing us to vote for a player to be responsible for this. It's a large part of what the taxes are meant to be used for


[17-Dec-23 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	most governor tend to run planets at a lose, something I disagree with, I have no problems with the governor making a small profit for governing the planet, as thanks for the effort needed to actually govern the planet


[17-Dec-23 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but with such an advance planet, the costs of running it will be quite high, and while hopefully the taxes are enough to run the planet, you'll need to wait for the first batch of taxes to come in to do so

I would much rather see these POPR numbers move in a positive direction.

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	FYI - all of the upkeep materials you put into the Wildlife Park and Art Cafe will be wasted unless you put more upkeep into the Safety Station and Infirmary.   Need fulfillment for Comfort/Culture/Education is limited by Safety/Health.  i.e. if Safety is at 30% then Comfort will not go above 30% no matter how much upkeep you put into it.

**S3KT355**:	That sounds like a great suggestion actually, i'll look into adjusting into next week with the propper supplies and shutting down some of the SST and INF, my governor helper is showing 65.94% saftey, 95.32% health, 36.49% comfort, 33.67% culture with DW filled on SST, STR filled on INF, DW on PAR and VIT DW and GL filled on ACA


[30-Dec-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	although i feel like those percentages may be a bit excessive for a 10% unemployment target accross the board, still gonna need some more adjusting after the next POPR comes out, i'm hoping with the current upkeeps filled and the end of the education campaign there will be enough ENGI to fill the open jobs and let us comfortably transition back into festivities III


[30-Dec-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	@vasyklo , i'm currently looking into some type of rebate program that can be done to help get more people producing upkeep mats on planet, or delivering them here, message me on discord @sektess and we can sort out the details about you getting compensated for the mats.

[30-Dec-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	If you're using Archiel's Governor Helper double check the base count is set correctly. For Danakil base count is 155 (494 total plots - 333 available plots - 6 planet infra projects). The previous governor ran into this problem and made it look like Safety / Health would be higher than reality


[30-Dec-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	My suggestion above gives approx 45% Safety, 46% Health, 45% Comfort, and 19% Culture


[30-Dec-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	Festivities III will be more effective than Advanced Education III until need fulfillment is much higher. Getting happiness >50% will eliminate out migration and each percentage of happiness will also help the education rate. For example, compare POPR #143 from a few weeks ago to POPR #147 the most recent

[09-Jan-24 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	agreed, don't be afraid to ask, I just point out that the FAQ is a very good resource, answers a lot of the most common questions (I was around before it was finished, when it only answered a few of the most basic things


[09-Jan-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	*grandpa Simpson voice* 'back in my day' I remember the same questions were asked in general and help channels every couple of days (and that is just the time I was online), after it was finished, it dropped to about a tenth of what they were (and often someone could just link the FAQ to answer it).


[09-Jan-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that and learning to research some stuff is really useful in this game, early on, just do what the game recommends, the starter paths are all viable paths (some are more difficult than others), but after a couple of months, as your expanding, learning how to find out if something is a good idea for yourself is a very useful skill to have


[09-Jan-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	expanding to a second planet (40 days is very quick, anything up to 120 days is normal) is one of the hardest things for new players to do, and requires putting everything you've learned to the test (it is what breaks a lot of new players)


[09-Jan-24 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	technically any time you expand to a new base is hard, it's just the first time is the hardest because to amount of me (or any other veteran player) telling you how hard it is will prepare you for it


[09-Jan-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	^ I absolutely agree. My second base was very early on but made it strictly pioneers to help the transition. I also hope any new players here ask questions they dont see on the FAQ


[09-Jan-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jan-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	population report, it's a 1 week time peroid, I forget when, but it's either monday to monday, or sunday to sunday


[10-Jan-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	during the report, work forces are rebalanced, as each planet only has so many workers, most of the time, especially early on, this won't matter, as all starter planets, and most common expansion, have enough workers, at least at the lower tier of worker, that you won't hit the limit


[10-Jan-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	*more advance player lesson coming up* to maintain planet populations, governors are elected, and it's what the tax on production runs goes towards paying for (as such, existing governors get one hell of an advantage over new runners, as a bad governor can shut a planet down for a month), either through buying or paying for the production of population infrastructure items and upgrading the infrastructure in general, as well as paying for CoCG (chamber of global commerce) upkeep


[10-Jan-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

**S3KT355**:	@yourfavoritemike while the POPI upkeep and the specifics of governing don't affect you per say, you do still get the ability to vote for who is governor. if you're looking at the PLI for danakil (which should be a part of your starter HQ screen), you'll see a hyperlink under infrastructure called the planetary administration center. if you click that, you'll see the upcoming term and next to the candidates are two greyed out vote buttons. when the election starts, you'll get one vote that you can commit to whichever candidate you want. even if you don't understand much about the governor's race or keeping up with a planet, i highly encourage you to still at least get involved in the voting process and voice any opinions you may have about how the planet is being run or what you think should change, because otherwise we won't know how to fix the problems you're having :D

**bazdakka**:	why I flagged it as a more advance player lesson, there is a lot that goes into running a planet, from goverment programs, taxes on each type of building, population infrastructure (and figuring out the most cost effective way to maintain required population for each workforce tier). most existing major planets have figured out the answer to these questions, but it's also why when 2 people run for governor, the existing one will win 90% of the time, as I said above, a bad governor can shut a planet down for a month (via maxing out taxes to insane levels, and not maintaining any of the population infrastructure). That being said, sometimes a governor retires, ie, doesn't run again and we have to choose a new one, or has something happen that means he can't do his job properly and majorly effects the planets usefulness, in which case a new governor can take over for someone not doing their job properly


[10-Jan-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	all starter planets have a healthy excess of low tier populations, as well as most common expansions from said starter planets (I won't say all because there might be 1 that is the exception), more advance planets might still have problems with that, but planets that favor high tier populations for whatever reasons will still have this problem (this is more mid to late game though). The reason is that high tier populations are rather expensive to maintain for a governor, so they try and run as little excess as possible


[10-Jan-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	basically, you won't need this knowledge for at least a couple of months, but it's worth paying attention to when discussions about it happen in chat, this planet is actually a really good one for it due to the current higher tier population shortages on this planet, so there will be discussions about it in this chat


[10-Jan-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Speaking of which, the next election starts in 17hrs.  Remember, vote early and vote often.


[10-Jan-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I'm going to wait for the next pop report on the planet before voting (I think slightly before the vote begins anyway) to see what's happening, because this large shortage of higher tier populations takes a lot to fix


[10-Jan-24 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YourFavoriteMike**:	Thank you everyone for the information.  I will definitely be checking it out!


[11-Jan-24 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	well i'd just like to say that the good news is we've stemmed the outward migration of techs and engis, however the open jobs has gone up so do agree that theres been some extra bases added to the planet, i'm gonna be putting more upkeep materials on order to get the happiness up more so we can get those jobs filled. i like that the unemployment is going down with pio and setts, so hopefully we can keep this trend going in the direction that we want it. i think we've done a good job dealing with this problem so far and i'd like to thank everyone that contributed to the POPI upkeeps to help stem the issue


[11-Jan-24 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	As for the election, i am indeed running for governor again, and i'd like to ammend my campaign promises. I will still provide a free bread emoji to any Danakilian at request, however, i would also like to add that should i be reelected as governor, i fully intend to keep pushing the issue with population management that we've currently been dealing with and make sure that should something like this happen again, there is a readily available stockpile of materials that will help readjust the population to where it should be. So remember, no matter who you vote for, I'll always be fighting for your bread, and your bases.

**bazdakka**:	hmm, looks like some upgrades might be needed, those are expensive, though short term supplying more materials will do, I'd suggest something that does safety, since higher tier concerns are capped by lower tier ones (tier one is life support, tier 2 is safety and health, tier 3 is comfort and culture, tier 4 is education), ie, the highest a tier can go is the lower of the ones for the previous tier, in out case, comfort and culture can't be raised higher than our safety (current lowest of safety and health), so to raise them, we need to raise safety first, and health not long after, both the easy buildings have been upgraded to level 10 already (rather expensive, but this is the right planet for it), but it may be worth looking at getting other buildings, or just accepting that we need to supply 2 upkeep materials permanently from now on


[17-Jan-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	higher tier pops like what this planet has a shortage of do benefit more from comfort and culture though


[17-Jan-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Good point about the safety and health. I forgot that detail.


[17-Jan-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's not one that comes up often, only when your trying to really pump up the levels of comfort and culture to increase migration while also running programs at the same time (usually your only doing 1 at a time)


[17-Jan-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but in a case like what I'm seeing on the pop report, doing both, while expensive, might be worth it to fix the short term problem, might be worth it, I can't actually be bothered to do the math


[17-Jan-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to help, I donated some DW to the safetly station, as it's the only mat I have on the planet that might help, and it is the current limit, so if others want to help out short term, some spare DW into that would do (the amount needed to fill it up is more than I suspect anyone is storing on a base here

**S3KT355**:	well the new POPR looks better, we've got migration on technicians and education for techs, so the defecit is definitely thinning, i think if we keep up with the upkeeps and possibly add a lil bit more supplies to the SST we should be able to almost have the open jobs covered by the next POPR


[18-Jan-24 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I only just filled in the SST about half a day before the population report... it hasn't quite kicked in yet. Next week it should look much better overall.


[18-Jan-24 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I haven't looked at the spreadsheets to see where we'll land but my gut tells me we could leave the SST as-is and be okay. It's running at level 10 so even at 67% it's probably fine for a planet this size. In fact the risk is we may attract too many PIO which will dilute the effect of the higher tiers.


[18-Jan-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	that's ok, if it gets to be back above 20% unemployment with PIO then i'll switch the next campaign to be education and it should push out some of the PIO both through migration and education


[18-Jan-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	i.e too many PIO will take away the compfort and culture frmo the population that really need it


[18-Jan-24 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	it's def a balancing act, but i think we've got it handled, especially with how good these last 2 POPRs looked


[18-Jan-24 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	next one should be much better I think


[18-Jan-24 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	just checked a few things: I think we will get about 600 new technicians and 55 new engineers next week.


[18-Jan-24 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	we'll need to bost education to get more engineers - we've stopped the outward migration, so now education is how to get more.


[18-Jan-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	or we could run the engineer immigration program


[18-Jan-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	we'd have to build more POPI to get the education, and in the long run that will be good, especially if more people build bases and need the higher teir pops, the problem is doing it in the short term, and i've already queued up the festivities so i can't cancel it. I'd like to get the library started so we can at least have some type of education. i'll see about getting the materials brought here to build it, but if anyone would like to contribute it would be very appreciated and i am willing to buy the materials planetside at -10% MOR price


[18-Jan-24 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	i would like to add that i only want to build a single LIB for the time being, since education is going to be on an as needed basis, i don't want to over invest on something that possibly won't be used very often. so please keep that in mind if you do decide to help contribute to the upgrade/upkeep

**bazdakka**:	I think he means the education government program, not the education need, the education need is mostly to make scientists happy, and given what this planet is used for, I don't think many people would plan to build things that need them here (there is no building that is in the construction field that uses scientists)


[18-Jan-24 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the gov program however encourages existing populations to move up tiers, and is a good way to bleed off lower tier workers if there is to many of them but not enough higher tier ones as it lowers overall happiness (your not running festivities instead) and moves them into higher tiers, which you might be wanting anyway

[18-Jan-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**S3KT355**:	for those who haven't checked yet, the new POPR is out and we are looking to be a lot better than the last POPR. Open jobs in TECH have been filled and unemployment is now up to 2.5%, and open jobs for ENG are down to 196. accounting for all of the newcomers to the planet, i beleive we are going to be just fine and should let the POPI run through most of whats left on their upkeeps and start shifting to minimizing what's put into upkeep to save on resources


[25-Jan-24 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	That being said, i would like to let the SST and INF completely run through their upkeep reserves and keep DW and FOD in the PAR and DW and COF in the ACA filled until the SST and INF are drained, that way we don't overdo it on PIO and SET unemployment and give ourselves an entirely different problem than the one we had before i took office


[25-Jan-24 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	once the SST and INF run through what they have, i want to shift to keeping them filled with just SUN in the SST and TUB in the INF to keep the 10 day cycles going for them so we don't start losing POP again.


[25-Jan-24 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	until we see a large defecit in POP on the POPR, i don't want to keep satisfaction so high that immigration becomes a problem


[25-Jan-24 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	That's good. Interesting that the technicians increased so much... I thought it might bump up by about 600 but we instead got almost 2500, mostly throught immigration.


[25-Jan-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I think it might take 1 or 2 more weeks to get all the engineers, assuming everything else stays the same.


[25-Jan-24 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Keep in mind that higher tiers still need safety and health, though at a lower rate. Letting SST and INF run dry will also impact the higher tiers


[25-Jan-24 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	btw the POPR shows open jobs before the population change is calculated, so all technician jobs were already filled last week and engineer jobs are almost filled now


[25-Jan-24 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	Advanced Education III next week will cut the migration of lower tiers (by displacing Festivities III) and double the rate of engineers


[25-Jan-24 01:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	If Party field near the objective is empty than yes. Otherwise, this means you have to produce 20 units of water and when you're ready click a Fulfil button

**dontwork**:	I already have that much water, do I still need to produce it? How do you make water?


[28-Jan-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	You can fulfill the objective if you already possess the required amount. On Danakil, water is produced by Rigs. This may vary depending on the surface temperature; for instance, ice is collected by extractors, etc.


[28-Jan-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	The fulfil button is greyed out. all conditions after the first say they depend on #1, so do I need to wait 15 hours for my production order to complete first?


[28-Jan-24 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	If the 'Fulfill' button is grayed out, it means you haven't reached the objective and/or the resource is not in the Base Storage.

[28-Jan-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	I would recommend spending some time on the market to see what items are valuable and how many resources you would need to invest to start producing them. Note that you don't always need to produce every item in the production chain; you can also import from the market.


[28-Jan-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	How do you know which cx to look at?


[28-Jan-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	the closest one is in Moria


[28-Jan-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	NC1


[28-Jan-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Is there a well renowned beginners guide?


[28-Jan-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**dontwork**:	I've sent a ship to to moria


[28-Jan-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	good


[28-Jan-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	I dont have the resources to build a rig and it seems like a good thing to have


[28-Jan-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	So i'm hoping to buy those BSE and MCG there


[28-Jan-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	good idea


[28-Jan-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Do you use the mobile site?


[28-Jan-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	sometimes... it's not very convinient


[28-Jan-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	I wonder if my ship will make it to moria


[28-Jan-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	it will eventually


[28-Jan-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	just a matter of time


[28-Jan-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Just watching the fuel bar, goes down quick


[28-Jan-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	did you change fuel usage in flight plan?


[28-Jan-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	no but it was set to low I think


[28-Jan-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	then you should be alright


[28-Jan-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Is there anything I need to be worried about that could ruin my game?


[28-Jan-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	Poorly considered decisions.


[28-Jan-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Not sure I'll be making anything but those


[28-Jan-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	you'll catchup. it seems complicated at first but then it's a lot of fun


[28-Jan-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	How did you get into the swing of things? just persistence?


[28-Jan-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	planing, calculation.. a lot of calculations. it gets more intresting as your base grows


[28-Jan-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	@dontwork it takes time, and strategizing is a key part of getting used to this game, you've gotta be thinking at least a step ahead of yourself in what you're gonna do


[28-Jan-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	and it also helps to join a corporation so you've got people who are more experienced who can teach you what you need to know to grow


[28-Jan-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	When i try and open the WF command it says it's and illegal command


[28-Jan-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	you have to put the base that you're selecting after WF


[28-Jan-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	so for example it would be "WF OT.442b"


[28-Jan-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	wait that didn't work for me


[28-Jan-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Is there a way to see workforce without doing that?


[28-Jan-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	BS OT-442b


[28-Jan-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	type that into a buffer


[28-Jan-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	and you should see a button for your workforce


[28-Jan-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	OK so the worst thing I could have happen is running out of my essential resources i presume? So i should stock up on DW, RAT and OVE


[28-Jan-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	i would keep stock at least 15-20 days worth, which shouldn't be that much when you're first starting out


[28-Jan-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alex_Stark**:	apart from that consider importing COF and PWO if you want your workers to work at 100% efficiency


[28-Jan-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	If workforce resource usage is green, what does that mean?


[28-Jan-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	if it's green it means it's fulfilled


[28-Jan-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Often green represents going up, so I wasnt sure if i was somehow creating those resources


[28-Jan-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	if you look under the tab that says total in the workforce menu, it should display the total daily consumption, so you can calculate how much you would need for a buffer you want to keep


[28-Jan-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	and that total accounts for all types of workers consuming a single resource


[28-Jan-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dontwork**:	Right I need to go, thanks. Maybe see you again, maybe not - not much pull in this game :D

[03-Feb-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	You need to buy more supplies, nearly impossible to be fully self-sufficient right at the start, send a ship to your nearest CX station to buy stuff


[03-Feb-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	CX?


[03-Feb-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Commodity Exchange on the universe map, basically a marketplace where people buy and sell supplies and materials


[03-Feb-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	You should see them as hexagons on the map, there's a few of them


[03-Feb-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	so i can spend my free ships right at start? i got 2 ships and need rovv resourses

**babipoki**:	how much should i pay for shipping? whats the usual cost?


[20-Feb-24 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	does "10 NCC for higher value" mean if I have 450t/450m3 shipment, I pay 4500?


[20-Feb-24 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	think i understand now : D


[20-Feb-24 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	450t/100m³ you pay 4500. 100t/450m³ you pay 4500. 10 NCC for higher value


[20-Feb-24 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	aye


[20-Feb-24 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	is this a normal/usual rate for one-jump shipping?


[20-Feb-24 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	or even zero jump for this case


[20-Feb-24 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	wondering if there's a calculator for this


[20-Feb-24 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	Excel calculator?)) I think it's normal price if you need to ship little costly materials.


[20-Feb-24 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	hmm. so i've posted MOR-> Prism (2 jumps) thingy, 499.5t/185m3. It's Aluminum.  4995 NCC. Wondering if it's worth it...


[20-Feb-24 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	with my third base now i'm struggling to keep up a little bit


[20-Feb-24 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	It worth it while you can get profit


[20-Feb-24 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	guess FIO won't help me with it, i really dooo need a spreadsheet for this


[20-Feb-24 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	though at the same time, i can never know how will planets align to know exact fuel cost for me


[20-Feb-24 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	there's no way to check how much fuel will it cost for me to fly somewhere if my ships are currently in flight, right?


[20-Feb-24 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	ok, calculation done. definitely NOT worth it to transport AL by contract :D


[20-Feb-24 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	AL.NC1 or ALO.NC1?

**babipoki**:	i just hover over the thing D:


[20-Feb-24 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	AL.NC1


[20-Feb-24 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	Honestly, i expect it worth it.


[20-Feb-24 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	I make LHP.NC1 , FLP.NC1 and FC.NC1 with it, and it eats it faaast


[20-Feb-24 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	72.73/d according to FIO


[20-Feb-24 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	AL.NC1 + 30N CC (~3t) or 270 NCC for 10 AL not worth it? It's like +27 production cost


[20-Feb-24 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i mean if i ship it myself, it'll only cost me 2064 NCC one way


[20-Feb-24 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	4995 NCC with local market


[20-Feb-24 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	109 SF, 62 FF


[20-Feb-24 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	~14 hrs


[20-Feb-24 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i feel like i'm missing something from calculation :D


[20-Feb-24 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	Repair cost i guess


[20-Feb-24 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	and maybe my ships busy-ness, and time taken... think it'll be more relevant to use local market once i have more than 3 bases


[20-Feb-24 02:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You pay for shipping because you can't afford another ship. I don't know how to include that number but you should take that into account.


[20-Feb-24 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If everyone had the capacity to ship stuff themselves, there wouldn't be any LM shipping ads


[20-Feb-24 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	for sure i can probably keep up with my production right now, just wish Prun planner took shipping costs (own and LM) into profit somehow


[20-Feb-24 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	maybe i could use price override, so if i buy AL.NC1 at 649 and i can ship 185 pieces per route... that'll make AL price... uhh...


[20-Feb-24 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	660.16


[20-Feb-24 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	so i can just input that into price override and it should work


[20-Feb-24 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	okay, whew. everything still profitable


[20-Feb-24 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	I think it will be better to calculate transport expenses separately from production costs


[20-Feb-24 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Not_a_knight**:	So you can change them at any time

**Turin**:	Go to New BFR in the lower left hand corner and type in INV and hit enter. This will show you all of your inventories across the galaxy. Open your ships inventory (as long as it's landed on the planet) and the warehouse inventory, and drag the items from one to another

**S3KT355**:	@Neceros it's def a neiche game, but it is quite fun once it does get going. i also had the same issue when i started playing and i found out that this is actually the second time i've played this game but don't remember at all playing it ever. if you would like to give this game a good chance, i would highly reccommend looking to join a corporation with some more experienced players. it helped me when i joined GTU because there are a lot of vets there who are very eager to help others learn, and i'm sure there are even more corps that would love to help you out. you can also post any questions you have either here or in the APEX Help channel as there are an abundance of players who would be more than happy to help you out since we all benefit from the more people that decide to continue to play the game. this isn't necessarily a game that you can really spend a lot of time in, but it sticks around and is surprisingly fun once you start to getting into base expansions and CX trading

**S3KT355**:	Hello everyone, i just have a quick announcement. After this term i'll be resigning my position as governor. It's honestly been fun and i genuinely loved being governor of a planet for 4 consecutive terms now, but i want to shift my focus and grow Brilliant Blue Moon LLC into being the top fuel producing company in the game. I hope someone will be able to take the reigns and take good care of this planet that i've become so fond of, and i'd like to give a huge thanks to everyone, both in and out of GTU for your support. I would have never been able to win the governor's race, or even continue to stay in office had it not been for everyone that helped me along the way. Of course i'll still be sticking around on Danakil as this will always be my PRUN home, so if you need, just call :D

[10-Apr-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teky**:	cant imagine a game with 16h wait for the first product..


[10-Apr-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Unfortunately yeah, the game can be like that most of the time, though if you want more action you could try to make the orders smaller but shorter


[10-Apr-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Most of this game is really just planning, calculating etc. Pondering what would be your next move by the time x thing is ready or y ship arrives


[10-Apr-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teky**:	thats okay i guess, but is there another way to interact with it? phone app ? its just so unrewarding to just build 4 buildings and start 2 units of production just to wait for 16h


[10-Apr-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Welll as you start to gather more money you can expand your productions, make new things, and if you consider Pro you can do shipping contracts for little extra income


[10-Apr-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	But yeah the game is very slow in the beginning and takes time to get used to


[10-Apr-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Teky**:	guess im gonna send my ship to the next market and try to get some water atleast so i can be farming for longer than 10 products


[10-Apr-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Apr-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Kegman96**:	times can go down based on the planetary focus as well, here its construction I think so building PP1 to make BSE, BDE, BTA, and BBH are the most efficient at tier 1


[10-Apr-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Also, there isnt a phone app but you can open it in your mobile browser and you get a customizable menu to interact with

**AwonGardino**:	So, if im F2P i cant get access to local marcet on out planet?


[11-Apr-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**S3KT355**:	no, you have to at least bought one month of a pro liscense. after a pro liscense expires, you'll go to basic where you can accept player contracts and local market listings but you can't send or make them yourself


[11-Apr-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	You can use the CX at Moria as a F2P, its not far from Danakil.

[11-Apr-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I think someone just asked that in the global chat, but its not too important (I totally forget what it is) - but I think it has to do with how many new workers you got at the last population report


[11-Apr-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The LM and WAR fees are at the minimum the game allows for a faction space planet.  I may adjust the taxes once I get more data.  The first dividend payout only covered my first 2 days in office.  Worked out to about 30k/day (about 200/day per base).  COGC upkeep and Festivities program takes 1/3 of that.  Most of the rest goes to POPI upkeep with some set aside for POPI upgrades.  Even at current levels taxes take less than 3% of your profits.

[17-Apr-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Yeah for faction space this place is fine imo, its my 4th base though so the fees are just kind of lost in the pile of receipts tbh


[17-Apr-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Don't worry when you hit 18 planets you won't even bother looking at them,  Just how many A-fabs were built this week.


[17-Apr-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TeurasSika**:	Can I ask, what's the idea behind this planet?


[04-May-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	First I thought htat constru bonus next to Moria cx is great for selling prefabs there, but I'm quickly realizing that importing all those metals is eating my cargo capacity way too quickly


[04-May-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Construction, where components are imported to the planet, only good thing I can think of :P Also, torilla tavataan


[04-May-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	:DD


[04-May-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	And honestly it's exactly the same reason I started here, proximity to CX, but yeah I'm struggling with same thing, metals are heavy


[04-May-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	darn


[04-May-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Definitely moving my focus onto expanding to elsewhere, while a starting planet with symbolic value to me, still pretty annoying to work with


[04-May-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I offer cheaper WCB upgrades for newer players if you are planning for that


[04-May-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	I was hoping there would've been some big corp scheme where they import tons of metals here for internal markets i could get in somehow :DD


[04-May-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	I will when I'm able to afford that, got couple loans and third base project I'll have to focus on for now


[04-May-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	I mean that definitely is a thing :)


[04-May-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	what's a WCB upgrade, does it increase cargo on my ships? How much? :D


[04-May-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Increases max volume to 1000m3 and max weight to 3000 tons


[04-May-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	ooo ...sounds expensive tho :D


[04-May-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Somewhat but the sale is definitely worth it


[04-May-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	how much in the ballpark?


[04-May-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	UFO discord server has the exact prices, lemme check real quick


[04-May-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Schaitr offers WCB + LFE at 470k


[04-May-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	oh that's actually not at all bad, especially if there's a discount for new players


[04-May-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	I mean, I wont need it for month(s) probably, but good to know that's an option


[04-May-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Yeah the offer is open for all players who have played <180 days


[04-May-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	I started only ~2weeks ago and have just got to ~100k revenue, what do you think, should I stick to my guns here or COLIQ for greener pastures? :DD


[04-May-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Honestly not a bad start at all imo, might as well go with it c:


[04-May-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	kk thanks :D Considering theres the option to upgrade cargo capacity by half mil WCP I think I could make this work


[04-May-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Oh_leperchaun**:	if your thinking of smelting it would be a good idea to get a bases on another planet with the ore you need and just ship C and O to it every week to keep up the supply but that will cost about 125k-150k just to buy all the parts for the base and consumables


[06-May-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Oh_leperchaun**:	i started as smelting then they jacked the C price up so i had to make a base here now i have a surpluses of C and O  with my base with 2 farms 1 water 1 oxygen 1 burner with 3 pioneer habs i need to get 2 more farms so i can get all the crops i need to do the fast burning

[20-May-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The number of open jobs shown on last POPR is BEFORE the addition of new TECs, so we're not short unless someone plopped a TEC base down since that POPR


[20-May-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, that's probably the case then, because I got 46/80 (apparently, it happened after I've built my second PP3)

**TeurasSika**:	so wait even when we have tech unemployment 0%, if I were to build PP3 now technicians would come to fill it at next POPR?


[21-May-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Not necessarily, especially since there's 93 open jobs, jobs that haven't been filled with technicians


[21-May-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snowfzy**:	Dunno the exact mechanic for this kind of situation


[21-May-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	The [open jobs] number refers to jobs waiting to be filled before the last POPR ran.  The [change] number shows the number of workers that were added on that last POPR.    Since there were 93 open jobs and a change of 152 all those jobs were filled and there were 59 unemployed workers afterwards.  The unemployed workers go into the planetary pool and each base can take up to 10% from that pool during the week.  When the next POPR runs any remaining unemployed workers will be distributed.


[21-May-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	So if you now build a PP3 which requires 40 technicians you will get 6 (rounded up from 5.9) workers... assuming 10 other people haven't already built stuff that used up all 59 unemployed workers.  When the next POPR runs if there are enough available workers then you will get the remaining 34 that you need.


[21-May-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TeurasSika**:	I see, thanks for spelling the mechanic out for me! So to cut to the chase, I'm guessing if I were to construct PP3(s) I could maybe expect to fill them with technicians in a couple of weeks (with the current status of Danakil)? :D

**stosXri**:	yeah ofc food planet, the menu is full of BSE and BBH :P


[31-May-24 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	The planet does have a fertility rating, so you can use a FRM/ORC on it - but the fertility is pretty bad so if people want to grow they go to Verdant - instead most people run PP1/2/3/4 here and the COGC is Construction.


[31-May-24 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jarcon**:	Hi o/ noob here - is there a local market you can buy stuff on-planet (simple example: water)?


[31-May-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	There is a local market, but it is limited to what other players want to see, and I believe you would need a PRO or Basic account to use it - otherwise you need to fly to Moria Station which is the commodity exchange where you can buy nearly everything.


[31-May-24 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	The fertility is not great, but it is high enough to be economically viable.


[31-May-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, but I just put my farms on Verdant :-)


[31-May-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pfeifenson**:	Was my first planet to try out farming, looks like it was a bad idea


[31-May-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, probably not that bad, considering it's relative close to Moria


[31-May-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	But yeah, I've moved my farms to Verdant too :D


[31-May-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I started farming on Montem - so it is not a lost cause - and I did have a FRM here in the past - just keep playing and you can learn and grow - and also COLIQ which gives you a restart opportunity.


[31-May-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I bet with 100+ days invested, you will have a quicker restart just by rebuilding your current company

**Myrtenaster**:	Very difficult start on Danakil tbh. May be worth going to Promitor instead. Feel free to spend some time getting to know things and use COLIQ to restart and go to Promitor. (totally up to you, just because you chose Food doesn't mean you have to build Food). It's just that Danakil doesn't really have the proper resources to make Food an easy choice here :)

**Isoroku**:	I would suggest choosing one of the planets that are full with ghost plots. There is usually a good monetary reason that is the case. There is no easy start, but Promitor is the easiest of those. Again, reasons. Getting PRO can open up other avenues, and speed up the time needed for expansion of revenue and bases, but it is not necessary

[17-Jul-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Sent me your prices as well please.


[17-Jul-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I generally just look at the Local Markets when I have empty space, but there are several players who pretty much just do shipping.


[17-Jul-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Ok, will keep it in mind for future loads/


[17-Jul-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Do you need them moved from Montem to Danakil?


[17-Jul-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	@Argonautis :: my advice is to post it in two different adds, one Montem->Moria and a second one Moria->Danakil


[17-Jul-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	There is alot of traffic to and from Moria - but Montem direct to Danakil is less likely.


[17-Jul-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Great tips didnt think about that.


[17-Jul-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Yes Andy ideally i would like the moved from Montem to Danakil.


[17-Jul-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Yeah, I'd go with what Craftsman said


[17-Jul-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Ok Thanks, will do.


[17-Jul-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	What prices I am looking at for a 1200t load?


[17-Jul-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I'm honestly not sure what people want on average for shipping. Whenever I post contracts I usually post them pretty high so they get taken quickly.


[17-Jul-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Maybe 10/t from Montem->MOR?

**Argonautis**:	Unfortunally Moria-Valis is full! I was planning to get my next base there and had everything ready prefabs in my cargohold and just as I tried to set up my flag, it turns out there was no more space on the planet.


[10-Aug-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	yes, it is full, what would you like to produce @Argonautis


[10-Aug-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	For  metallurgy you can try Berthier, Sabaton or Titan


[10-Aug-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	FE mainly and was going to see where to expand afterwards


[10-Aug-24 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	Kiruna has  a lot of FEO and metallurgy COGC


[10-Aug-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	XH-594b


[10-Aug-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**-butterfly-**:	it is rocky planet, you need MCG, no special materials


[10-Aug-24 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Argonautis**:	Its a nice canditate but its a bit to far away from my demand base.


[10-Aug-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kegman96**:	Welcome to Danakil we’re usually pretty quiet here but if you ever have questions someone is floating around


[10-Aug-24 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Fair enough and Thanks! I think the guides have done their job for the moment atleast, seems like a quiet game in general


[10-Aug-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Yeah, once you develop your base a bit more and can work towards getting more bases it gets more interactive


[10-Aug-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	for example my buddy and I now run parallel production lines and make all of our own consumable


[10-Aug-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hybridwolf**:	farmsteads sorry


[17-Aug-24 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Eventually I'd recommend getting a spot on a planet with Agriculture CoGC and moving your farms there so you can get the 25% bonus


[17-Aug-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Danakil has a 25% construction bonus


[17-Aug-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	ah


[17-Aug-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I see


[17-Aug-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Well my brokie tail has gotta stick with the beans and bread


[17-Aug-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	The CoGC bonus is too good to pass up, so I highly recommend building your bases around it


[17-Aug-24 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	for now


[17-Aug-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Yeah, it's a slow start


[17-Aug-24 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hybridwolf**:	Dogs are fun to


[17-Aug-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	why is it tht for speed people recomend getting loans


[17-Aug-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I assume becuase it benefits people


[17-Aug-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It gives you the capital to expand your production much faster than you would be able to otherwise


[17-Aug-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Just depends on how you want to play the game


[17-Aug-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	If you're bored with the slow start loans would be a good idea


[17-Aug-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	If not, than just keep on trucking


[17-Aug-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hybridwolf**:	likely


[18-Aug-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	But itd be cool


[18-Aug-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	But with the way this game seems to work itll be like a group vote effort type deal


[18-Aug-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	with how slow this game is my adhd brain is very tempted by a loan


[18-Aug-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	yeah i started on Vallis and a loan really kicked my progress up


[18-Aug-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	honestly once I had a farm on Verdant things got a lot better


[18-Aug-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I have small food production on this rock


[18-Aug-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	cant recommend those luxury consumables enough btw, 100% happiness really helps with production


[18-Aug-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I am broke


[18-Aug-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Cant afford luxury goods


[18-Aug-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	one sec


[18-Aug-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Workers got food and clothes tho


[18-Aug-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	those should give you a little bump


[18-Aug-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	i sent you 2 contracts


[18-Aug-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I see those


[18-Aug-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I cant accept those


[18-Aug-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Thank you tho


[18-Aug-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	i make all my own it costs me nothing


[18-Aug-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I literaly cant accept the contracts. Im on the free license


[18-Aug-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	or will it not let you?


[18-Aug-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	ooooh that sucks


[18-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	yeah that is


[18-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	does


[18-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	i take too much stuff for granted now that i got the pro been playing for months now


[18-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Becuase i need atleast a basic one to accept player to player contracts


[18-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	and yeah that doesnt come until after the pro wears off


[18-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	should i reject them or can you close them?


[18-Aug-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I do appreciate the offer tho


[18-Aug-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	MAT PWO


[18-Aug-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I assume those are things i havent seen yet


[18-Aug-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, the luxury for pioneers


[18-Aug-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I thought you two were talking about those


[18-Aug-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	AH I see


[18-Aug-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	One of them is PWO, at it is a must have


[18-Aug-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It's usage rate is very low, so always worth having those


[18-Aug-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Im just broke in game and that is what we were talking about


[18-Aug-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	The other guy tried to give me some


[18-Aug-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yeah, aint gonna work


[18-Aug-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I noticced


[18-Aug-24 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Becuase im playing for *freeee*


[18-Aug-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Did you think that a game about c a p i t a l i s m will be fully availably for free? :)


[18-Aug-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	no but id expect play to player interactions to be fully open


[18-Aug-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	but expectations be damned


[18-Aug-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	New accounts get too much assets for this to be free


[18-Aug-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	If that was the case, one could just spam new accounts and transfer their funds and stuff to their main account


[18-Aug-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	true. should be limited but I cant accept a contract from someone dont need to make or anything just accept and do


[18-Aug-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yeah, the restrictions could have been less strict


[18-Aug-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	just spend money and do it :)


[18-Aug-24 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	But that would mean more work, and also less money(because people would be a little less motivated to buy PRO)


[18-Aug-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	I mean IT would also retain players a bit. becuase unless i upgrade im essentiality on my own


[18-Aug-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yeah, kind of


[18-Aug-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	There are ways to circumvent it via CX, but it is not reliable


[18-Aug-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	if players could do work like transit or production for other players.


[18-Aug-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And game is actually pretty playable for free, I have bought PRO a week ago


[18-Aug-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	(my account age says I've been here for 307 days)


[18-Aug-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	fair enough


[18-Aug-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	Im sure the loopholes such systems would make would cause problems


[18-Aug-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Probably yeah


[18-Aug-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	as it stands the player interaction i have is the chat room


[19-Aug-24 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-24 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Aug-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Aug-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-24 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hybridwolf**:	More then one day


[31-Aug-24 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-24 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	i refil at ~10 days to a 29day loadout for consumables. As for production inputs thats far more dependent on how much space it all needs. Places that are low space like my NL planets are 29days for all of it. Where as here i need I and FE and that takes a ton of space

[06-Sep-24 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	In 21 days!


[06-Sep-24 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	@BraveCasperCat the production fees are very much inline with the costs to run the planet. Just so you know Fee maximums on faction planets are a 120/240/360/1440/2640.


[06-Sep-24 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	and the maximum fees on starting planets are 90/180/270/1080/1980. This is a starting planet.


[06-Sep-24 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	For comparison, the minimum fees on starting planets are 10/20/30/120/220. RIght now we have 40/60/240/480/1200, and that's more than minimum. I think it can be IMPROVED.


[06-Sep-24 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Is that so, i need that link then so i can readup on that


[06-Sep-24 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Nevermind i found it via the wiki


[06-Sep-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	So where do you propose the rest of the money comes from to support the planets needs?


[06-Sep-24 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	Warehouse fees and Local Market fees.


[06-Sep-24 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	And Base Establishment fees (but much less so on starting planets)


[06-Sep-24 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	When you will be a Governor - you will find that fees of Warehouse, LM and establishing not gathering the costs planet need


[06-Sep-24 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	I just noticed now high the warehouse fees here are at 750/u i will be dumping the 10 units i have lol


[06-Sep-24 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	It was simple used for sorting, something i can do on MOR easy enough.


[06-Sep-24 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	75/u \o/


[06-Sep-24 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed, while WAR brings 309,750 per week well no its now 302,250 since i droppped my WAR's. you should do up the math to what it really takes to keep the planet rolling a week. Don't forget to account for the ghost bases as well, that sit full of population but producing nothing.


[06-Sep-24 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed i did the math wrong on that @star i seen 750 and took that as each.


[06-Sep-24 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	so that said the 413 warehouse that were rented, would generate 30,975 per week that wont cover the 1250 DW used the SST per week

[06-Sep-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Do you have any Setlers? Each refinery uses 60 PIO and 20 SET. Setlers need HB2.


[07-Sep-24 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Andy97**:	I see somebody saying the WAR brings in over 300K/wk


[14-Sep-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You're off by a factor of 10. It brought in 31,609 last week


[14-Sep-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	@Crash5291 That's right on what I'm paying now


[14-Sep-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	@BraveCaperCat I've spent 16.5 million NCC on upkeep since I started here and I've made 9 million in revenue.


[14-Sep-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	You can win and lower fees, but I hope you're prepared to pay for those expenses out of pocket!


[14-Sep-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Oh, I see the correction on the WAR math


[14-Sep-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Yeah it was me that messed up the war math, i seen my total bill and took it as per unit. was thinking it was high like Pallada (its 2k/week per unit). Was glad to see it was same and picked up the space again lol

[15-Sep-24 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Sep-24 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Sep-24 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	There are no benefits


[15-Sep-24 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	Governors can change the local rules. That is a benefit. What are the rest!


[15-Sep-24 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Shrewdsun1**:	Yeah, you gotta work your way up from smaller planet


[15-Sep-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	The one counterpoint is that they would be part of a parliament - so they can learn how to run the planet from more experienced people who are also on the parliament


[15-Sep-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Fair enough


[15-Sep-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Phoenixtfg**:	does everyone who runs automatically get put onto parlament or is limited to top few candidates?


[15-Sep-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	You need a PRO Licence to run for governor.


[15-Sep-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The number of MPs depend on the number of bases on the planet. You can find the info with the ADM command for that planet


[15-Sep-24 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BraveCaperCat**:	Will i have your vote?


[15-Sep-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ThreeE**:	I assume bots are against the rules -- but, like Eve Online, I never really understood why not -- I mean -- it is a scifi setting....


[14-Oct-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	I was thinking about it the other day


[14-Oct-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	It'd be interesting to have an AI company in the game


[14-Oct-24 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	You could have components like Factorio does to do basic circuits for ship scheduling and stuff.


[14-Oct-24 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Ahhh, you mean having it for certain functions within your own company


[14-Oct-24 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	yeah, I think the devs would not embrace bots that use API calls


[14-Oct-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	as the number of ships grows the loses its "idle" nature fast!


[14-Oct-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	the game loses


[14-Oct-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Oh yeah


[14-Oct-24 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	That's where I find the challenge in this game


[14-Oct-24 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Andy97**:	Keeping on top of all the repair/resupply cycles


[14-Oct-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	yeah -- still trying to outsource shipping...


[14-Oct-24 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I agree with the need for some degree of shipping automation.


[14-Oct-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I expounded on this some in reponse to a post in the forum recently.


[15-Oct-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, I would settle for setting a recurring ship/delivery :: every Monday load 200 DW on ship Tramp at Moria.  It fails if something isn't in the right place.

[21-Nov-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Nov-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Nov-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Nov-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, probably not here on Danakil, H2O extraction rate is bad here


[21-Nov-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThreeE**:	build stuff that aligns with the COGC -- construction


[21-Nov-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Nov-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Dec-24 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Oh, I've scraped my bfabs off Danakil, were taking up too much space. They're all on Sabaton now, with added bonus of almost no heavy shipping :)

[20-Jan-25 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	As of last POPR there were 245 Engis in the reserve pool, and we're gaining ~130/week. If you built engi buildings this week, you'll get up to 375 available between you and any others with engineers. Doesn't seem like a shortage of engineers


[20-Jan-25 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Looks like there's actually 350 engineers currently in the reserve pool, so next POPR you'll be full.

[12-Feb-25 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	can I build more production workers than I have buildings and if I do then say I go 10 workers over 1000 1010/1000 would that barely decrease production and might be worth the extra building efficiency?


[12-Feb-25 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If your workers are higher than their fabs, it will correct at the end of the week


[12-Feb-25 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	no I mean I need 1010 workers and only have 1000


[12-Feb-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	or plan to


[12-Feb-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	1000 is the max


[12-Feb-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	10 over is a tiny drop in efficiency, just ignore it


[12-Feb-25 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	I can still build the buildings?


[12-Feb-25 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	1000 area is the max you can build


[12-Feb-25 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	no 1000 workers


[12-Feb-25 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If you need 1010 then you will always be 10 workers short, but in the grand scheme of things that will be a tiny drop in efficiency for you


[12-Feb-25 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Not worth worrying about


[12-Feb-25 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Oh yes sorry, you can build more buildings if 1000 area isnt taken yet


[12-Feb-25 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	no my plan need 1010 workers and my plan says to only get 1000 workers because not enough area so I can I still build the production buildings to go to 1010 workers or does it cap like 950


[12-Feb-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	your cap is the 1000 building area


[12-Feb-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	you still don't get it


[12-Feb-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If you have used only 800 as an example, keep adding worker habs


[12-Feb-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	not 1000 area 1000 workers


[12-Feb-25 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Yes, you can build up to 1000 area. If you are not there yet and need more workers, just build another worker hab


[12-Feb-25 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	you don't get it


[12-Feb-25 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	PaleFire: yes, it's fine if you are missing a few workers


[12-Feb-25 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If you have a 900 area base, and 1500 workers, you have 100 more area to build more worker habs, to take it even higher


[12-Feb-25 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Your limit is area, not people


[12-Feb-25 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	boom: what PaleFire is saying is that they don't want to build an extra hab to house the 10 last workers the production buildings want


[12-Feb-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	In which case its only 10, its a tiny drop in efficiency


[12-Feb-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	yup


[12-Feb-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	Ogrebeef-Backkicker is writing a novel


[12-Feb-25 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Palefire has a sore head from headbutting the wall lol


[12-Feb-25 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	You'll need to build the production buildings and the habs to support all the workers.  If you don't have enough space to build that last HAB then you'll have to decide if it is close enough.  i.e., if your plan calls for 1010 workers but you only have enough space to build HABS that support 1000 then no big deal.  If your HABS will only support 950 workers then it may be a waste to build that final production building.


[12-Feb-25 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PaleFire**:	no I was wondering if I can still build a production to go over 1000 workers but it seems like I can


[12-Feb-25 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	yes


[12-Feb-25 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Yes, area is the limiting factor, not people


[12-Feb-25 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Your production buildings will lose speed directly proportionally to the fraction of workers they are short.


[12-Feb-25 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If you have 95% of the workers your production buildings need, they will operate at 95% speed.


[12-Feb-25 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	So being short 10 of 1010 will reduce your production speed by, what, 0.99%?


[12-Feb-25 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You certainly aren't restricted from building the production buildings, and it might not even be a bad idea depending on the circumstances.

[12-Mar-25 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I had hoped my shipments would have started arriving but it seems the couriers like to take the time slow burning it


[12-Mar-25 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	My God what have I built


[12-Mar-25 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	yeah, don't rely on couriers' timing


[12-Mar-25 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	and we have it pretty good around Moria. I started using couriers around Benten and many of them take as much time as they can, by delaying pickup


[12-Mar-25 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I honestly don't get why would they do that


[12-Mar-25 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Ended up blocking a couple of those


[12-Mar-25 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	I think it's because they want to get the contract even if they don't already have a ship in station


[12-Mar-25 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	so they have to accept it before someone else does


[12-Mar-25 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Yeah, its mean


[12-Mar-25 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I will put 1 day on them in future


[12-Mar-25 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	1 days is rough because it means they have to connect within 24h, and not everyone does


[12-Mar-25 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It stops contract collectors though


[12-Mar-25 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	2 days is the best, they cant pick it when leaving from the station, you dont lose the slow burners that take 1D 9H to deliver


[12-Mar-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	xD


[12-Mar-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	;D


[12-Mar-25 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	idk, i try to be nice to courier because i feel they are not paid enough


[12-Mar-25 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	They were both well paid contracts


[12-Mar-25 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Neither has delivered yet and its been 24 hours


[12-Mar-25 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	x10 weight/vol is the minimum i pay, its fair i think


[12-Mar-25 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	x25 was the deal


[12-Mar-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	i do that in small ones, i cant pay someone 500 or 300ncc, it feels weird


[12-Mar-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	oh yeah, x25 for big shipments is very generous


[12-Mar-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	especially between Moria and Danakil


[12-Mar-25 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Mar-25 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stosXri**:	not sure about those prices


[12-Mar-25 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Mar-25 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**boom_badda_boom**:	Just let me do some maths


[19-Mar-25 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It would be 230, sorry I already got a load earlier


[19-Mar-25 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I got 336


[19-Mar-25 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I need mountains of it, perhaps we could agree a weekly deal?


[19-Mar-25 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	1000 AL once per week or something


[19-Mar-25 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Mar-25 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If its 1 - 230 and you are willing to wait 9 hours for payment, please send it through

**boom_badda_boom**:	Yes I will pay


[20-Mar-25 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If I have to put moria LM up I cannot put a 4 hour time limit on a contract, and dont get me wrong, I would pay really well for such a fast delivery

[24-Mar-25 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-25 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Jeez, making nylon on a TSH planet sounds like a pain.


[24-Mar-25 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	it's probably pretty bad since WPL are so bad in terms of profit/area, but since you'd only be repairing 8 WPL or so it's probably one of the cheaper industries to place on a TSH world


[24-Mar-25 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	More profitable things to do on 4 more planets


[24-Mar-25 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I think 6000/unit would probably be a fair price for NL


[24-Mar-25 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
