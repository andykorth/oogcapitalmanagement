So I have some PSL on Heph, I know other people were looking for some too. I'll move it to ANT to help out with the various projects


[27-Jun-24 01:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have a lot of HSE and TSH if needed


[27-Jun-24 02:04 PM] katinga#0000
waiting on the PSL from Exospace.  I gotta go pick up some prefabs


[27-Jun-24 02:56 PM] katinga#0000
is anyone currently on 382c?


[27-Jun-24 02:58 PM] tuffyless#0000
not i.  a & g myself


[27-Jun-24 03:00 PM] katinga#0000
g is  a good spot


[27-Jun-24 03:00 PM] katinga#0000
we will need some folks on c though.  ngl


[27-Jun-24 05:35 PM] katinga#0000
Do you want G once I put an admin there?


[27-Jun-24 05:54 PM] tuffyless#0000
I dunno.  Prolly not right away.  Dont want to get myself swamped.  Ill reassess the workload after awhile

If you want I can start as governor on G. I'm filling the COGC upkeep there anyway.


[28-Jun-24 01:01 AM] katinga#0000
That'd be cool.  I have a ship on the way with materials.  hoping to get the Admin Center up tomorrow afternoon


[28-Jun-24 03:34 PM] katinga#0000
@neth_havoc  or @tuffyless I'm short on a few materials for the Admin Center.  Can you contribute any?  this is on 382g

[28-Jun-24 03:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
I probably have all those on ANT, you can send for them if you can't get them elsewhere sooner


[28-Jun-24 03:40 PM] katinga#0000
I have a ship that'll be at ANT in about 4 hours


[28-Jun-24 03:51 PM] katinga#0000
game crashed on me.  made some orders in the Discord.  Do you have some basic b prefabs or MCG?  I might as well load up the ship that's going out there.  using my WCB


[28-Jun-24 04:37 PM] katinga#0000
g does not have an Infirmary.  putting in /orders for the mats for it.  C has a safety station and an infirmary

[28-Jun-24 04:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I got the BDE and TRU, but not the other stuff


[28-Jun-24 04:40 PM] katinga#0000
I have the OFF for the upkeep.  I'll worry about the other 2 later.  I got 8 days on that.  I mainly need the prefabs


[28-Jun-24 04:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I might have BBH and BSE and BTA


[28-Jun-24 04:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly you'll only need the OFF in the INF and the DW in the SST for a whole


[28-Jun-24 04:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
maybe won't even need to keep those totally full, depending on how much you want to optimize


[28-Jun-24 04:42 PM] katinga#0000
I'm running a little low on AIC.  moving some stuff to liquidate


[28-Jun-24 04:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I see 8k people


[28-Jun-24 04:43 PM] katinga#0000
don't you need the infrastructure and upkeep to attract the pop?


[28-Jun-24 04:44 PM] katinga#0000
make your PIOs happy by giving them access to bandaids!


[28-Jun-24 04:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I was told that 70% happiness is enough?


[28-Jun-24 04:46 PM] katinga#0000
happy to take any contributions


[28-Jun-24 04:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk what ‚Äúenough‚Äù means tho


[28-Jun-24 04:46 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok I‚Äôll check in an hour


[28-Jun-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Under 50% happiness you lose pop, above 70% you gain pop. Between 50% and 70% there are no immigration changes

Once you get goin'. No rush to learn all of it


[28-Jun-24 05:20 PM] katinga#0000
I feel like part of it is taking a good look at what's already there, or not there, and identifying easy opportunities


[28-Jun-24 05:28 PM] katinga#0000
do you have AEF?


[28-Jun-24 05:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
I just have 10 AEF


[28-Jun-24 05:55 PM] katinga#0000
ok.  i'll get that later


[28-Jun-24 05:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Other people in corp make it though


[28-Jun-24 11:08 PM] tuffyless#0000
Plenty of LSE + TCS but ohh so little PP3 time.  üò¶
So much INS needed to build + repair.


[28-Jun-24 11:19 PM] katinga#0000
How much HSE do you have at ANT?


[29-Jun-24 12:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
More than 200


[29-Jun-24 12:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
That's why I have 5 pp3 for only 3 pp4


[29-Jun-24 12:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
Then 1 pp2 for AEF and LDE, and 2 wel and that's my whole Nike lol


[29-Jun-24 01:13 PM] katinga#0000
@domicius Hey there!  Let me know if you have any questions about the project.  In a nutshell, I want to develop QJ-382 into a SF refining system to combat the CX prices.  All of the ingredients are there.  So the C and G planets become RE planets to harvest the ingredients and probably i becomes the Refining hub.  Presently, 382c is On Strike, so I am running for Governor to get that planet sorted out and run some PIO programs.  I am going to need help with funding for the upkeep, and some folks (voters) to put some bases on C.  C also needs a Local Market.  I think there's only 1 person there.  G, I am working to get an Admin Center there and an Infirmary.  I have placed a Core Module on G already.  Rise is currently running A, which is fine.  Any contributions in materials and funding would be greatly appreciated.


[30-Jun-24 11:22 PM] katinga#0000
Admin Center is online in G!  Running for gov üôÇ

[01-Jul-24 11:09 AM] katinga#0000
Don't panic!  The QJ-382 system now has a name!  G now has a name, as well!


[01-Jul-24 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
woah big news


[01-Jul-24 11:55 AM] katinga#0000
I wish I could name the I planet Remus


[01-Jul-24 01:50 PM] katinga#0000
until the elections on C and G conclude, the pops on both planets are kinda stuck.  in the meantime, the next steps in the project will be to install some basic infrustructure on Romulan I (what I'm calling Remus from now on), and add warehousing to Romulan C


[03-Jul-24 10:18 AM] katinga#0000
Admin Center, safety station, and infirmary are online at Remus

[03-Jul-24 02:05 PM] katinga#0000
@tuffyless or @neth_havoc do either of you have spare TRU on Romulus?


[03-Jul-24 02:28 PM] neth_havoc#0000
Nope


[03-Jul-24 02:39 PM] tuffyless#0000
nope.


[03-Jul-24 05:05 PM] katinga#0000
no worries.  I've ordered some.  almost ready to send another shipment of materials out there


[03-Jul-24 08:06 PM] katinga#0000
Warehouse is online on C.  In another day and a half, the election will be over and I can set the price


[04-Jul-24 12:11 AM] katinga#0000
Folks, I have control of Romulus as a Governor.  I've already lowered the warehouse rental fee, set a base fee, and fiddled with production fees for RE bases.  Head to Romulus, folks.  Also Romulan C isn't far behind.  I have another day and a half before I have governmental control there.


[04-Jul-24 06:25 PM] katinga#0000
Are there OOG players that would be interested in setting up bases in the Romulan system?


[04-Jul-24 06:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll probably make a WPL base on A


[04-Jul-24 06:27 PM] katinga#0000
I don't have a presence on A.  Another player holds that, for now.  A is a good start though


[04-Jul-24 06:31 PM] katinga#0000
looks like I have the COGC on C fixed.  it's no longer On Strike


[04-Jul-24 07:34 PM] tuffyless#0000
I worked with lukeskye when he was still around to build the infra on A.
Have a 7 WPL / 5 PPF base on A, which the SET's came pretty quick for.
The current gov there is a RoF puppet.


[04-Jul-24 10:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which planet was going to be fuel production COGC?


[04-Jul-24 10:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
And what's the ratio of fuel production bases to EXT bases?


[04-Jul-24 11:17 PM] katinga#0000
i'm setting up Remus as the REF planet.  so players harvest C and Romulus for the ingredients of the short recipe.


[05-Jul-24 09:52 AM] katinga#0000
new POPR is available on Rom C. looks like things are are headed in the right direction

Alright, I've got full control of Remus, running some Immigration programs


[09-Jul-24 12:28 PM] katinga#0000
The new POPR for Romulus came out last night.  The POP has gone up and population programs are in effect.  This fuel project will be in need of more players to extract AMM and Hydrogen.  Will need some players on C, as well, to mine GAL


[09-Jul-24 01:32 PM] katinga#0000

My REF base on Remus is fully staffed on PIO.  operating at 103%.  If someone wanted to set up a REF base there, I'm running 13 REF with 2 STO.  The Settlers are trickling in.

There was this band called Spinal Tap, and they have guitar amps where the volume goes from 1 to 11


[17-Jul-24 11:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
most other guitar amps volume only goes up to 10

*taps the mic* Is this thing on?  Looking for some neighbors in the Romulan system.  I'm willing to help defray some of the cost of two or three new bases on the planets I govern.


[18-Jul-24 09:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think the unemployment could hold some bases. I'm totally out of permits but if you make a post on UFO, make sure to mention the COGCs and the unique synergies

I might start buying it from you there and ship it to Romulan a


[27-Aug-24 09:36 AM] katinga#0000
I do not harvest H on Romulus.  I harvest it on Ant2G.  I harvest AMM on Romulus

Rise isn‚Äôt being all that responsive to my messages via DM. I‚Äôve shipped materials to upgrade either the INF or the SST. Looks like health satisfaction is already at >90%. So figure I should upgrade the SST which should push the happiness for SET above 70% and cause some migrations. Any thoughts?


[16-Sep-24 12:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
If we've learned anything from Life, all we need to do is run against him on the planet and he'll suddenly be very responsive üòÑ


[16-Sep-24 02:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
How many settlers did you add this report?


[16-Sep-24 02:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh dang I started a motion and forgot to actually finish it


[16-Sep-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Okay we got 600 SET coming next time


[16-Sep-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
snuck it in before the report


[16-Sep-24 02:45 PM] akyantor#0000
630


[16-Sep-24 02:45 PM] akyantor#0000
So that should get pretty close to filling th gap


[16-Sep-24 06:24 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Indeed, now that I'm an MP on Life things mysteriously get done...


[16-Sep-24 11:53 PM] akyantor#0000
I did get a response last night, it sounds like he discussed it with Archiel.


[17-Sep-24 09:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Looks like we nailed the population


[17-Sep-24 09:38 AM] katinga#0000
how many blue pills did that take?


[17-Sep-24 09:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
A whole festival worth


[17-Sep-24 09:51 AM] hernanduer#0000
I was thinking matrix and didn't understand


[17-Sep-24 10:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I don't remember which color pills did what in the movie


[17-Sep-24 10:16 AM] marat_sh#0000
If I remember correctly Blue to stay in simulation and red to wake up in real world


[17-Sep-24 10:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
Also if I am gonna plan my WLP base on romulan a Do I also need to coordinate it with festivals? üòÖ

as a young man, not really a thing for me to worry about üòÑ


[17-Sep-24 10:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
I was also thinking you meant X, not little blue pills


[17-Sep-24 10:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
though I think they both result in similar parties


[17-Sep-24 10:32 AM] katinga#0000
well, the context was Archiel 'nailing the population'

Does anyone need anything from or on Romulus? I can expand but don't really have the transportation to scale here yet.


[10-Mar-25 12:28 PM] katinga#0000
are you still running with starter ships?


[10-Mar-25 12:31 PM] katinga#0000
I can help with some materials to upgrade one of your ships.  I believe Archiel helps newer players upgrade their HQ so you can get more permits.  I set up infrastructure on Rom C, Romulus, and Remus for SF operations.


[10-Mar-25 12:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup those first 15 permits are pretty cheap!


[11-Mar-25 09:18 AM] lax9552#0000
I am on starter ships. They are now beginning to be my bottlenecks. Would love to at least get their cargo bays up.


[11-Mar-25 09:19 AM] lax9552#0000
That would be great. I get hq 4 today.  I would love to be able to scale dirt cheap fuel for us all.


[11-Mar-25 09:25 AM] katinga#0000
Archiel, and I believe a few others, make ship parts to build/upgrade ships


[11-Mar-25 09:26 AM] .urpalhal#0000
There is also the ship upgrade kit in ADI


[11-Mar-25 09:26 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It provides everything to upgrade starter ships to a WCB and such


[11-Mar-25 09:30 AM] katinga#0000
WCB is best for hauling ores and heavy cargo.  Your decision, Laxy, but you might want to go with a general 2k/2k cargo bay


[11-Mar-25 09:31 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I would agree that WCB is better for Ore and Metals and other heavy stuffs, but it is the easiest upgrade from the starter ship


[11-Mar-25 09:32 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Financially i think it makes more sense to just buy a new LCB ship rather than upgrade to one


[11-Mar-25 09:33 AM] katinga#0000
considering that you're upgrading the fuel tanks and possibly the engines, i agree.  you're rebuilding the ship anyway


[11-Mar-25 09:34 AM] .urpalhal#0000
On top of that you have to upgrade the Crew Quarters for the LCB where as for an upgrade to WCB you don‚Äôt need a new Crew Quarters


[11-Mar-25 09:36 AM] katinga#0000
It's your choice which route you'd rather go with a ship


[11-Mar-25 09:36 AM] katinga#0000
might be better to upgrade the starters to 1k/1k ships and then build a 2k/2k from scratch


[11-Mar-25 09:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
3k/1k >> 1k/1k and there is almost no difference in the bill of materials to upgrade to a WCB vs a MCB

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[11-Mar-25 10:40 AM] lax9552#0000
I play alot, and I don't think that will change, so I think we can route  it this way. 
Starter 
WCB (ADI assistance) 
New LCB (work toward). 

This kinda hits my sweet spot.


[11-Mar-25 10:41 AM] lax9552#0000
Keep the starter as a ferry


[11-Mar-25 10:44 AM] lax9552#0000
But simultaneously I need to plan expansion. The AMM on romulus is good for integrating my raw but the roi sucks. 

I could also, start to move my ref operation off Deimos and onto a fuel cogc.


[11-Mar-25 10:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
Cost of LCB and WCB is almost equal, but WCB has 2k more tonnage, basically no reason not to do it. Even if you think theres no point for you (I thought the same at one point) there will come a time where you will use thst extra space, even just slightly, and be happy that you got it.


[11-Mar-25 10:44 AM] katinga#0000
Remus has a fuel refi COGC.  that's where I refine


[11-Mar-25 10:45 AM] lax9552#0000
With more cargo that's probably long term solution.


[11-Mar-25 10:45 AM] lax9552#0000
Then I can ship straight to ANT.


[11-Mar-25 10:47 AM] katinga#0000
I mine the Gal on Rom C (there's your WCB job), the AMM on Rom, and refine on Remus.  I get the H on Ant2G.


[11-Mar-25 10:48 AM] lax9552#0000
Okay, I will need to hit prunplaner hard tonight.


[11-Mar-25 10:50 AM] katinga#0000
I also have a warehouse at Origo.  the Rom system has a fairly high micrometeor factor that will beat up your ship going planet to planet.  I warp out to Origo and then back in to another planet to avoid that damage.


[11-Mar-25 10:51 AM] lax9552#0000
I already ct with TREE for 10k FF/d so income is steady.


[11-Mar-25 10:52 AM] lax9552#0000
Im a big risk management guy, so I may move a little slow.


[11-Mar-25 10:53 AM] katinga#0000
Once you get your fleet to how you want it, I can easily sell you the H you need if you're cooking SF

I will cook anything, call me Heisenburg


[11-Mar-25 10:55 AM] lax9552#0000
Romulus is crazy for H.


[11-Mar-25 10:55 AM] katinga#0000
Yeah but I need the AMM from there more than the H


[11-Mar-25 10:56 AM] lax9552#0000
I see. AMM that hard to come by?


[11-Mar-25 10:56 AM] katinga#0000

I'm going to move my Deimos REFs to ZV-759e, 

While that is happening i need to decide in ship path. 

then expand my he3 production in IY-206i.  The roi is too enticing on ZV-759e. 

Long term I want to get more ref for the rim in romulan.
