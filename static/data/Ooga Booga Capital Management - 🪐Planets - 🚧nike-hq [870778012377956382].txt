@insensless72 I'm planning on picking up LST from Nike in 2-3 days. How much do you charge for a full ship, and do you need anything shipped there?


[08-Aug-21 01:11 PM] insensless72#0000
Yes i might need some things shipped. From where?


[08-Aug-21 01:11 PM] insensless72#0000
Also 6300 for 183 if youre picking it up


[08-Aug-21 01:26 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Phobos and/or ANT. I'm making a stop on CX. I can also drop by Deimos If I can get enough profit to cover the extra fuel.


[08-Aug-21 01:27 PM] spatial_piano#0000
approach landing takoff and departure total to around 90 SF, which is nearly 1k


[08-Aug-21 01:29 PM] insensless72#0000
I need to get DW to Nike but I my LST needs some time to sell on market


[08-Aug-21 01:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
You don't have liquidity for water?üòÜ  I can pre-pay the LST if you don't have enough for the DW before I leave CX.


[08-Aug-21 01:35 PM] insensless72#0000
Lol i have 4k in the bank and i need like 100


[08-Aug-21 01:36 PM] insensless72#0000
Also I have a batch ready in 10hrs but its all promised


[08-Aug-21 01:36 PM] insensless72#0000
The next batch could be yours in 2.5days


[08-Aug-21 01:36 PM] spatial_piano#0000
That fits my schedule


[08-Aug-21 01:38 PM] insensless72#0000
Sounds like a plan. Ill give you an exact timeline once these are done

@spatial_piano My previous arrangment fell through, do you want the batch of LST I have currently?


[09-Aug-21 01:16 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm about to leave to CX, so it will be 2-3 days before I can pick up (I miscalculated previously). I can take the contract now though.


[09-Aug-21 01:17 PM] insensless72#0000
Do you have room to bring some stuff to Nike from CX?


[09-Aug-21 01:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have nothing but room basically


[09-Aug-21 01:18 PM] insensless72#0000
Sweet. its only 10.4t


[09-Aug-21 01:20 PM] insensless72#0000

[09-Aug-21 01:24 PM] insensless72#0000
Awesome, thanks!


[09-Aug-21 01:55 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm taking OVE, MCG, PWO, PE, SEA and SIO to CX, so If you want to buy any of those I can bring some.


[09-Aug-21 01:56 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Free delivery for orders above 1000AIC


[09-Aug-21 01:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Free delivery also for orders below 1000 AIC

[09-Aug-21 01:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if your order is exactly 1000 AIC, prepare to pay fees


[09-Aug-21 02:00 PM] spatial_piano#0000
For orders exactly 1000AIC. the delivery fee is 1000AIC, but you get a 100% discount on everything you buy


[09-Aug-21 02:41 PM] insensless72#0000
I could use some OVE and PWO actually


[09-Aug-21 02:41 PM] insensless72#0000
how much could you bring and how much ea?


[10-Aug-21 08:52 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I got 20 PWO @120/u and 121 OVE @60/u


[10-Aug-21 10:19 AM] insensless72#0000
You can bring it all if you want, or bring half of each and get a better price in the market for the other half


[10-Aug-21 10:30 AM] insensless72#0000
Actually I'll take all the PWO but 60 OVE


[10-Aug-21 12:23 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Right, bringing those along.


[10-Aug-21 02:53 PM] spatial_piano#0000
ETA to Nike 21h. Do you want to post the buys now?

Do you produce EXO as well?


[28-Aug-21 01:20 PM] spatial_piano#0000
yes, but I don't have any on the ship right now.


[28-Aug-21 01:20 PM] insensless72#0000

[28-Aug-21 01:22 PM] spatial_piano#0000

@insensless72 I am reading shit in game that makes it look like there is a developing LST shortage

i have 3 already


[30-Aug-21 08:48 PM] insensless72#0000
Whats crazy is its selling higher on planets than it is on market


[30-Aug-21 08:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea that could possibly be explained by people anticipating a CX price** spike and trying to get it from the sources


[30-Aug-21 08:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the ask prices are up on all 4 exchanges, getting into very old sell offers


[31-Aug-21 02:41 AM] spatial_piano#0000
ETA 13h


[31-Aug-21 07:01 AM] insensless72#0000
I'll be home at 4:30 EST, we can trade anytime after that


[31-Aug-21 11:36 AM] spatial_piano#0000
That is quite late here, so I'm not sure if I'll be up at that time.


[31-Aug-21 11:55 AM] insensless72#0000
I can hop on and post the ads now if you're available


[31-Aug-21 11:56 AM] spatial_piano#0000

[20-Sep-21 06:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
At some point i feel like adding an 18th extractor is just going to make shit more difficult


[20-Sep-21 06:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Maybe thats just poor people problems.


[20-Sep-21 06:31 PM] insensless72#0000

this is over 16h ago


[20-Dec-21 01:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We could take over the LST market


[20-Dec-21 02:59 PM] insensless72#0000
We should regulate the LST market and try to drive up prices if we can. Slow dump


[21-Dec-21 01:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano You and I should commit to building another LST extractor each


[21-Dec-21 01:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we both have the STO capacity increase on Nike so I think it makes sense to stock up


[21-Dec-21 01:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also @insensless72 I have fed the COGC on nike with 60 RAT and 40 DW. The planet-wide construction bonus is back


[21-Dec-21 01:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
All I need is 16 BSE. I already have the space for the PIOs


[21-Dec-21 01:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can sell you 16 FE on Nike


[21-Dec-21 01:18 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah, that works as well


[21-Dec-21 01:18 PM] spatial_piano#0000
What's the price


[21-Dec-21 01:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have to charge 420 as it was made on KI-401 and shipped to Nike :/


[21-Dec-21 01:21 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ah. I think it's better I buy from CX then, I have a ship about to leave there.


[21-Dec-21 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

@spatial_piano Could I get 1000 MCG from you on Nike at your convenience?


[22-Dec-21 01:29 PM] spatial_piano#0000
You could get up to 775 now, but the rest would have to wait for my next round there.


[25-Dec-21 11:57 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@insensless72 I have the full 1000 now if you still need it. Price is 18


[26-Dec-21 07:27 AM] insensless72#0000
@spatial_piano Ill take that MCG from you when youre available


[26-Dec-21 08:06 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@insensless72 is now good?


[26-Dec-21 08:07 AM] insensless72#0000
Now is great


[26-Dec-21 08:08 AM] spatial_piano#0000

The decision to drop extra bases on Nike depends on the above. Please stay tuned üôÇ


[31-Dec-21 08:12 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The corporate HQ will be built no matter what, and the RFABs are already in production.


[31-Dec-21 08:13 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We just need to know which planet to drop it on.

[31-Dec-21 08:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yaro, if you provide the BMF and BWS that would be huge! I think we have the RFABS covered, but we are limited by epoxy when making RSE


[31-Dec-21 08:26 AM] dasefx1#0000

[31-Dec-21 04:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
BDE @ 800


[31-Dec-21 04:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
22 BBH * 800 = 17600

8 BDE * 800 = 6400

Can't post buys without base/warehouse, should I just rent a warehouse for a week?


[31-Dec-21 04:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes.


[31-Dec-21 04:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You can take the warehouse fees out of the BTA offer or something like that


[31-Dec-21 04:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
not too expensive though


[31-Dec-21 04:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The BTA will be ready in 26 hours.

@colerror if you're sending a ship to Nike lmk if you want to flip some LST


[31-Dec-21 04:19 PM] colerror#0000
Sure, can do


[31-Dec-21 04:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 I can transfer 6 KV to you on Nike tomorrow. if you want to post the 1 AIC buy with 3 day delivery I will accept it now

I have enough PSL for 2, but only enough LFABs for 1.


[31-Dec-21 04:25 PM] insensless72#0000
I do actually


[31-Dec-21 04:25 PM] insensless72#0000

[31-Dec-21 04:26 PM] insensless72#0000
11 of those


[31-Dec-21 04:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Looks like we need 12 more PSL and some TRU to make 3 of these bad boys


[31-Dec-21 04:28 PM] insensless72#0000
I'll hold these lfabs for Corp use


[31-Dec-21 04:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[01-Jan-22 10:25 AM] colerror#0000
I have a ship that will be leaving Nike to Phobos later today. Currently sitting at 45.6/27.4 if anyone needs anything moved


[01-Jan-22 10:25 AM] colerror#0000
I can even follow on to the CX if anyone needs it


[01-Jan-22 10:27 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
filling it to the brim with limestone is probably your best bet


[01-Jan-22 10:28 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is an easy sell on Phobos because there are so many BMP making MCG with it

[01-Jan-22 11:15 AM] dasefx1#0000

@bitcoin_ape if you want we can wait for Molp üôÇ

to confirm üôÇ


[01-Jan-22 11:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes, I am waiting for molp to confirm. He said he was on vacation and did not know for sure from memory


[01-Jan-22 11:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For RFABs, we are missing RSE and RDE. The KV is already guaranteed by Earthling for the RDE production so it mostly comes down to epoxy and PP3 time.


[01-Jan-22 11:37 AM] dasefx1#0000
ok so I will try to produce some RSE and RDE. RDE I got KV, only problem recently was LDE, as I used a lot for HQ upgrade üôÇ


[01-Jan-22 11:42 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I also find myself out of LDE üòÜ


[01-Jan-22 11:42 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[01-Jan-22 01:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I don't happen to have any on Nike right now, and I forgot to load put any to the ship.


[01-Jan-22 01:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
It might take 2 days to ship some in by myself


[01-Jan-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats fine, I can produce more RSE while waiting if I cant get any LDEs in time


[01-Jan-22 01:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i will be happy to buy them in the future, going to need the equivalent of 11 LDE to work through this KV


[01-Jan-22 01:57 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have some NL on both Phobos and CX, So if anyone is going to Nike i can ship some in sooner.

[04-Jan-22 11:11 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
On the 23 AEF buy, we can include the labor cost for producing with PP2, and the supplies will be transferred in 1 AIC trades


[04-Jan-22 11:13 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we have busy work days starting here, maybe it could be done in a few hours time? just notify me on discord


[04-Jan-22 11:22 AM] dasefx1#0000
no problem üôÇ I should be on discord. When you rest, let me know. you can give me products. For labor cost you can choose, but I prefer some products like PG, MCG, PE, SF, FF or others equivalent instead cash.


[04-Jan-22 11:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Great. I will see what earthling is willing to trade. I believe you are neighbors on Phobos, Harmonia and Griffonstone, so there should be an option somewhere in those inventories

@dasefx1 @insensless72 Insensless and I discussed briefly last night and think it is best to reduce LST price to 8000 AIC per shipload. I include you yaro because Nutrien is in on our price fixing operation üòÑ


[07-Jan-22 02:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
whenever these 9150 offers expire we should re-list at 8000 and hopefully clean up


[07-Jan-22 03:14 PM] dasefx1#0000
ok sure


[07-Jan-22 08:19 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@everyone Finally got my base on Nike, thanks to all that help me with supplies and materials!

welcome to Nike! Hope you like rocks


[08-Jan-22 01:21 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 @insensless72 would either of you buy kombucha, PE, OVE, or PWO on Nike?


[08-Jan-22 01:21 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There is also 75 GL, 1400 MCG, 4 KV, 2 NL and 120 SEA on this ship


[08-Jan-22 01:22 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will be buying small amounts of MCG and GL but not much.


[08-Jan-22 01:23 AM] insensless72#0000
I will, How much OVE, and PWO are available? id also take the 75 GL (increments of 25) if possible


[08-Jan-22 01:24 AM] insensless72#0000

[08-Jan-22 01:24 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
80 OVE, 70 PWO


[08-Jan-22 01:24 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will buy 25 GL if you will buy the other 50

[08-Jan-22 01:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[08-Jan-22 01:26 AM] insensless72#0000
i only want 40 OVE, all the PWO, 50 GL and 2 NL


[08-Jan-22 01:28 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
OVE 50 AIC
PWO 125 AIC
GL 150 AIC
NL 1600 AIC


[08-Jan-22 01:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[08-Jan-22 03:33 AM] dasefx1#0000
I am intrested in KOM and GL  :), PE depends on price


[08-Jan-22 10:18 AM] domicius#0000
What price do you want PE and how much?


[08-Jan-22 10:24 AM] dasefx1#0000
hard to say üôÇ as I produce PE, only I need to build some reserve maybe 5k PE


[08-Jan-22 10:25 AM] domicius#0000
How much you want to spend?


[08-Jan-22 10:46 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 the KOM and PE from Earthling is on Phobos


[08-Jan-22 10:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The glass is sold. Maybe we should prioritize some more glass furnace on Deimos


[08-Jan-22 12:52 PM] domicius#0000
You know - rethinking it, I'd need a fair bit of hydrogen and right now I just have a minimum quantity.


[08-Jan-22 12:53 PM] domicius#0000
So it would be a few days before I could supply


[08-Jan-22 12:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
ok thanks @domicius you can take it from antares II g


[08-Jan-22 12:53 PM] domicius#0000
How much?


[08-Jan-22 12:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
40 p/u


[08-Jan-22 12:54 PM] dasefx1#0000
if small I can sold on phobos for 60 p/u


[08-Jan-22 12:56 PM] domicius#0000
I need 50 to make 5k PE, so 3000AIC


[08-Jan-22 12:57 PM] dasefx1#0000
ok list them


[08-Jan-22 12:57 PM] dasefx1#0000

[08-Jan-22 12:58 PM] dasefx1#0000
you can pay later


[08-Jan-22 12:59 PM] domicius#0000
Would you pay 15k for 5k PE?


[08-Jan-22 01:00 PM] dasefx1#0000
sure üòâ


[08-Jan-22 01:02 PM] domicius#0000
Great - so the diff is 12k. listed

While I'm waiting for this person to complete a LM order, does anyone need anything shipped to Nike from Phobos or CX?


[08-Jan-22 06:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
No, not from phobos. Thanks for offering


[08-Jan-22 06:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Oh, there is one small order of 5 KV, if your ship is already going to fly from Phobos to Nike


[08-Jan-22 06:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
5 KV is not worth a flight by itself.


[08-Jan-22 07:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Perhaps Figaro could also rent a warehouse on Nike and ship the 10 RBH with this flight


[08-Jan-22 07:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714


[08-Jan-22 07:12 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, already flying. Give me 5 days though? 2 left on contract, quick trip to CX to pick some things up, then head over to Nike Hopefully this person provisions this MCG before the end of the deadline


[08-Jan-22 07:12 PM] colerror#0000
If it's for HQ, I can just take it over and toss it in


[08-Jan-22 07:15 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape i can give the RBH to someone on Phobos and they can ship it to Nike


[08-Jan-22 07:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The KV and RBH are for HQ, yes. but the KV needs to be used in a PP3 on Nike so it should go to me


[08-Jan-22 07:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thanks @figaro0714 , that would be @colerror


[08-Jan-22 07:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
5+ days is fine


[08-Jan-22 07:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
shipment posted for KV


[08-Jan-22 07:18 PM] figaro0714#0000
Np, @colerror can buy it off me for 1 AIC


[08-Jan-22 07:19 PM] colerror#0000

[09-Jan-22 10:32 AM] colerror#0000
I've actually got some RBH enroute


[09-Jan-22 06:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ok, if yaro contributed the 10 RBH then we should return figaro‚Äôs RBH


[09-Jan-22 06:52 PM] insensless72#0000
I have the remaining 4 RTA queued up, itll just be a couple days


[09-Jan-22 06:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we are limited by epoxy. I can only make so much before the lack of PG money becomes an issue.


[09-Jan-22 06:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its not enough to keep my PP3 busy


[09-Jan-22 06:55 PM] insensless72#0000
I have 3 POL running epoxy only, it floats me but barely


[09-Jan-22 06:56 PM] insensless72#0000
thats 1 PP3


[09-Jan-22 07:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[10-Jan-22 02:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think this is a glitch? What does your workforce buffer look like for this new base?


[10-Jan-22 02:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
only concerned with the pioneer column in this case


[10-Jan-22 03:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also if you go to the production line details for your extractor, it should tell you the real, net efficiency that it is running at


[10-Jan-22 03:20 PM] colerror#0000
It's actually running at 44%. I'm hoping at the next upkeep, that some of those idiots realize they don't have a job. I'm guessing that the server automatically assigned some number of workers to you when you start the base, and during upkeep, it realizes it doesn't need all of them


[10-Jan-22 03:34 PM] colerror#0000
Seems like that's the deal, per official server


[10-Jan-22 05:01 PM] domicius#0000
Yeah, you get 200 pioneers but they leave before consuming anything


[10-Jan-22 05:12 PM] insensless72#0000
I have the last 4 RTA in production rn, but theyre 2 days out. I can fill that or someone else can if you can do it faster


[10-Jan-22 05:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
2 days is fine. It will take longer than that for RDEs anyways


[10-Jan-22 05:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have more KV on Nike if you have LDE


[10-Jan-22 05:14 PM] insensless72#0000
18 LDE currently


[10-Jan-22 06:00 PM] colerror#0000
Can anyone on Nike spare 10 OVE. I'm an idiot and forgot to pack some


[10-Jan-22 06:01 PM] colerror#0000
Or even 5 to get me through a couple days


[10-Jan-22 06:01 PM] spatial_piano#0000

Now is a good time for us to discuss the governor situation on Nike. I want it to be a member of our corporation, but I personally dont want to do it due to time commitment.

@colerror these are the rates in-corp for BFABs produced on Nike:
```BSE = 600 AIC
BBH = 800 AIC
BDE = 800 AIC
BTA = 500 AIC```


[16-Jan-22 05:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
5 BDE * 800 = 4000
5 BBH * 800 = 4000
5 BSE * 600 = 3000
2 BTA * 500 = 1000

Probably won't need for a couple days anyway, looking to move my CHP over, and needs to grab things like TRU, SEA, and consumables


[16-Jan-22 11:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 I think we are ready for the ADM if you are ready to supply LDE


[17-Jan-22 02:41 AM] dasefx1#0000
ok, only I don't have lde on nike, I need to move it


[17-Jan-22 11:12 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Hm. I have 6 LDE on Nike, but I dont have any NL to make more.


[17-Jan-22 11:13 AM] insensless72#0000
I have 14 LDE on Nike but also no NL


[17-Jan-22 11:14 AM] colerror#0000
Only need 10 LDE to complete the ADM


[17-Jan-22 11:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ok so we have the items to finish it now. I suppose we should organize the consumables to avoid a rush.


[17-Jan-22 11:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they are stocked already for a week or more.


[17-Jan-22 11:16 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror do you want the election to start now?


[17-Jan-22 11:17 AM] colerror#0000
Doesn't matter to me. We have upkeep set for a bit at least, and elections will take a little while


[17-Jan-22 11:18 AM] dasefx1#0000
I can bring LDE tomorrow uk morning üòâ

@dasefx1 is Nutrien getting any sales at 8000 per shipload?


[17-Jan-22 11:42 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 are you getting any sales at 8k per ship?

[17-Jan-22 11:45 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Nutrien and insensless supply more than me, I have 4 EXT. If you both want, we could lower the price to 7500 in an attempt to get more sales volume


[17-Jan-22 11:45 AM] dasefx1#0000
for me we can lower price üôÇ


[17-Jan-22 11:45 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but I dont want to push the decision too much since I have lower stake here


[17-Jan-22 11:46 AM] dasefx1#0000
very small profit on LST is even 10 p/u üôÇ so all above is fine üòõ


[17-Jan-22 11:47 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
7500 per ship is about 41/u, which is basically SIO price on Phobos


[17-Jan-22 11:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I guess 7000 per ship for 38/u is closer to SIO


[17-Jan-22 11:50 AM] dasefx1#0000
7k looks good üôÇ @insensless72 what do you think ?


[17-Jan-22 11:50 AM] dasefx1#0000
nutrien can join with price change after ads end up, as he had 11k space


[17-Jan-22 11:50 AM] insensless72#0000
Lets drop it when these end, bottom line we need to move it


[17-Jan-22 11:50 AM] dasefx1#0000
okej üôÇ


[19-Jan-22 11:45 AM] domicius#0000

What's the going rate for Lfabs,  specifically LDE/LSE? Got some expansion plans i need to come up with ballpark figures for.


[21-Jan-22 09:15 AM] insensless72#0000
How many are you looking for? I have LDE and LSE


[21-Jan-22 09:15 AM] insensless72#0000
Both are going to be pricey with NL and PG prices


[21-Jan-22 09:19 AM] namthorn#0000
Would be 16 LDE, 10 LSE in total. The PG I can help out with though. And it's not an immediate thing, probably for in a few weeks time at the earliest.


[21-Jan-22 09:20 AM] namthorn#0000
getting a lab up and running


[21-Jan-22 09:23 AM] insensless72#0000
The LSE and LDE I have now I can let go of at 3800ea I have 14 LDE and 15 LSE


[21-Jan-22 09:26 AM] namthorn#0000
cool, thanks. i'll take that as the rough price and let you know when i'm close to having enough for the lot and we can talk specifics then.


[21-Jan-22 09:27 AM] insensless72#0000
PG cheaper than 18ea would lower the LSE price but im having a hard time finding NL below 2kea


[21-Jan-22 09:29 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I have a fresh batch of NL if you want. 1600/u


[21-Jan-22 09:29 AM] insensless72#0000
Nice! Yes please

I'll be going to Nike tomorrow, I can bring the following:

- 70 AL
- 241 SEA
- 200 OVE
- 1k MCG
Obviously this will all not fit into a ship, so I'll bring what will be requested. Let me know if interested in any item


[22-Jan-22 05:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kharadan i buy all of these things for my Nike base but im short on cash as usual.

[29-Jan-22 01:05 PM] insensless72#0000
CORPFIN in a new buffer


[29-Jan-22 01:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This 22k in CORPFIN is from share buyins


[29-Jan-22 01:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
a total of 22 players have bought in at 1000 AIC, but 2 deleted and 2 more are likely on the way out. So it would end up 18 players with 22k


[29-Jan-22 01:09 PM] insensless72#0000
As of now though 5% of 22k would be 1100


[29-Jan-22 01:09 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, we can't currently touch that money

I'll be making an LST run Deimos <-> Nike in coming days. I can bring you:
- 40 AL
- 300 SEA
- 1k PE
- 50 EXO
- 50 OVE
- 400 RAT
- 400 DW

Let me know if you're interested in any of these


[30-Jan-22 11:30 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kharadan I will be in the market for 5000 PE soon


[30-Jan-22 11:30 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
within 24 hours I think I will want to buy it


[30-Jan-22 11:31 AM] kharadan#0000

We should be getting tax money today or tomorrow, and I know we'll be needing DW and RAT on Nike. If you want to bring some amount of those less than or equal to your dividend at market rate, that would be swell


[30-Jan-22 12:42 PM] kharadan#0000
I'll bring that, np
also I have 1k PE sitting in WAR there, if Nike would have some use for that, I can donate


[30-Jan-22 02:53 PM] colerror#0000
Right now, we go through about 108 PE every 10 days


[30-Jan-22 02:53 PM] colerror#0000
And it looks like @dasefx1 put in the PE/MCG for the next upkeep already


[30-Jan-22 03:26 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I provided STR for the Infimary. Do we have sort sort of system for organizing the upkeep for Nike?


[30-Jan-22 03:38 PM] colerror#0000
If you let me know what you've provided, I'll mark it on the ledger. We don't have a good system yet (I'm partially waiting to see what tax revenue looks like), but I'll let you know when we have it

[03-Feb-22 01:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Im out of time as always, but if somebody wanted to do a quick market analysis on LST, MCG, FLX, etc. It could help us predict what is going on here


[03-Feb-22 01:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If there is an unusual circumstance developing, We want to be ahead of FIO, ANTS, etc. I am seeing some smart players accumulate LST now which makes me skeptical.

He is buying me out also


[03-Feb-22 01:48 PM] dasefx1#0000
I had 9 PP2 and doing only BSE and using 125 LST daily


[03-Feb-22 01:49 PM] dasefx1#0000
so if he do similar he should buy almost every day


[03-Feb-22 01:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
True. I should add BSE to that list of market analysis items.

[03-Feb-22 01:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Even if we have nothing to worry about from an LST market maker perspecitve, we could predict Invictus building a shit load of BSE

Thanks @namthorn , this is helpful.

all what MAD will sell he will provide for ANT area expansion

ah k, i assumed the sell he had up was just his leftovers from all the bases he had liquidated


[03-Feb-22 01:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
700 if I remember he had from liqiudate


[03-Feb-22 01:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
and 200 he bought as he expect he will increase price


[03-Feb-22 01:53 PM] dasefx1#0000
but price go down quick


[03-Feb-22 01:53 PM] namthorn#0000
that checks out then, was ~320 bought out

maybe yes üòâ


[03-Feb-22 01:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
One thing that could disrupt us is if they build 20+ EXT on Nike


[03-Feb-22 01:55 PM] namthorn#0000
that would be major overkill surely


[03-Feb-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Seems like there are better options currently, but it is a possibility


[03-Feb-22 01:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
even 10 EXT would be competition, but we would still be the largest.


[03-Feb-22 01:55 PM] dasefx1#0000
if you keep price fair, than we shouldnt expect competition üôÇ


[03-Feb-22 01:56 PM] dasefx1#0000
same with all products, like H, when I saw that price is 100 or higher, I set up own base, and others do same, than price go down to 55. I always think that if you sell too high price, you create competition üôÇ


[03-Feb-22 01:56 PM] namthorn#0000
yea even if there was, you guys have the 10% boost on nike so you'd still have an edge


[03-Feb-22 01:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@dasefx1 this is all true, but sometimes it is tempting to be super greedy space capitalists


[03-Feb-22 01:58 PM] dasefx1#0000
heh I know üôÇ


[03-Feb-22 01:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
No need for drastic action haha


[03-Feb-22 01:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can keep prices at 7k until we get really close to zero inventory


[03-Feb-22 01:59 PM] namthorn#0000
naturally, as inventory dwindles i'd expect prices to rise if demand stays constant


[03-Feb-22 02:00 PM] namthorn#0000
it is a ridiculously good price


[03-Feb-22 02:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Its a bit weird because we can fix prices on LST with our current situation. That is the pretext for most of these nike limestone discussions.


[03-Feb-22 02:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
at some price point we drive business off planet though


[03-Feb-22 02:02 PM] namthorn#0000
mmm, I don't think it's a major concern atm. as yaro said if you were price-gouging you might see a lot of folk entering the market


[03-Feb-22 02:03 PM] namthorn#0000
but i think most big efforts are focused on phobos & electronics atm


[03-Feb-22 02:04 PM] namthorn#0000
that and plans for a shared corp hq on griffonstone


[03-Feb-22 02:04 PM] namthorn#0000
that could be it actually. how lst intensive was it to build the one on nike?


[03-Feb-22 02:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Not bad at all for LST. The biggest limit was EPO, KV, and the electronics elements which were all provided by yaro


[03-Feb-22 02:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
something like 6000 EPO total


[03-Feb-22 02:09 PM] namthorn#0000
yeesh


[03-Feb-22 02:10 PM] namthorn#0000
that's like, a month's worth for my 4 pols 0.o


[03-Feb-22 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea even with my 8+ it was very precarious, since any EPO at all would cut heavily into PG time, and PG was providing operating cash haha


[03-Feb-22 02:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Who is building this HQ? maybe we could sell them stuff


[03-Feb-22 02:16 PM] namthorn#0000
that's a good point, I think PiBoy was looking for R-fabs. Was ANTS/FIO members discussing it.


[03-Feb-22 02:16 PM] namthorn#0000

[03-Feb-22 02:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
*immediately builds PP3*


[03-Feb-22 02:19 PM] namthorn#0000
hah, yea could be a good deal, haven't seen any more traction in the planet chat since the initial discussions so might be worth inquiring first.


[03-Feb-22 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thanks again. I actually did not build the PP3 yet, probably in 1-2 days when I manage to transfer EPO over

[03-Feb-22 02:23 PM] namthorn#0000

[04-Feb-22 06:39 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@everyone Sorry for using the everyone ping, this message is for anyone with a nike base. Since we are all probably mining LST and BOR, I just have a question for everyone. I plan on mining LST and selling on CX but I can't sell it to the market maker and have to go through the buyer requests first. I see some of you guys have also setup buyer and seller requests as well. Basically I just wanted to ask is how to deal with the LST market. Because I'm force to sell to the buyer requests which means I will also be under cutting everyone. Should I just post a ad on nike instead or any other suggestions?


[04-Feb-22 06:42 PM] insensless72#0000
Feel free to post your LST below value, itll sell in a day or 2 and be right back to our next offer. You could post on LM but without large scale production you would probably do better on market


[04-Feb-22 06:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Our policy is to sell full shiploads on Nike for 7k currently


[04-Feb-22 06:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
on the CX, its every seller for themselves üòÜ


[04-Feb-22 06:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I try not to undercut corp members on the CX but it doesnt matter really for small volumes like 1 shipload worth


[04-Feb-22 06:46 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see, I will also try to follow the corps policy. Thanks for the info


[04-Feb-22 06:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You dont need to sell on Nike. If you are willing to do the shipping yourself, which it sounds like you already are, then try to get the best price possible for yourself on the CX


[04-Feb-22 06:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
limestone on the CX has added value compared to limestone on Nike. You should get a premium over our corporate cost if you are shipping it to market.


[04-Feb-22 06:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Then there is the whole issue of whether you want to accept a standing buy, or make a sell offer and wait. Thats personal preference and normally comes down to time sensitivity


[04-Feb-22 06:52 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Right, if I wait a little then I might make slightly better profits but then I guess I have to think about price range. Hmmm I probably will just post a ad on nike with the same sell price as everyone else


[04-Feb-22 06:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Totally up to you. Note that our LST price is very low compared to CX rates. We all sell on Nike because we are not capable of shipping it all ourselves. LST is too heavy.


[04-Feb-22 06:55 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Right, I could load up to about 180 but that was it. Maybe in the future we will have ships that have a bigger cargohold


[04-Feb-22 06:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea they are in production now


[04-Feb-22 06:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
super expensive though.


[04-Feb-22 06:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Those offers on Nike LM are all 183 LST because that is the max. its like 499.9 tons of limestone


[04-Feb-22 06:58 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Oh that is why everyone does 183, makes sense because that is all a basic ship could carry


[04-Feb-22 06:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
exactly.


[04-Feb-22 06:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you are willing to ship it though, you can pretty much get double price on the CX (or higher sometimes)


[04-Feb-22 07:02 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Yeah just sold at CX, with 183 LST I got around 14000 AIC. Your pretty much correct


[05-Feb-22 03:31 PM] allocater#0000
hi, I heard you need a food base on Nike. I have 1 free permit and would build one. Or does it make more sense to build one on Deimos?

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05-Feb-22 04:45 PM] insensless72#0000
We more or less need more food for all members in corp. Expanding your consumable production on Harmonia with it might make more sense if your going to make more consumables with it anyway


[05-Feb-22 06:01 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
harmonia would be most efficient i think


[05-Feb-22 08:26 PM] insensless72#0000
Buying MCG on Nike 500 if possible


[06-Feb-22 12:58 AM] allocater#0000
Ok, if there is overall food need, I can expand on a temperate planet. But I rather specialize Harmonia into farming and have another 500 base, than mixHarmonia +250


[06-Feb-22 01:16 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater I see your point about wanting to focus agriculture on Harmonia. In this case, consider Deimos since we plan to import agriculture products there


[06-Feb-22 01:17 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also, Nike is a good option because of our +10% bonus from the corporate HQ, and the consumable demand there.


[06-Feb-22 01:17 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Specializing agriculture on Harmonia will be very efficient, so there is no harm in pushing the FP to a different base.


[06-Feb-22 03:52 AM] kharadan#0000
I can get you 200 on Monday.
For more I'd need to wait for LST shipment, so the rest could be maybe Wednesday


[06-Feb-22 04:02 AM] allocater#0000
mh, tough decision. I am leaning towards Deimos now, because it's the gateway to Harmonia anyway, closer to the exchange and doesn't require SEA. I will fill up Harmonia with FRM for now, since that is viable in either case.


[06-Feb-22 10:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
@allocater I'll be starting up a carbon base on Deimos soon, once I do could I get you to make some HCP to bring over to Deimos with the other agricultural goods for your FP base? I can lend a ship from time to time to help with shipping logistics


[06-Feb-22 10:59 AM] insensless72#0000
@spatial_piano Do you have NL available?


[06-Feb-22 11:24 AM] allocater#0000

[07-Feb-22 01:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kharadan you can rent a warehouse on Nike to store them, right? Also, I would buy all 107 AL if they are already on planet


[07-Feb-22 01:23 PM] kharadan#0000
but only one unit, which was not enough...


[07-Feb-22 01:23 PM] kharadan#0000
but allocater is holding it for me now


[07-Feb-22 01:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ill buy them if you are ever in a position to sell it, however you would like to organize it


[07-Feb-22 01:26 PM] kharadan#0000
the idea was to  provide supply for my PP2s, they'll eat through it once they are built


[07-Feb-22 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah, that makes sense. Keep it then!


[07-Feb-22 01:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@Nike@Deimos  I am looking to buy 185 AL and up to 10k PE on Nike.


[07-Feb-22 01:30 PM] kharadan#0000
I can get you 7k PE tomorrow 5/u


[07-Feb-22 01:32 PM] artokun#0000
i only have 106AL


[07-Feb-22 02:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kharadan @artokun Both of those sound good. I am willing to wait up to 2 days for the AL, but I would also buy partial shiploads.


[07-Feb-22 02:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Whatever works best.


[07-Feb-22 02:07 PM] kharadan#0000
@artokun if you don't have a convenient flight to Nike, I can ship the AL for you together with PE
leaving today or tomorrow


[07-Feb-22 02:15 PM] namthorn#0000
i'll have a full ship of 185 i can send over tomorrow


[07-Feb-22 02:15 PM] namthorn#0000
just out on a FEO run atm with my closest ship


[07-Feb-22 03:42 PM] insensless72#0000
Does anyone have 2 BTA they can sell me on Nike?


[07-Feb-22 04:08 PM] allocater#0000
yes, it's already in my construction pile, create the request, I'll just order it again from @bitcoin_ape üòÖ


[07-Feb-22 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Lets hold off on that, I asked him and he sold all he has. I dont want you to be short on what you need

@Nike There seems to be a Limestone shortage and we have lost some extractors. There are buyers waiting, we can probably go to 7300+ AIC per shipload

I spammed Nike with longterm supply contracts in case there is interest in something like that, the longer you can wait the cheaper it gets


[16-Feb-22 02:09 AM] domicius#0000
Well, yes, I am interested in a long term supply contract... As i save up enough to build a CLR and some more fireplaces


[16-Feb-22 04:13 AM] allocater#0000
any of the existing caught your fancy or do you have a custom one in mind?


[16-Feb-22 04:18 AM] domicius#0000
Im not on Nike coms (not an owner) so just run one past me. Essentially, I use around 80-100 LST per day to make MCG so anything around that would be great. Happy to sort out the NIKE-PHOBOS shipping myself@allocater


[16-Feb-22 04:19 AM] allocater#0000

[16-Feb-22 04:21 AM] domicius#0000
Its probably a bit hard for me to take it from Nike as I'm using my WAR continuously to ship LST

Hello I will have a ship on phobos in 20 hours. I will have about 150 tons or  180 m¬≥ to take on more shipping orders. I will be taking them to Nike. I will bring some DW and Carbon to sell to you all.

I relisted LSE for 3000/u, seems more fair considering the current prices


[17-Feb-22 10:23 AM] kharadan#0000
I have 36 LST, but if I give them to you, it will delay the contract we have for whole shipload


[17-Feb-22 11:00 AM] cazertanu#0000
Hi I plan to buy 4 LSE $8000, 4 LDE $12000, 4 LTA $8000. Are these prices in line with your costs?


[17-Feb-22 11:06 AM] dasefx1#0000
I reduced fabs production a lot after nutrien quit, as he supply me a lot, so maybe @bitcoin_ape @insensless72


[17-Feb-22 11:07 AM] dasefx1#0000
LTA I can help but on phobos and 1500 p/u


[17-Feb-22 11:08 AM] allocater#0000
phobos LTA is listed,
what did he supply? maybe I can take over


[17-Feb-22 11:33 AM] dasefx1#0000
LTA on phobos only 5 I had


[17-Feb-22 11:37 AM] dasefx1#0000
@allocater it will be hard. On phobos, he had 20 POL making PG, 5WPL making NL, 3LAB and 2 CHP making TCL for KV and THF, plus 5 REF,  2 PHF,On deimos 20 SME making AL on, plus 7EXT, 3COL 12INC, on harmonia 54 RIG and 17FP making DW, on nike 8 EXT 4PP1 for BDE and 3CHP


[17-Feb-22 11:37 AM] dasefx1#0000
so after he quit, he left me and gazprom with this gap


[17-Feb-22 11:38 AM] allocater#0000
oh crap I was thinking like C and PG üòÖ


[17-Feb-22 11:38 AM] dasefx1#0000

I want to buy a further 4 LSE. Does $8000 work or do you need a better price?


[19-Feb-22 11:47 AM] insensless72#0000
The PG alone cost more than 2k each for me


[19-Feb-22 11:48 AM] insensless72#0000
the cheapest i could go would be 3k each right now


[19-Feb-22 11:48 AM] insensless72#0000
12k / 4


[19-Feb-22 11:49 AM] cazertanu#0000
$12000 for 4 LSE is a deal

LDE 21 3000

I have to wind down some debt first, but midterm I am interested in 
4 LBH
6 LDE
8 LSE
2 LTA


[23-Feb-22 03:23 PM] kharadan#0000
what's the demand for Lfabs?
I never got to making them in bulk, because it didn't look like I can sell many of them, but maybe I'm wrong...


[23-Feb-22 04:18 PM] insensless72#0000
Demand for lfabs in corp is pretty low (except for when members expand rapidly.) After that though they really only needed for upkeep or rfabs. I havent sold any on the market in awhile as I usualyl hold them for corp use so I cant really speak as to how fast they sell on the market.


[23-Feb-22 04:18 PM] insensless72#0000
Expanding into lfabs wouldnt be a bad move for you though since you produce your own PE and can buy the other components cheap in corp local on Nike


[23-Feb-22 04:19 PM] insensless72#0000
They take a ton of AL though so be warned


[23-Feb-22 04:46 PM] dasefx1#0000
A lot of lfabs is needed for hq upgrades


[23-Feb-22 04:50 PM] insensless72#0000
^^


[23-Feb-22 04:51 PM] insensless72#0000
How many levels up can HQ go?


[23-Feb-22 09:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Expense is the main limit


[23-Feb-22 09:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I dont know if there is a maximum HQ level, but the fabs required would not be worth it...


[23-Feb-22 09:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
3 bases is bad enough üòÜ

LM or ANT?


[03-Mar-22 04:32 PM] kharadan#0000
I was thinking more of LM


[03-Mar-22 04:33 PM] insensless72#0000
Yeah i feel like that was always going to happen. I feel like the problem more is lack of demand


[03-Mar-22 04:33 PM] insensless72#0000
Its not selling fast on market either


[03-Mar-22 04:39 PM] kharadan#0000
Not sure how demand changed. I was suspecting that after time when there was not much LST, too many people made plans to produce it. And now there's too many producers


[03-Mar-22 05:07 PM] insensless72#0000
There has not been a new rush of players in some time now. Which means that bfabs are not in high demand currently. just a couple weeks ago there was no one in corp with enough to post on LM


[03-Mar-22 05:09 PM] insensless72#0000
LST is also essentially a side effect of having a base on Nike with the HQ. probably shouldnt be relied upon as a major source of income but is a nice counter balance to consumable costs


[05-Mar-22 12:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@Nike I think @insensless72 is right here. We would do well to lower our LST sale price.


[05-Mar-22 12:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I propose that we reduce it back to 7k


[05-Mar-22 06:04 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see, maybe it's because everyone is stock up. I have about 1k LST right now, selling them at 7k will probably win us more favor and accepted offers. I'm all for it


[05-Mar-22 06:18 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@dasefx1 Hey yaro, I believe you have 200 SEA at nike right, the total would be 15k. Can I post a buy AD for them?

You'll need SEA for each building, like MCG


[11-Mar-22 11:38 AM] yjhasaday#0000

Hi guys, I have both my ships on Nike leaving in a couple hours - one is half full and going to ANT CX, the other is empty and going to Deimos. Let me know if you want anything shipped in either of these directions!

Yep, I'm going to do that if no one else wants the space. I'll buy a full shipload and split it between CX and Deimos (since I only have half a ship of space to CX)

[18-Mar-22 04:54 PM] spatial_piano#0000
for the rfabs


[18-Mar-22 04:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
insensless prices are 10k for rse, 7k rbh


[18-Mar-22 04:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i think i have sold yaro rde at 12k, but we could probably come down to 11k on these


[18-Mar-22 04:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also i see i have 1 leftover RDE on phobos, this is also for sale


[18-Mar-22 04:58 PM] spatial_piano#0000
My priority is speed currently. I want to get the SPF running this weekend.


[18-Mar-22 04:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah right


[18-Mar-22 04:59 PM] spatial_piano#0000
So I gues we can start wit the 2 RBH@14000?


[18-Mar-22 05:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, I can get all of this on Phobos for you within 24 hours


[18-Mar-22 05:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also buy 1 RDE from me at 11k


[18-Mar-22 05:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[18-Mar-22 05:00 PM] spatial_piano#0000

It's Winged Victory of Samothrace, or the Nike of Samothrace, an ancient greek sculpture. Unfortunately its marble and not limestone.

Nike means victory in greek.

Sorry, didn't see this until now but yes, its almost at Nike now. Next time!


[13-Apr-22 11:32 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Hey @Nike, does anyone ever switch their EXT to BOR instead of LST? I would be willing to pay well for any BOR on Nike - also might help alleviate LST over-supply when necessary? I know its really slow so I understand if no one wants to do it but thought I would ask!


[13-Apr-22 11:35 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have done a few back-burner EXT jobs to collect BOR for my AML to make BOS for ships. It is terribly slow, but the value of the ship is so high that its worth it. So far I have made 60 BOS this way


[13-Apr-22 11:37 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can pass you some BOR now if you want to get started with your NAB. I have 40 BOR I can sell you without slowing down ship production at all.


[13-Apr-22 11:40 AM] yjhasaday#0000
That would be great! What is the price?


[13-Apr-22 11:43 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if I sell LST for 32 on planet, but the BOR is 10.5x harder to extract, that implies its worth 336 each. This honestly sucks though, i dont want to sell it at that price.


[13-Apr-22 11:43 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
how about 200 each? I already wrote off the extraction time as a loss


[13-Apr-22 11:45 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Nah its fine, even paying 336 its still profitable at NAB end product, then I can make even more when it becomes fuel

@Nike In 40h a player from Nemesis will sell 185 SCR on ANT CX. I posted a buy order for 100 SCR. If you too want SCR, post your buy orders. Else he will sell the excess to the MM.


[20-Apr-22 04:31 PM] yang_mills#0000
SCR->S->SEA.


[20-Apr-22 04:31 PM] yang_mills#0000
1 SCR -> 6S -> 180 SEA.

[21-Apr-22 12:46 PM] namthorn#0000
also could i requisition some pp3 time at some point in the next couple of weeks? i have 3 TCS i'd like to turn into HSEs to expand my LI mining operation. Happy to pay for the LSE + pp3 time.


[21-Apr-22 02:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
I would buy 400 SF on Nike. @yjhasaday, do you have it?


[21-Apr-22 02:42 PM] insensless72#0000
I have rfabs for days so you can use my PP3


[21-Apr-22 02:44 PM] namthorn#0000
awesome that would be great thanks, put up a buy for the 3 tcs at 1 and i'll hand em over.

60 FIM on Nike for sale 800ea


[23-Apr-22 11:45 AM] yang_mills#0000
@Nike I have 168 SCR in reserve. 1 SCR corresponds to 180 SEA. If you need SCR, I can sell some to you at 100AIC/u. That's the price for which I bought it.


[23-Apr-22 01:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I need PE on Nike... I dont suppose anyone has PE available?


[23-Apr-22 01:23 PM] insensless72#0000
How much are you looking for?


[23-Apr-22 04:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
up to 50k


[23-Apr-22 04:56 PM] mitlof#0000
I've got the 1000 PE of the constructor package, but I built PP2 so i don't think I need it


[23-Apr-22 05:10 PM] namthorn#0000
ye that PE is for if you make the standard PP1 to make BDEs


[23-Apr-22 05:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ooh, ill pay 6900 for it if you dont mind


[23-Apr-22 06:04 PM] domicius#0000
I can run 2k PE for you to Nike, and make more if you want.


[23-Apr-22 06:06 PM] domicius#0000
Or if you can wait, I can switch to full PE production


[23-Apr-22 06:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
permanent PE on Nike would be great for BDE and INS

Hello, Mitlof! Welcome to our Discord channel!


[23-Apr-22 07:36 PM] domicius#0000
Eh, I'm always coming over for LST. I can build some more MFGs, or I suppose a new base and shift all my many there and do just SW on phobos


[23-Apr-22 07:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
@mitlof has a WEL on Nike. Perhaps our corp could find a good use for it.


[23-Apr-22 11:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yang_mills did anyone agree to process SCR for you? I have 100 SI and 3k PG that can be used for producing SEA on Nike.


[24-Apr-22 06:42 AM] yang_mills#0000
I can process SCR myself. It's done in SME. I could also process your SCR. How much S do you need?

[24-Apr-22 08:30 AM] insensless72#0000
@namthorn HSE ready


[24-Apr-22 09:13 AM] yang_mills#0000
How expensive is HSE? Does one need only one per building? I fill like there is a need for a planet next to Harmonia specialized in food processing. You see, the farms take a lot of area, and one really wants to put as much as possible on Harmonia. Then perhaps one could have a second planet next to Harmonia with FP, and maybe INC.  There is ZV-896c in the same system. It has some O, but not much else otherwise. But it requires HSE. So I would like to know how bad is this.


[24-Apr-22 09:16 AM] allocater#0000
I agree, I have been dreaming of a FP planet for months, but there is only KW-020c


[24-Apr-22 09:17 AM] allocater#0000
HSE I am not an expert but I think 1 per building and 10k


[24-Apr-22 09:17 AM] insensless72#0000
The hardest part of HSE would be the TC I believe, LSEs and PP3 time are easy


[24-Apr-22 09:20 AM] allocater#0000
since shipping becomes easier with time, but extreme planet colonization not, it's probably worth it to look for empty temperate planet around ANT instead, like YK-649b or QJ-149c


[24-Apr-22 09:26 AM] yang_mills#0000
It's a bit of a waste to use QJ-149c for that. It could be a second AL planet. Perhaps QJ-684b could do the job. It requires SEA, but SEA is easy and I could produce tons of it.


[24-Apr-22 09:27 AM] yang_mills#0000
There is also LS-746b. A worthless temperate planet, but it's far away.


[24-Apr-22 09:28 AM] yang_mills#0000
LS-746b is only two jumps away from Harmonia, but 3 from Deimos and 4 from Phobos and Nike.


[24-Apr-22 09:29 AM] yang_mills#0000
Have to see how it works with the logistics.


[24-Apr-22 09:30 AM] allocater#0000
yup, I also like that its somewhat between ANT and BEN


[24-Apr-22 09:30 AM] allocater#0000
the jumps are pretty big though

[24-Apr-22 09:31 AM] yang_mills#0000
Oh, sorry, it's 2 jumps from Nike and 4 from Harmonia.


[24-Apr-22 09:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
It's close to Griffonstone.


[24-Apr-22 09:34 AM] yang_mills#0000
I full cargo hold can contain 5000 DW or 2380 RAT.


[24-Apr-22 09:35 AM] yang_mills#0000
So I guess that at big scales like that, the logistics is not too much of an issue.


[24-Apr-22 09:36 AM] allocater#0000
yeah and future ships will do 20000 DW


[24-Apr-22 09:37 AM] allocater#0000
the heavy crops and water for the import is the worse part


[24-Apr-22 09:39 AM] allocater#0000
but if distance becomes so meaningless, KW-020c can be used


[24-Apr-22 09:40 AM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, a full cargo can contain only 500 crops, and one can produce only 500/3 = 166 RAT out of it.


[24-Apr-22 09:40 AM] allocater#0000
times 10


[24-Apr-22 09:41 AM] yang_mills#0000
Oh, sorry. 10*500/3 = 1666 RAT.


[24-Apr-22 09:41 AM] yang_mills#0000
Not that bad.


[24-Apr-22 09:47 AM] yang_mills#0000
So which one is worse, a planet with very easy logistics, but which requires extra 10K per building + degradation, or a planet with no extra building costs but with much more complicated logistics (opportunity costs for ships + fuel costs)?


[24-Apr-22 09:48 AM] allocater#0000
good question üòÑ


[24-Apr-22 09:55 AM] yang_mills#0000
@spatial_piano @yjhasaday I posted an ad for SF on Nike. If the price is not high enough, let me know and I will change.

[24-Apr-22 01:56 PM] yang_mills#0000
Thank you @spatial_piano !


[24-Apr-22 02:16 PM] artokun#0000
re-posted ads for bfabs above corp rate here on Nike


[24-Apr-22 03:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
Wow! You ask for huge quantities. Don't have nearly as many in stock. I will build a couple more PP2. As @insensless72 suggested, we should prioritise the construction of PP2 to overcome our deficit of Bfabs.


[24-Apr-22 03:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea @artokun we cant manage this right now, and we need to prioritize the phobos wildlife park upgrade in the next 2 weeks


[24-Apr-22 03:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
its all from the new player rush, following our recent expansions. At least you got all those smelters in cheaply


[24-Apr-22 04:14 PM] artokun#0000
Ah, sounds good I‚Äôll get them from the exchange


[24-Apr-22 04:54 PM] insensless72#0000
9k for the LSE and youre good


[24-Apr-22 04:58 PM] insensless72#0000
I have 6 PP2s running =  15 BSE and BBH per day and 1 PP1 pushing BDEs. Ill keep corp up to date with how many fabs I have on hand


[24-Apr-22 05:13 PM] yang_mills#0000
I have 3 PP2s and 1 PP1. Soon will add a 4th PP2.


[25-Apr-22 10:52 AM] cazertanu#0000
I have afew bfab orders too. I'm trying to keep them small at 10 eaches


[25-Apr-22 10:53 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
since i adjusted my base this weekend i now have 4 PP2 on Nike at 143% eff.


[25-Apr-22 10:54 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also 1 PP1 on permanent BDE work, and 2 PP3 on insulation

[25-Apr-22 12:05 PM] allocater#0000
@Nike same question as in deimos, who has space for PP2 (and confidence that they can be kept supplied and running)? You can get interest-free loans, to buy all mats and build them today! ü•≥


[25-Apr-22 12:55 PM] yang_mills#0000
Built my 4th PP2 on Nike today.

{Reactions}
ü•≥ 

[25-Apr-22 12:57 PM] yang_mills#0000
I can further increase my  PP2 numbers and don't  need loans for that. However, AL is starting to be an issue.


[25-Apr-22 12:58 PM] allocater#0000
but AL can be bought with loans, should be profitable even at AL CX prices, or? and with loan you can build it earlier.


[25-Apr-22 12:59 PM] allocater#0000
but we are also expanding AL production


[25-Apr-22 01:01 PM] yang_mills#0000
I would rather do that. Increase my Al output on Deimos.


[25-Apr-22 01:02 PM] allocater#0000
let's go, how much you plan to build?


[25-Apr-22 01:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Im going to push 10 INC on harmonia roughly in time for insensless to ship build. I hope to support smelting with this


[25-Apr-22 01:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
I will add one more EXT and 2 SME on Deimos. This will be 3 EXT and 8 SME in total. I will also need to build an extra COL. And I will stop there. Because I want to save space for something else.


[25-Apr-22 01:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday how are you on fuel output on Nike? It would be great to fuel this new corp jet with slow fuel on Nike


[25-Apr-22 01:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
@yjhasaday has been out of reach for several days, since the last week.


[25-Apr-22 01:16 PM] allocater#0000
ok then you can get a 150k loan from the b-fab fund to build that faster with b-fabs from the exchange. sell 1 AL on deimos for 150k and I will accept.


[25-Apr-22 01:41 PM] allocater#0000
seems profit is heavily slated to PP2 still, even at AL price of 500


[25-Apr-22 01:41 PM] allocater#0000
so if we can keep them running, we should build more


[25-Apr-22 01:42 PM] yang_mills#0000
Don't need the loan. My construction mats will be ready sooner than my ship comes to Nike to pick them. My base expansion on Deimos should be ready done in 72h.

I am sending a ship from Deimos --> Nike in ~36 hrs. Looking to get a resupply of LST and hopefully BDE/BST if anyone has got some they can spare. I can send with me up to 360 SEA, 200 RAT, 200 DW, 100 OVE, 20 MED, 50 PWO, 60 AL, 6000 PE, and 4 NL to sell at corp prices if people are interested. This leaves around 140 t of space if anyone else needs something shipped over.


[27-Apr-22 01:59 AM] yang_mills#0000
I may prepare then a shipment. What's the price per 100t?

I agree, the LST must flow!


[03-May-22 06:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Well I didnt think it would happen but we appear to be low on LST supply on Nike. I have fabs if anyone wants to throw up some short term EXT


[03-May-22 06:06 PM] insensless72#0000
im down to 300 LST myself


[03-May-22 06:15 PM] yang_mills#0000
The local consumption of LST increased with people producing prefabs and MCG on Nike. But is this really a problem for our corporation? I prefer selling MCG and prefabs rather than producing a large surplus of LST.


[03-May-22 06:17 PM] insensless72#0000
Its not a problem at all, just an easy quick cash influx opportunity. We will easily surpass demand again soon


[03-May-22 06:24 PM] yang_mills#0000
I see. I would rather construct one extra BMP for MCG and one extra CHP for flux. Profits on those are also very good and it's much easier to ship.


[03-May-22 06:25 PM] insensless72#0000
^^^ Another opportunity for anyone interested


[03-May-22 06:27 PM] yang_mills#0000
Actually extracting LST is a very good cash opportunity for beginners. It's very easy, just build an EXT and let the money flow in.


[03-May-22 06:28 PM] yang_mills#0000
That's what I did first when I set up my base on Nike. Built 3 EXT.


[03-May-22 06:30 PM] yang_mills#0000
Then I evolved into producing products derived from LST: basic prefabs, FLX, MCG.


[03-May-22 06:35 PM] yang_mills#0000
Now the prices for LST are exceptionally high. Last time it was like that around the winter holidays.

Hey @Nike, how are we for Bfab production right now? Wasn't there a waitlist recently? I ask because I want to upgrade my HQ a couple times so I would be looking to place a rather large order (around 50 x BBH, 40 x BDE, 40 x BSE, 15 x BTA). Is now a good time?

there's a nice +10% production to whatever you do there

it stacks with the construction cogc, too ü§ë


[09-May-22 10:48 AM] namthorn#0000
also yea if you're doing construction then definitely. can BSE spam a lot harder shipping AL to Nike than shipping LST to deimos

owww


[09-May-22 10:49 AM] rune_242#0000
should i tear down my PP2's on deimos to make room for more SME


[09-May-22 10:49 AM] rune_242#0000
en ship all the AL to nike?


[09-May-22 10:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes, that is the most efficient strategy


[09-May-22 10:49 AM] rune_242#0000
dammit!


[09-May-22 10:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you take a small hit while moving your PP2, but not that bad


[09-May-22 10:50 AM] rune_242#0000
just build a whole lot of PP2's


[09-May-22 10:50 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you only need 2 PP2 on Nike for every 3 on Deimos to get the same output


[09-May-22 10:51 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
since they will produce bfabs so quickly, whatever amount you lose by demolishing buildings will be quickly forgotten

[09-May-22 10:51 AM] rune_242#0000

[09-May-22 10:51 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also the LST situation.. its pretty much ideal


[09-May-22 10:52 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and like you said this makes room for more AL business on deimos. There is no better place to melt rocks


[09-May-22 11:31 AM] yang_mills#0000
It's the right time to build one. LST sells at 200 AIC/u on the CX. I could provide you cheaper MCG (15 AIC/u) and SEA (80 AIC/u) for that.  You can produce your own BSE in your PP2. But if you don't have enough I could sell you some at 600 AIC/u.


[09-May-22 11:47 AM] domicius#0000
Yeah, I'm moving there to make MCG. More cost effective to ship SIO rather than LST, really


[09-May-22 01:04 PM] allocater#0000
b-fabs still tight. I might build another b-fab base on deimos and then ship LST<->AL between the two


[09-May-22 02:37 PM] allocater#0000

[01-Jun-22 08:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@Nike My apologies for jacking up LST rates without communicating. I got the sense that some external players were taking too much advantage from our supply.


[01-Jun-22 08:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In corp rate is still 7000 per 183 LST, picked up on Nike. I think we can comfortably float this internally


[01-Jun-22 08:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
for the public prices, it seems like 12k is not moving so well. I am content to come back down to 8-9k in the long term


[01-Jun-22 08:56 PM] churavis#0000
I was certainly taking advantage of the cheap LST sales before I joined


[01-Jun-22 08:57 PM] insensless72#0000
Lets keep it 10k minimum, I sold 3 ships of LST today at 12k


[01-Jun-22 10:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah, thats why mine were not moving lol

So I've been thinking about expanding in AL production and some bfabs on Deimos to supply my never ending thirst for bfabs, but if the bfab producers here need more AL and don't mind selling me a lot of bfabs, I'm happy to do the smart thing and specialize


[29-Jun-22 12:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I just find myself growing quickly and don't want to take all the bfabs, so thought maybe I should make some, but I also see a lot of complaints about needing AL, so perhaps I could fill that niche


[29-Jun-22 12:42 PM] jackinabox86#0000
or even just ALO on Deimos to fill someone else's AL line

@OOG Shareholder I need to announce that I will be less active moving forward. Many of you have likely already noticed that I respond slowly, and am not present as much these days.

I want you all to know that I am not quitting the game, and do not plan to. Besides, I am simply too proud of OOG to leave.

The fact is that I have assumed more responsibility at my real life job, and now need to work more, and have less free time/mental capacity to be "ahead of the game" as I have been for so long.

The good news is that this has happened at a time when OOG is larger, more active, and more productive than ever. Aside from my bank, and considerable inventory/key production lines, you guys dont need me that much.


[06-Jul-22 07:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will still be here, I will still proivide PG and free AML services for ship building

also this money... I do not want it to stagnate, but also I feel satsified in the recent investments we have made, and 4-6 month commitments to shipbuilding. All of this is still "a go" and I wil lcontinue to finance our ship building from the bank

hoping to build a base on Nike, so posted ads for 46 bse, 55 bbh, 50 bde, 24 lbh, and 5 lde.  I also posted for 229 SEA and 774 MCG, but know I may need to go elsewhere for those.  I need 41 TRU, but I think we're out in corp?  Happy to adjust prices, head to CX, etc. on all these

You can just pay the corp price, particularly since you're newer.  Some of our long-term players may pay a bit extra to help out new folks, but there's no reason for you to spend extra capital on higher prices; we'd prefer you expand faster and contribute more in the future as a result

maybe for some things, but I think most bfabs get used for expansion by members, which we really want to encourage


[12-Aug-22 06:46 PM] insensless72#0000
All currency spent in corp stays in corp, products sold outside of corp bring in currency to boost corp


[12-Aug-22 06:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
I borrowed CIA money from the members of our company to buy DW, and then paid back the CIA's arrears through the profits of building prefabricated parts purchased at the company's internal price in CI, and then sold DW at the company's internal price.


[12-Aug-22 06:51 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Basically, we don‚Äôt buy in corp for resale. You can produce things you sell, but don‚Äôt just take someone else‚Äôs profit for yourself. They can sell on the CX for themselves

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[12-Aug-22 06:52 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If you want to borrow money to buy and sell on the cx, that‚Äôs fine. Just don‚Äôt buy corp produced mats (unless you confirmed that‚Äôs ok with the producer) and sell at the CX


[12-Aug-22 06:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
If this kind of behavior is not encouraged, I can compensate for the difference between the internal price and CX price.


[12-Aug-22 06:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
The main reason is that my previous BSE and BBH stocks have been bought CI, exchanged for RAT and DW, and shipped to benten to buy back PE and INS.

[12-Aug-22 06:58 PM] insensless72#0000
It also kind of depends on the product to be honest. LST for example you can have as much as you want to take to any market. Since fabs are used to fuel corporate growth its best they stay internal


[12-Aug-22 07:01 PM] churavis#0000
Also I kind of cleaned out a ton of Allocater's bfabs and lfabs for my new Nike base and he's the one that produces and stocks the most fabs so there might be a bit of a shortage at the moment. Eventually it will result in more fabs for the corp but the production for the first week or so will be dedicated to my other expansions as well as repairs for my aging bases.


[12-Aug-22 07:03 PM] yuen8241#0000
OK, I bought 113 BSE and 100 BBH internally. I will produce so many and sell them at the internal price later. So I borrowed these this time.


[12-Aug-22 07:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now that my stock of materials is full, the production line is running at full capacity.


[12-Aug-22 07:08 PM] yuen8241#0000
It's mainly because I'm new here. If there are any other things I may violate, I hope you can point them out for me. In addition, I would like to ask, is my main task to expand production capacity?


[12-Aug-22 07:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
Is it that I am encouraged to buy fabs and other things we urgently need from cx at a price lower than or equal to the internal price and then ship them back to sell them at the internal price?

Thats exactly what the 7 day trial for for so no worries at all. Your main task is to enjoy playing. We dont have "requirements" for members. The best way to help and contribute is to find something that people need in corp or a gap in supply chain. The more things can do or produce as a corp makes us all better off

[12-Aug-22 10:17 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Sometimes there is trading that can bring in something from far away, like HE when that was nonexistent. But generally, we produce enough to meet our needs for mats at corp price and don‚Äôt expect anyone to acquire that elsewhere and bring it here


[12-Aug-22 10:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
That is to say, we are more inclined to be self-sufficient than to accumulate more money through cx?


[12-Aug-22 10:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
That's right. If we want to build a ship, we need a whole system to support it. Cx can't be trusted in this scenario.

@Nike Can anyone with LST stocks put up some sell ads (I'm too low to fill an ad right now)? Some rando is charging 16500 for a shipload and I don't like it! I want people who fly here to buy LST to know that we keep a stable price here for them. That price seems to fluctuate based on who posts, which is fine but lets try to keep it at around 10K so we hold on to those that come to buy our quality limestone üòé

ZLDR should have enough from what I hear, if you want some contracts done privately


[02-Sep-22 10:08 AM] churavis#0000
LST on the CX has been high so all the 10,000 contracts went super quick and most of it just went straight to the CX. I figured it would be better to just pay for transportation and help lower the CX price ourselves. I've tried to maintain a stockpile so there's plenty for corp members.


[02-Sep-22 10:09 AM] churavis#0000
10,000 for 183 is 54.64 each while the CX has been as high as 200 each


[02-Sep-22 10:20 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, thats fair. Lets settle on a new rate for 183 LST - 15K? (81.97/u)

Do we have enough FE on Nike to build a PP1 base to produce BSE+BBH?


[18-Sep-22 04:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
This production formula is inappropriate and unstable in Antares.


[18-Sep-22 04:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
The price of FE cx can easily reach over 500.


[18-Sep-22 04:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
The development cost of FE metallurgical link is high, and the transportation cost is high. Therefore, if the production is to be stable, the overall profit should be lower than that of PP2+Al.


[18-Sep-22 05:34 AM] allocater#0000
but FE is now reaching 350 and maybe in corp we can get it lower


[18-Sep-22 05:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
The trouble is that FE is too heavy. I calculated that compared with the AL formulaÔºåEvery 60 metals or soÔºåFE formula will earn 5k less in SME stage and 3K more in PP1 stage. The capacity consumption of FE is more than double.


[18-Sep-22 05:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
Perhaps the biggest advantage is the simple population demand.


[18-Sep-22 05:56 AM] allocater#0000
mh, yeah, maybe on deimos with STL FE


[18-Sep-22 08:08 AM] churavis#0000
I produce quite a bit of FE and STL but it never seems to be enough for the corp. I can't really justify selling it for less than 350 being that my Antares II b base requires HSE and a gas guzzling glass ship for transport that's only ever full on the way back.


[18-Sep-22 08:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think it's better to use steel on the blade. If we can use AL, why use FE?


[18-Sep-22 11:10 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I‚Äôm converting my full Nike base to construction and doing bse/Bbh. If there are supply issues, hopefully I can help with that. Also still have my 3 pp1 doing BDE

[18-Sep-22 12:13 PM] churavis#0000
The only reason LST is up in price is because we stopped letting newbs use our cheap LST to nuke the market


[18-Sep-22 01:45 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I make my own AL and you all seem to have LST covered.  I'll keep buying the occasional FE and STL off of you, if that works.  Most stuff is made with AL though in my plan

[06-Oct-22 02:20 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm going to turn around in a 3-4 days to start a Nike base. I will need input on how I can best help our production lines with that base.


[06-Oct-22 02:21 PM] jackinabox86#0000
max pp2s probably, but you'll want to make sure you have a source of AL first.  If you don't have a Deimos AL base, that might be even more helpful than the Nike base given how the rest of us churn through AL

To continue on this line of discussion - Nike needs techs and engineers. I haven't done the math myself so hopefully one of you can enlighten me on the best programs to run to address this issue as quickly as possible? Money/program costs are not an issue. I have education III running right now but I'm tempted to run tech or eng immigration if it is a better way to bring them in?

Do you want to expand your base to 750 or 1000?


[11-Oct-22 02:04 AM] exeler#0000
I don't currently have plans for it, this was just for a 500 base. 

I think I could make better use of my permits by doing a similar setup on Nascent for 500 area instead of 250 area on Harmonia.


[11-Oct-22 02:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
If two people cooperate, harmonia can produce about 75 C's a day on average.


[11-Oct-22 02:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you want to improve it again, you need nascent to burn crops and water from outside.

[12-Oct-22 02:16 AM] yuen8241#0000
My AL is so short that it is acceptable to build BSE, but it can't be maintained by building BBH. At present, the price of AL has also risen very high. The dismantling of SME to build ASM and the production of Ti have led to a sharp drop in AL production.üòÖ

{Reactions}
üòü 

[12-Oct-22 02:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
If I try my best to produce BBH, I will consume 140 AL a day, and my remaining sme will produce 60 at most a day, which will also cause the production of Ti to stop.


[12-Oct-22 02:24 AM] dehzhas#0000
I'm trying to get my AL base up as soon as I can, I just can't logistically support it yet


[12-Oct-22 02:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
Recently, several players who have left us have a large number of SME, PP2, PP3 and ASM. After they left, our capacity gap is quite large.


[12-Oct-22 02:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can give you FLX, and you should be able to purchase the rest yourself. If you have the harmonia base, you can solve the little C needed by the metallurgical industry yourself.


[12-Oct-22 02:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
As long as PG and PE are not produced, C in Antares area is enough.


[12-Oct-22 02:29 AM] dehzhas#0000
The main issue is I don't mine ALO yet. Which ... you would think I would since I have a base on Deimos... but it doesn't mine ALO. My plan has been going all in on consumables to play a supporting role, so my bases are all built out for consumables and the capacity is committed so I can't change the production.


[12-Oct-22 02:30 AM] dehzhas#0000
That said, I have a plan to get there... just will take a little time.


[12-Oct-22 02:30 AM] dehzhas#0000
Once I do, FLX would be great.


[12-Oct-22 02:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you set up a consumer goods base on a planet like deimos, it will seriously waste COGC bonus.

[12-Oct-22 02:35 AM] yuen8241#0000

[12-Oct-22 02:35 AM] yuen8241#0000

[13-Oct-22 08:40 PM] domicius#0000
I finally have a weekend to look at this, plus expand software on phobos.


[13-Oct-22 08:42 PM] churavis#0000
I always have extra shipping capacity coming off of Nike so getting extra LST to market isn't a problem


[13-Oct-22 08:43 PM] churavis#0000
DLR has 9 EXT and that has been barely not enough for corp needs


[13-Oct-22 08:43 PM] domicius#0000
Let me see how many I can set up.


[13-Oct-22 08:44 PM] domicius#0000
It's been a minute since I set something up, but extraction is easy

[18-Oct-22 02:15 PM] churavis#0000
We are short of UPF capacity


[18-Oct-22 02:16 PM] churavis#0000
Mostly it just depends on how much priority this holds over ship production


[18-Oct-22 02:16 PM] churavis#0000
I've got all the inputs needed


[18-Oct-22 02:17 PM] jackinabox86#0000
both you and Rodrix are doing UPFs?


[18-Oct-22 02:24 PM] churavis#0000
I built a UPF originally for building RDS and RDL to sell but I'm helping allocater out temporarily


[18-Oct-22 02:25 PM] churavis#0000
I thought I might have trouble keeping it occupied and so had HAB input ready for when I ran out of plastics

Nice.  Love not having shortages


[18-Oct-22 02:29 PM] jackinabox86#0000
are there many customers for RDS/RDL?  Pricey thing to produce, although probably not too bad for you with your PPF


[18-Oct-22 02:30 PM] rune_242#0000
I am about to build a base on hephaestus so that can be fixed


[18-Oct-22 02:38 PM] churavis#0000
It's all vertically integrated down until PG and pretty soon that too. I figure that with upgrades possible now people might be glad to add a damage reducer that doesn't increase repair cost or complexity but we'll see.


[18-Oct-22 02:39 PM] churavis#0000
Be sure to coordinate that with allocater, you'll need about 5 PPF to feed a UPF for ship components


[18-Oct-22 02:40 PM] rune_242#0000
are short on that too?


[18-Oct-22 02:42 PM] churavis#0000

[18-Oct-22 09:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'm similar to you. Consider producing some FIM yourself. Just a little DDT


[18-Oct-22 10:21 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I did, but the HER takes a lot and I don‚Äôt really want to dedicate two permits to it. If necessary, I will. It‚Äôs a bit chunk of my costs

[18-Oct-22 10:31 PM] archielvahr#0000

At this point, I'm planning on setting up a base on Demeter almost purely devoted to growing HER. On that note as well, if anyone needs DDT, I have plenty


[19-Oct-22 01:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
Demeter is too far away. We have built so many ships, but there is no scheduled flight.  HER And DDT are very light, so demeter is very suitable for production.

I was going to start doing HER on Harmonia, so that I could make FIM (which we never have enough of). Maybe we could consider a swap? I didn't realise how time consuming HER is.

The current CX price of LST can sell for 160, so the internal price I offer is 80.üòÜ  In the past, DLR provided LST in large quantities and cheaply.

LST is different from h, LST is relatively closer to CX, and it is more convenient to consume in Nike.

220 FIM  for sale at 1200/u
200 COF @ 350/u


[26-Oct-22 09:28 AM] dehzhas#0000
FYI all: I'm going to be posting Ads on Nike selling consumables. These are intended for the general Nike residents and is the beginning of my efforts to provide regular and easy access to consumables around market rates. Feel free to accept them in a pinch, but I would rather OOG members contact me directly for regular deliveries at corp rates.

This is part of my bid to step in as Gov. next term, so I want Nike residents to get used to seeing fair priced consumables on the LM.

According to deimos, six SSTs should be enough, and nike doesn't need so many pioneers.


[28-Oct-22 10:39 PM] churavis#0000
I don't know that I would trust Bobemar on population infrastructure


[28-Oct-22 10:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
The problem with deimos is PAR and ART


[28-Oct-22 10:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think nike's main problem now is also this.


[28-Oct-22 10:40 PM] churavis#0000
It won't be in a week or two when the new infrastructure upgrades start to take effect


[28-Oct-22 10:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
The population size and structure of Heph is very similar to that of nike, with a total population of 50,000 and 30,000 pioneers, but only three SSTs. Etherwind, a planet with 130,000 pioneers, has only nine SSTs.


[28-Oct-22 10:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
Referring to heph, we need Grade 2 PAR and Grade 1 ART.


[28-Oct-22 10:45 PM] churavis#0000
Phobos had 6 and that didn't seem to be enough


[28-Oct-22 10:46 PM] churavis#0000
It also depends on whether you want to just give DW or rely on OFF and SUN as well


[28-Oct-22 10:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, heph's maintenance materials are basically of the highest standard.

[28-Oct-22 10:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
So, deimos's infrastructure and maintenance fee standards are very low.üòÖ


[28-Oct-22 10:51 PM] churavis#0000
The higher the building level the less you have to rely on the more expensive upkeep but each upgrade becomes exponentially more expensive


[28-Oct-22 11:21 PM] yuen8241#0000
Do the three maintenance products have the same impact?


[28-Oct-22 11:22 PM] churavis#0000
At full consumption, yes


[28-Oct-22 11:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
In that case, it is economically inappropriate to provide DW maintenance for SST.


[28-Oct-22 11:26 PM] churavis#0000
That depends on it's cost relative to OFF and SUN and to the extra upgrades you need if you want to only give partial upkeep for the same level of security


[28-Oct-22 11:29 PM] churavis#0000
Usually 150 DW is cheaper than 90 OFF or 90 SUN


[28-Oct-22 11:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
Will the new SST and PAR only take effect after the next population report?


[28-Oct-22 11:33 PM] churavis#0000
Yes

No, it definitely gets more expensive with each upgrade


[29-Oct-22 10:34 AM] yjhasaday#0000
It is set to max so we should see everything upgrade in 16 hours. I delivered the HAB for the PAR upgrade, will you get the other 5 in time?

If so Nike will gain the following in 16 hours:
2 levels to SST
1 level to INF
1 level to PAR
1 level to ART

BIG step forward torwards fixing our TECH/ENG problem! Cheers!

If only aceland could be changed into a new SME planet to produce AL.


[31-Oct-22 10:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
The increase of rat is not very big, mainly because Promitor's Rat production is too large, and other players and I have been buying it back from HRT.


[31-Oct-22 10:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
I suspect that DW's main producers have quit a few people, otherwise the gap wouldn't be so big.


[31-Oct-22 10:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
It may be that people are expanding their bases and increasing their DW consumption... but they aren't adding new DW production bases as quickly.

I don't have so much pe now. bmp often uses it for other things, so it's best to build an industrial chain by one person.

Nike's population gap is very strange. Is it that more than 10 PP4s have been built in a short time?


[01-Nov-22 10:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
With such a large quantity, all CX's are added together, and the trading volume in a week is not as large as that they produce in a day.


[01-Nov-22 10:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Seems like the employed engineer count has grown slowly. The extra 450 technician jobs could be PP3s (or other people like me with IVFs). Always possible they are SD buildings because people ran out of space on electronics planets üòõ


[01-Nov-22 10:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
The demand of technicians is understandable, but engineers are strange.


[01-Nov-22 10:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
If they use Nike as the SE planet, then I'd rather let them be dissatisfied.

I might start making PSL myself. I'm starting a base on Heph, so I could easily just toss a PPF or two on there. 

I just need some PSL to get started lol


[07-Nov-22 04:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Apparently if you want to rent two warehouses, you need a level 3 warehouse, so ads up for another 24 BBH, 24 BDE, 12 BSE


[07-Nov-22 04:02 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, all the even levels just increase the number of unique players who can rent a warehouse. It's a bottleneck you rarely hit so I'm not even sure why it's there.


[07-Nov-22 04:10 PM] exeler#0000
I feel like the number of allowed warehouses per player should be a configurable value by the governor.


[07-Nov-22 04:11 PM] churavis#0000
So the total warehouses doesn't change but the governor can set a limit on how many each player can take?


[07-Nov-22 04:11 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, like if there's 800 empty warehouses available, why limit it to 3 per player?

{Reactions}
üëç 

[07-Nov-22 04:13 PM] churavis#0000
I mean, realistically it makes sense but game play wise it would basically remove inventory management as any kind of significant challenge.


[07-Nov-22 04:15 PM] churavis#0000
If you make the game too easy the it becomes boring


[07-Nov-22 04:19 PM] exeler#0000
I mean, if you build a few STO it's not really struggle. 

Also we can rent nearly infinite warehouses at all the CXs


[07-Nov-22 04:26 PM] churavis#0000
But STO cost area, which is the most precious and bottlenecked resource in mid to late game


[07-Nov-22 04:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
The warehouse upgrade is for players who don't have bases but want my CLI üòâ


[07-Nov-22 04:48 PM] churavis#0000
What about the players that want your AUO and MGS?


[07-Nov-22 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
The AUO ones gotta build a base and make their own STO


[07-Nov-22 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
It does seem a bit funny to build a planet side STO and promptly fill up the mass limit but not the volume.


[07-Nov-22 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just put stronger shelves in!


[07-Nov-22 04:50 PM] churavis#0000

[08-Nov-22 02:20 AM] exeler#0000
Turns out I accidentally doubled up on BBH and BSE orders. I suspect I forgot to hit the key to turn BDE in the text box into "Basic Structural Elements" when submitting the LM orders so I wound up submitting a second BBH and BSE order instead of BDE and BTA orders.

So I now have the proper orders up for the BDE and BTA that I just discovered I'm missing üòÖ

do we want to switch to SUN? @yuen8241 calculated it's the cheapest now

That's probably a good idea, given that C is easier to obtain than EPO

[12-Nov-22 12:05 PM] domicius#0000
Are you going to make more Rfabs? Or should we look for alternative supply?


[12-Nov-22 12:05 PM] domicius#0000
I'm not even sure anyone else in-Corp makes one


[12-Nov-22 12:07 PM] churavis#0000
I make Rfabs but the bottleneck has been EPO and CX prices for EPO are way past break even for corp prices of Rfabs, especially RSE


[12-Nov-22 12:10 PM] domicius#0000
Raise the prices. The main issue with Rfabs isn't prices, but security of supply. I'll gladly pay more.


[12-Nov-22 12:14 PM] domicius#0000
Or I can build a couple of POLs. I suppose CL is the main sticking point?


[12-Nov-22 12:14 PM] churavis#0000

I can supply nearly all the rfabs you need on ANT, I rearranged my base building priorities. Some of the prices in your ads are a bit low for me right now and the price you put for RDE is way out there, looks like a typo? I put my prices in the spreadsheet.

@gladeowl the spreadsheet says you make 220 INS/d at 90/u (lower as you expand) ... I need 5k INS one time purchase + 316/wk on going ... can we make a deal?

Basically I want to purchase the entire base output for the next several weeks.


[19-Nov-22 04:16 AM] dehzhas#0000
LM Ads up:

* 40 total BDE
* 1432 MCG


[19-Nov-22 05:18 AM] gladeowl#0000
Alrighty, to reiterate.
5k INS - which my base will take *roughly* 22 days to produce at the current rate, and then 316 INS weekly after that.
If that sounds correct, then yeah.
Though I would need 2 extra days, as I'm currently fulfilling another order.


[19-Nov-22 05:18 AM] gladeowl#0000
However, if the demand for INS is high. I should see about expanding production sooner than I was expecting. Getting the input is gonna be something though.


[19-Nov-22 06:52 AM] jackinabox86#0000
There‚Äôs always a lot of demand. The amount of INS needed for one of those bases is insane

Oh. *time to plan the expansion*


[19-Nov-22 09:40 AM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, and really, I need 10k plus the 316 ongoing, because I am putting up 2 bases that need it.


[19-Nov-22 09:43 AM] dehzhas#0000
@gladeowl  Basically, whatever you can sell me over time as you expand would be awesome. If you need me to pre-purchase some amount of it to help boost expansion timing, I can do some of that.

Otherwise, I'll just be putting up LM Ads constantly in chunks of 500 units at a time and you can fill as you produce it.

Problem is I use all the GL I make and if I try to make more it means some other things don't get made (GEN, RG, NG) üò≠  so, in a way, GL is more valuable then CX price lol I've been playing with the idea of using another base permit on Deimos to build more GFs for a while. I don't plan on building any more bases because I can barely keep up with the logistics of the ones I have now so the inefficient permit use I'm okay with

I see the LTA is in short supply right now. Is that the same for the MCG? I can move it to another planet if need be.


[21-Nov-22 07:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
Because there is not enough glass.


[21-Nov-22 07:58 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Ping @rune_242  or one of our MCG producers.  Not everyone checks discord as frequently


[21-Nov-22 08:00 PM] yuen8241#0000
Generally, few people put a lot of MCG in Nike. It would be better if you bought it in Heph.


[21-Nov-22 08:00 PM] jackinabox86#0000
it'll likely get filled here, you just have to make sure the right person sees it


[21-Nov-22 08:00 PM] jackinabox86#0000
but I generally do a couple bulk orders a month on Heph and ship it over to Nike to make it easy on myself


[21-Nov-22 08:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
Nike's warehouse is so tight Ôºåand I don't even store it in Heph now, but put it directly in ANT.


[21-Nov-22 08:12 PM] gladeowl#0000
Oh I got it from the CX right as I posted that message. My amount was small so it's not expensive. Thanks though!


[21-Nov-22 08:14 PM] churavis#0000
I've got LTA, I just don't stockpile a ton since it isn't needed as much as other Lfabs


[21-Nov-22 08:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
But LTA consumes too much glass.


[21-Nov-22 08:16 PM] churavis#0000
I can make more GL it just slows down my GEN production


[21-Nov-22 08:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that we have enough PP2 now, but not enough raw materials. Glass is needed to make fabs, glass is needed to maintain the planet's infrastructure, and glass is needed to make Gen.


[21-Nov-22 08:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
But usually a person only has deimos as a metallurgical planet, and the demand for AL, FE, MFK and alloys is also great.


[21-Nov-22 08:22 PM] yuen8241#0000
If only Aceland had become a metallurgical planet, it was close to cx and produced ALO.


[21-Nov-22 08:34 PM] churavis#0000
Rune and I are going to settle WU-070a and turn it into a metallurgical planet for basic GF products. Now that GL is going to cost twice as much SIO, it's going to be even more useful to have GF on a SIO planet


[21-Nov-22 08:47 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think we‚Äôre good on everything but GL for b and l fabs. Even there, I rarely run out of LTA.


[21-Nov-22 08:48 PM] jackinabox86#0000
But I agree, there‚Äôs a big demand for GL and derivative products (like POPI inputs). There just hasn‚Äôt been enough demand on the CX to make the price high enough for the ridiculous time it takes to produce.


[21-Nov-22 09:23 PM] balbar#0000
I could put a few GF for GL on QJ-382c. Already have extractors working there for my SF-plant


[21-Nov-22 09:25 PM] churavis#0000
WU-070A is MCG only and 4 jumps from the CX


[21-Nov-22 09:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
The main problem is that there is not enough pioneer population to support the settler population.


[21-Nov-22 09:35 PM] churavis#0000
It will take time to build up the population


[21-Nov-22 09:37 PM] churavis#0000
The SST and INF have already been built


[21-Nov-22 09:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
But we must find jobs for the pioneer population. Otherwise, can we maintain a high population under the high unemployment rate?


[21-Nov-22 09:46 PM] churavis#0000
The only way that pioneer population directly affects settlers is through education but there's not going to be a ton of that anyways. You can still build a large settler population without many pioneers


[21-Nov-22 09:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
Well, I'm very glad to be able to solve this problem. All the population structures are not necessarily pyramid-shaped, but also spindle-shaped?


[21-Nov-22 09:49 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, that's ideal in fact because otherwise pioneers would eat up your higher tier upkeep


[21-Nov-22 09:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
I realize I have no idea what shape a spindle is. After looking on google image search, I am even less sure üòÑ

[21-Nov-22 10:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
The spindle is thick in the middle and thin up and down. The hourglass is the other way around, thin in the middle and thick up and down.


[21-Nov-22 10:05 PM] churavis#0000
That's a rhombus


[21-Nov-22 10:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think if unemployment is high at any tier, the population there will eventually fall. So if you have high settler employment, those numbers will grow via immigration. (Immigration only happens for pioneers and settlers).


[21-Nov-22 10:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Educating the higher tiers is a lot harder


[21-Nov-22 10:08 PM] exeler#0000
I'd have called this one a diamond


[21-Nov-22 10:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think from an upkeep perspective... the lesson is: Don't try to fight unemployment with high upkeep.

Speaking of RFabs, looks like I need to purchase 45 RBH, 44 RDE, 44 RSE, and 22 RTA.  Anyone want to sell into that demand or should I wander over to the CX?


[30-Nov-22 12:31 PM] churavis#0000
This is what I've got to sell:

[30-Nov-22 12:32 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Cool.  I'll send contracts for 24 RBH, 16 RDE, 16 RSE, and 8 RTA.  I'll check in in a few days to purchase more if there isn't other demand


[30-Nov-22 12:32 PM] churavis#0000
I'm always making more


[30-Nov-22 12:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Sounds great.  I flipped the prices for the RSE and RDE contracts, but they should total out correct


[30-Nov-22 12:36 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I fixed my EPO production so my production of rfabs should pick up now too


[30-Nov-22 12:36 PM] churavis#0000
My accountant will be pissed


[30-Nov-22 01:07 PM] churavis#0000
If Viggle has some to sell too then great but I should be able to make the rest of them in a few days


[30-Nov-22 01:18 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have 15 RBH and 10 RSE on Nike and 8 RHB, 4 RDE, 6 RSE on ANT

Have you sold these Rfabs? I want to buy them all.


[30-Nov-22 07:29 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah, they're still available, my prices are on the spreadsheet


[30-Nov-22 10:57 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Will we be able to cover Rfab demand within corp? @mrtcsmith @churavis it's funny because I was making Rfabs for months and never really saw any corp demand then as soon as I tear down my PP3 it goes nuts! lol

Just let me know if you guys aren't able to keep up with the Rfab demand and I can rebuild my PP3, I still have the consumables and some inputs available. But I will need a consistant EPO source - that was the reason I removed it


[30-Nov-22 10:59 PM] churavis#0000
I still have to buy EPO on the open market, that's the only way I can get enough for my 4 PP3, despite also making INS and HSE and having multiple POL bases. I've also stopped using DEC for upkeep or making much of it at all. EPO is definitely still the bottleneck.


[30-Nov-22 11:00 PM] churavis#0000
No one bought any Rfabs for weeks and I built up a pretty good stockpile of it until everyone decided to buy all of it in the course of just two days


[30-Nov-22 11:11 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have plans for another EPO base to supply another 2 PP3 for 5 total


[30-Nov-22 11:13 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have a HAL base setup recently which is slowly getting up to speed with enough population


[30-Nov-22 11:15 PM] yjhasaday#0000
you have 4 of them?!! Wow, I applaud your logistics üëè I struggled to keep even the one going. Then again I had zero EPO or PG production  anywhere so I had to buy a lot from market, every time I made a trip to Griff to buy no one had anything üò≠ . Still... 4 PP3's - well done!


[30-Nov-22 11:15 PM] yjhasaday#0000
lol glad to know I wasn't the only one that noticed this üòÖ


[30-Nov-22 11:16 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Right on! If you make any surplus and need to move some I will buy off you! Just let me know if you need a buyer


[30-Nov-22 11:27 PM] churavis#0000
If you think 4 PP3 is fun you should try 1 PP4, which needs a whole bunch more including the output of about 1 PP3

[01-Dec-22 12:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
I produce part of EPO myself, then I buy some from Corp and some from cx. Even then, I can't always produce Rfabs.

It takes about 26 POL to maintain 6 pp3


[01-Dec-22 12:25 AM] churavis#0000
How many CHP to make the CL for that much EPO and how much HAL?


[01-Dec-22 12:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
I recalculated that it takes 26 POL and 16 CHP to maintain 6 PP3. If there is a dedicated HAL base, it needs 9 EXT.


[01-Dec-22 12:32 AM] yuen8241#0000
That is to say, we need two dedicated chemical bases, and then rely on others to obtain HAL.


[01-Dec-22 04:34 AM] domicius#0000
I have 221 HAL to sell

Yep, I usually keep a large stock pile of H here on Nike but its really low right nowüòÖ I've pushed back my 2000 trip to QJ because I had some others that needed H so it is on its way back from demeter right now then it will go out to QJ, once it gets back I can sell you some H on Nike. Unfortunately I can't sell H on Nike or QJ at the moment üò¨ I think there are some other H bases out there though (if you need it urgently)?

Just the last two terms. Before then it was very smooth, like it is now. The extremely rapid rise in TECH/ENG demand is why I thought there was another corp making a run at trolling the planet for tax money (build a bunch of high end buildings then complain about unemployment to get elected, then max taxes and screw everyone out of a lot of money). In the end it seems that Swatacular is actually a pretty decent guy that just wanted his unemployment addressed lol ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[06-Dec-22 07:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe someone saw your activity decrease, and then deliberately came to Nike to build a bunch of high-class buildings to incite the overthrow of OOG. The cost of building a bunch of high-grade buildings is affordable for old players.

Sounds good! I'll look into how expensive it'll be to add 2 more HB1 so I can add 3 extra EXT at some point in the near future to get you at 280/day ‚úåÔ∏è

[08-Jan-23 07:58 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Also, judging from the PRUNner Coremod price factor, y'all are seriously underpricing your prefabs lol (it factors like... around 90k cost for the core mod)


[08-Jan-23 07:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can ship everything over all at once,  core module, base modules, and consumables. Save some trips. The core module doesn't actually do anything on your own so it's nice to have at least some other buildings go up at the start too


[08-Jan-23 08:00 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Wait, really? I thought I'd need to do it incrementally due to storage issues (running basic ships atm)


[08-Jan-23 08:01 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
You build the core module from your ship so as soon as you build it, you have the 1500 storage to move everything else from your ship. At least build a couple of CHP so you can start making CL for when you build the POL.


[08-Jan-23 08:03 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Makes sense


[08-Jan-23 08:06 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Too bad PRUNner doesn't mention how much the mass/volume of require prefabs come out to, like it does with workforce inputs, would make it way easier to calculate shipping


[08-Jan-23 08:07 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Wait, POL? What's that? Should I be building one?


[08-Jan-23 08:07 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I just rammed the base full of CHP's and left it at that


[08-Jan-23 08:09 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Ah no sorry, that's if you are doing EPO


[08-Jan-23 08:09 PM] yuen8241#0000
I hope you can provide CL, because what is lacking is CL, and the production of EPO and DDT is restricted by CL.


[08-Jan-23 08:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
POLs make the EPO from the CL you get from your CHPs. If you are selling CL directly to Yuen though, then that's fine


[08-Jan-23 08:09 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahh right, yeah, no, I'm building the base to supply CL, not use it myself


[08-Jan-23 08:10 PM] churavis#0000
I have been buying CL from the CX and LM so I would be happy to buy it in corp if you start making it

[08-Jan-23 08:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
POL and LAB can be placed on other planets, but a planet like Griff that produces HAL is most suitable for new players to produce CL, because the pressure of HAL's transportation capacity will be very low.


[08-Jan-23 08:12 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
With zero experts, I should make 32.33 CL/day. With 3, 36.36. With a full 5, 41.51. Also, a bunch of NA. Dunno what that's for but I assume someone will end up buying it.


[08-Jan-23 08:13 PM] churavis#0000
You'll probably end up dumping the NA on the CX as we already produce far more NA than we consume


[08-Jan-23 08:13 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
That' with 15 CHP, though I can probably squeeze in 1? 2 more?  Looks like 67 leftover land


[08-Jan-23 08:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I put a STO on every planet. You might get by without on with this base though.


[08-Jan-23 08:14 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll prolly go that route too. Not having to stress over space is a godsend.


[08-Jan-23 08:14 PM] churavis#0000
Whether or not you want an STO depends on how often you want to have to visit


[08-Jan-23 08:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
You definitely need to build STO, because HAL and NA take up a lot of space.


[08-Jan-23 08:16 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hopefully there's plenty of HAL miners, I'll be using 125 a day.


[08-Jan-23 08:17 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Do you think maybe I should scale down the number of CHPs and get some EXT to offset inputs?


[08-Jan-23 08:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can consider buying from Corp or LM. HAL is easier to obtain, but you need to have a certain capacity to ensure that you can get a certain HAL from CX to hedge the risk.


[08-Jan-23 08:21 PM] churavis#0000
It also depends on how much excess capacity the HAL producers have, which I believe is just @sginga and @mrtcsmith right now


[08-Jan-23 08:22 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah that's my main concern. I'm cool with buying HAL from corp/local, if viable. Not being subject to the wacky whims of the CX bullshittery is optimal lol


[08-Jan-23 08:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I can supply some HAL from xk-005d, you will need a bigger ship though. I'm just waiting on the last expert to get to about 300 HAL/day


[08-Jan-23 08:25 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I'm contemplating building a COGC for the bonus but it's probably not worth it. I built the LM and WAR just in case they're needed.


[08-Jan-23 08:26 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
It really becomes a completely different sort of game once you hit this point, huh. I remember ferrying my fuel production to Benten CX to sell at whatever the price happened to be at, marveling at the insane bulk some folks had put up for sale or bid, which is what inevitably determined my newbie self's income. Utterly at the market's whim.


[08-Jan-23 08:28 PM] churavis#0000
If you do decide to build a COGC then I can provide all the mats at a discount from the CX. Actually, for things like BWS, I am the sole provider on the CX anyways, lol


[08-Jan-23 08:30 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Once supplies of HAL are stretched again I will do it, it's an extra 70-80 per day which could be another EPO base


[08-Jan-23 08:31 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm. Considering how PRUNner says I'll eventually have to buy 25k worth of HAL a day, it might end up more profitable for me to build a HAL extraction op alongside yours, and help with the running costs.


[08-Jan-23 08:33 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Looks like there's some HAL on the CX at least. Wide margin.


[08-Jan-23 08:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, considering that GL also needs FLX now, your CHP can occasionally produce some FLX.

[08-Jan-23 08:33 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
More bids than supply though, which is interesting.


[08-Jan-23 08:33 PM] churavis#0000
From a pure efficiency perspective, specializing in one industry is far better as you can get 160% efficiency instead of just above 100% by stacking experts on the COGC, but it does make logistics more complicated so it depends on what you want to optimize for

{Reactions}
üíØ (2) 

[08-Jan-23 08:35 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Aye. I'd prefer to go max efficiency if I can manage it. Gives the in-corp and friendly local producers an income, and saves me the trouble, assuming there's steady supply. If supply is shaky though, then that's when it might be best to run suboptimally but consistently


[08-Jan-23 08:37 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Until I'm at the point where I have higher-capacity ships, I also need to be careful on the shipping front.  I can't just fly to a neighboring System/Planet/CX and buy a ton of whatever I'm missing yet üôÇ


[08-Jan-23 08:39 PM] churavis#0000
I usually have excess capacity in the ships I send ANT-Griff and others do as well so I'm sure you can post shipping contracts if you need to.


[08-Jan-23 08:39 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Lovely, that'll ease some of the pressure then.


[08-Jan-23 08:40 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll most likely go for max CHP's to start and if HAL ends up becoming a problem, I can work around the issue.


[08-Jan-23 08:41 PM] churavis#0000
If HAL gets expensive on the CX and corp supply is insufficient you can always build your own extraction base on YK-005d

[08-Jan-23 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
How many HALs are consumed in a day?  If there are three experts.


[08-Jan-23 08:43 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Starts off at 97 HAL with zero, then 3 experts with 15 CHP (slightly below max) would be roughly 110 HAL a day. Maxes out at approx 125 HAL a day, give or take, at 5 experts. That's with COGC bonus factored in.


[08-Jan-23 08:44 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
so roughly... 7-9 HAL/day per CHP.


[08-Jan-23 08:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you have a WCB, transportation is not a problem.


[08-Jan-23 08:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
HAL's not that heavy.


[08-Jan-23 08:44 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

A WCB is enough for you to maintain a CHP base in Griff and an SME base in deimos.

As a matter of fact, I have a WCB inventory now. As long as you solve the LFE problem, it's basically done.


[08-Jan-23 08:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that they have sold all LFE to CX, but the new one should be produced soon.


[08-Jan-23 08:49 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

[08-Jan-23 08:53 PM] erklein#0000
Other thing to keep in mind is that CHP has quite a few workers compared to its size, so you're going to need to make sure you have plenty of consumables if you haven't calculated that yet

[08-Jan-23 08:54 PM] churavis#0000
It's important to have at least a little bit of everything on the CX even if it's at a super high price so that the super desperate can still buy it. If I price it lower then it will get bought by the less than desperate and not be there for the super desperate

I wonder if anyone's tried to game that via shenanigans... buy/sell at stupid prices, trade it back privately.


[08-Jan-23 08:55 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
just to manipulate the listed prices.


[08-Jan-23 08:56 PM] yuen8241#0000
Great, that's what I thought when I sold DW and RAT. Pay for it or starve to death.


[08-Jan-23 08:56 PM] churavis#0000
It wouldn't be satisfying if I cheated, what's the point of that?


[08-Jan-23 08:57 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Definitely, but I've seen it enough in games with organic economies that I'm instantly distrustful of min-max listed prices by default lol


[08-Jan-23 08:57 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Not so much a 'do the thing' as a 'god damn it someone's bound to have done the thing'

I mean, you're not wrong though


[08-Jan-23 08:59 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its nice that rising prices inevitably turn into a 'screw that, I'll make my own' situation, creating new production chains üôÇ


[08-Jan-23 09:01 PM] churavis#0000
I've seen that happen a lot where the supply for a mat on the CX is totally dry for a long time until I offer it for a super high record breaking price, then a whole bunch of people pile to supply it and push the price down. I'm not sure why that is but it's funny.


[08-Jan-23 09:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
Sometimes, I buy all the products whose prices are obviously lower than those of other cx's, and then ship them back to ANT. So if we only look at the price of one CX, sometimes it's strange that the price has soared.

[08-Jan-23 09:02 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
...That reminds me, I wonder if there's still literally no MAI/NUT/BEA on the CX or if that's been rectified since back before I had my harmonia FRMs


[08-Jan-23 09:02 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I recall having a mission to buy one of those and there was absolutely -nothing- on the cx. pissed me off lol


[08-Jan-23 09:02 PM] yuen8241#0000
Because they need to determine whether there is really a supply-demand relationship.

[08-Jan-23 09:03 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I do that for non-bulk just for the hell of it. If there's a handful of units driving up/down a price I'm invested in, I'll just pay off the difference


[08-Jan-23 09:04 PM] churavis#0000
But why would they wait until I put up a high offer to do that, couldn't they have just put up their own at any time?


[08-Jan-23 09:04 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
though in my cases its a tiny margin of difference that ultimately means nothing


[08-Jan-23 09:05 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think it costs a lot to build a new production line or switch production. They need a clear trading signal to make a decision, and it will take some time to actually sell after the decision.


[08-Jan-23 09:05 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Consider how we operate with internal corp prices, and it might make more sense. We may produce and consume a MAJOR percentage of what rolls through the local CX, but since we don't actually go -through- it, the numbers aren't properly simulated and recorded. So any little nudge can have catastrophic consequences that aren't grounded in reality


[08-Jan-23 09:05 PM] exeler#0000
Before the high offer the old price was probably low and tools like PRUnner will report bad PP, but as soon as there's a big jump in price the PP looks a lot better and people might switch to it in the hopes they can sell it for that or a similar price.


[08-Jan-23 09:06 PM] churavis#0000
But an offer, without any actual sale, won't affect the average price and thus won't affect PRUNner


[08-Jan-23 09:06 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Switching production is definitely something to be well-planned. Especially when you're going from a fleshed-out supply chain toward a higher-profit but more complex one.


[08-Jan-23 09:07 PM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, once a deal is made, Prunner will think that this industry/product is very profitable, so many people will turn to it.


[08-Jan-23 09:07 PM] exeler#0000
I think you can set PRUNer to look at the bid/ask price instead of average. And PRUNer isn't the only tool out there people are using to plan bases or production


[08-Jan-23 09:07 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like, in my case, CHPs on Griff, PRUNner says I'd make way more from producing.... What was it... Ah, MED/SC. Like, from 30k/day to well over 100k.


[08-Jan-23 09:08 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
29k to 153k for MED, and 310k a day for SC.


[08-Jan-23 09:08 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Which is fucking nuts. BUT... way more complicated to supply I assume.


[08-Jan-23 09:08 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Seeing margins like that, someone's bound to get googly eyes and want in


[08-Jan-23 09:08 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
which also means abandoning their previous supply chain, etc


[08-Jan-23 09:09 PM] yuen8241#0000
Experienced people will comprehensively consider all kinds of information to make investment decisions, but even if several people are affected, considering the narrow market of this game, the price fluctuation will be great.


[08-Jan-23 09:09 PM] churavis#0000
It is more complicated but the real issue is that the velocity for MED just isn't there so you could only make a little bit before you oversaturated the market, that's why people haven't switched to that

{Reactions}
üíØ (2) 

[08-Jan-23 09:09 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Right. There's so much nuance to the market, and that's the great part about this game.


[08-Jan-23 09:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
You should also consider that there are 4 major CX


[08-Jan-23 09:12 PM] yuen8241#0000
If the advanced product is expensive in ANT, players who need it are able to buy it elsewhere. That's what I did.


[08-Jan-23 09:13 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Plus, if a bunch of people stop making, say, CL, or anything else, in order to flood the market with MED/SC/insert-random-thing-here, that inevitably screws every local HAL/etc supplier, which means their markets get flooded with unsold goods for a bit, which means prices/sales will likely drop, some suppliers who aren't established enough to CX flip/network might consider switching to a different product altogether, causing a whole cascade effect of prices rising and falling across various chains, altering the balance of economic power potentially in an entire system/sector, at least until some dude with a thicc fleet swoops in and makes a killing üòõ


[08-Jan-23 09:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
Even ANT can't consume the MED produced by my two chps.


[08-Jan-23 09:13 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
heh


[08-Jan-23 09:15 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
It really is pretty nuts how much a few bases producing random product ABC can end up affecting the local economy in weird ways


[08-Jan-23 09:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
The CX transaction volume of MED/SC products is very small, and the profit shown by PRUNNER is only theoretical profit.


[08-Jan-23 09:15 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like, I'm sitting here thinking what the end result of me buying HAL from a few people, selling CL in-corp, and you guys no longer buying CL on CX, which translates to lost CL profits to whoever you buy from, so on and so forth down the line


[08-Jan-23 09:16 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
If I could, I'd just sit around watching the CX tickers constantly go up and down every day lol


[08-Jan-23 09:18 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Figure its probably the same for anything beyond the initial production stages tbh. Niche goods, which sure, over time there's more demand as the galaxy matures, but not as fast/voluminous as, say, everyone and their mother needing metric fucktons of RAT/DW everywhere at every moment in time


[08-Jan-23 09:19 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like, if we weren't producing ship parts in-house at corp prices, what would that do to the ship parts market? How much of the current pricing is volatile or frozen because ship upgrades tend to be produced in-house by major corps?


[08-Jan-23 09:23 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Anyway, I'll stop nerding out now lol. We've spammed the everloving hell out of the Nike channel today üôÇ Good talk though, learned a ton of new stuff üôÇ


[08-Jan-23 09:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, most of the ships are produced and sold in Corp, and if they are bought from cx, they are either expensive or out of stock.

You can rent a warehouse without having a base.  Each planet has its own price per week to rent and limits on how many you can rent.

I can make some more PP1. I make plenty of PE


[19-Jan-23 08:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
The market share of BDE is relatively small. I found that PE consumption in our shipbuilding industry is too large. If we have enough PP1, continued expansion will lead to extra production of redundant BDE.

Generally speaking, I only sell fabs to those who sell products to Corp. At the same time, the raw materials needed for fabs, such as AL, which I purchase from members of Corp., are only sold to those who sell fabs to Corp at reasonable prices.


[23-Jan-23 06:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
If new members invest in the products needed by Corp, they can get loans or sponsorship from me, and the specific scheme can be negotiated.


[23-Jan-23 06:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
This is the price of the products I plan to purchase and sell. I will sell the goods at the original purchase price according to the above principles.

[23-Jan-23 06:13 AM] yuen8241#0000
I balance price with reference to market price, return on investment and transportation cost. The current internal price is too low in the face of increasingly serious inflation, and there is no control over the flow of fabs.

@yuen8241  @jackinabox86 I'm looking for 44 LSE and 34 LBH. Do you have those in stock?


[03-Feb-23 05:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
I do. You can buy it from me at my price.


[03-Feb-23 05:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
I buy and sell at the same price, and usually my stock is only used for personal use and sponsorship. I can't remember the last time I went to cx to sell fabs.


[03-Feb-23 08:54 AM] domicius#0000
Yeah. Actually having enough Corp fabs is a strategic requirement really


[03-Feb-23 08:55 AM] domicius#0000
Hunting for fabs is difficult and expensive


[03-Feb-23 08:55 AM] domicius#0000
And it's generally too capital intensive to put in  ore-orders and lock up your assets in CX orders

@archielvahr @churavis


[26-Feb-23 08:00 AM] churavis#0000
The unemployment numbers are for the previous week. Engineers were trending downwards due to lack of upkeep so the last week we only had 103 unemployed engineers, that few could easily be used up in building a software farm or something.


[26-Feb-23 08:03 AM] churavis#0000
7.6% sounds like plenty but out of 1,384 it's only 103


[26-Feb-23 08:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
Nike engineers can't normally need so much. There must be an SE farm here.


[26-Feb-23 08:52 AM] churavis#0000
If there is a new SE farm then they'll be paying way more in tax than anyone else so they'd probably actually be paying enough to fund new upkeep

I produce MG on Elon to allow full specialize into chemicals and have enough capacity to provide another full base. The spot price is 50/u, the long term volume price is 45/u if you make it a regular thing.


[16-Mar-23 11:16 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
+2 POL to produce PG pushes me over the 5k/day threshold... eventually (at Experts 5). Base needs 110u/day of MG. I'll def take regular delivery, thank you.

As far as I understand, other than sharing the Governor/shared income, there aren't any other benefits/negatives/taxes to being in a corp? I'm not for or against the idea, I just don't know what it entails.


[16-Mar-23 11:19 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
However, I have gotten a little cosy with members here already, so consummating the arrangement further is agreeable.


[16-Mar-23 11:39 AM] exeler#0000
In game I think joining the corp officially is just the corp dividend. While it's nice I don't think it's really significant except for newer players. The governor job is pretty much a thankless money sink, especially when the taxes get spread across the whole corp. 

I think the corp is mostly for the social aspect. Having regular trading partners who set steady prices and have pretty steady demand is more valuable to me than the dividend.

[30-Mar-23 10:50 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Fair enough, I thought you had a specific need for it


[30-Mar-23 10:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
I recently rebuilt my base, so the consumption is a bit large. I hope to reserve some. Things like fabs are consumed quickly, but production is slow.

or does someone have a supplier?


[28-Apr-23 02:06 PM] churavis#0000
There's not really a good NE source in Antares anywhere, we're probably better off buying it from the CX, or importing it from another one than trying to set up our own source in another region


[28-Apr-23 02:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, that's the problem though is the CX is empty


[28-Apr-23 02:12 PM] churavis#0000
Ant only gets NE from traders from other systems


[28-Apr-23 02:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
right but we have a good amount of gas planets here, it's a bit precarious relying on the AEF or NE trade


[28-Apr-23 02:15 PM] churavis#0000
I've got a good amount of AEF stockpiled if you need

Related to the BDE, I'm happy to sell mine in corp for the lower MM price. 

I've been stockpiling BDE on the CX and wiping out the buy orders occasionally and then setting the remaining BDE I have up at whatever the highest bid was.

I have 3 PP3 on Nike, mostly producing INS and a few Rfabs to support my own expansion


[07-Aug-23 03:09 PM] churavis#0000
It's not the PP3 or PP4 that are difficult, it's the supply chains to support them that are hard and complicated.

[08-Aug-23 08:33 AM] draconisdomini#0000
EPO I mean


[08-Aug-23 08:34 AM] churavis#0000
Heph is a manufacturing world, We have Griffonstone and Elon if you need another chemistry base


[08-Aug-23 08:36 AM] draconisdomini#0000
PE is made in BMP, so it's manufacturing.  Kind of weird because you'd think plastics would be chemistry


[08-Aug-23 08:37 AM] churavis#0000
The BMP was just where they placed all the miscellaneous things that they couldn't find another place for


[08-Aug-23 08:42 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah.  I have a bunch of BMP scattered around making different things and it's got to the point where it makes sense to consolidate them onto Hephaestus


[08-Aug-23 08:43 AM] churavis#0000
Do you have a PG base on Elon already? I sell bulk MG there for cheap so others can specialize.


[08-Aug-23 08:44 AM] draconisdomini#0000
No, IId is my only chemistry base at the moment


[08-Aug-23 08:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
oof, expensive first chemistry base


[08-Aug-23 08:46 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah, maybe should have gone to Griffonstone or Elon, but I also extract H on IIg


[08-Aug-23 08:51 AM] draconisdomini#0000
IId is the main reason I'm 12th on HSE production, lol


[08-Aug-23 08:52 AM] churavis#0000
A single base doesn't need that much HSE


[08-Aug-23 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
hah all 3 of us make the same amount of HSE


[08-Aug-23 08:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
I sell mine mostly though, even with 2 HSE bases


[08-Aug-23 08:54 AM] draconisdomini#0000
No, but I built the PP3 on Nike pretty much solely for supplying the HSE and INS I needed, and just kept producing afterwards


[08-Aug-23 08:55 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Had it not been for IId I wouldn't have gone into HSE production


[08-Aug-23 08:55 AM] churavis#0000
I've been providing discount HSE for a while, you could have just bought from me


[08-Aug-23 08:57 AM] draconisdomini#0000
Oh, well nevermind


[08-Aug-23 08:58 AM] draconisdomini#0000
I've switched over to Rfabs now anyway


[08-Aug-23 09:33 AM] domicius#0000

[11-Aug-23 11:24 PM] higgsy#0000
Hmm, maybe I shouldn't make any HSE


[11-Aug-23 11:26 PM] higgsy#0000
I'm considering making a PG base on Elon and switching Griff to EPO only.


[11-Aug-23 11:28 PM] churavis#0000
That's what many have done, I provide bulk MG to several corp members at a bulk discount. This allows you to specialize in chemistry only and increase output

[14-Aug-23 08:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
definitely recommended, since it's where most construction mats are. You'll have an easier time upgrading from Nike

[14-Aug-23 09:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
I just pick things I like the idea of making and work towards making them. Right now I'm on the biggest excursion yet with trying to setup an engine production line. You have a good variety of planets so you should be able to setup most small-medium sized production lines without issue. Maybe an FP base is what you're missing

Why did you build the shipyard on Nike all by yourself?


[18-Aug-23 11:59 AM] dehzhas#0000
Because I need a puddle jumper there and figured no one else really would be interested.


[18-Aug-23 11:59 AM] dehzhas#0000
Unless you happen to be on the other planet I settled in the system, it's not really useful to you.


[18-Aug-23 12:00 PM] churavis#0000
An ftl capable ship would have been cheaper than a shipyard and a puddlejumper


[18-Aug-23 12:00 PM] dehzhas#0000
True, but logistically, this is cheaper on my brain


[18-Aug-23 12:01 PM] churavis#0000
You could have had the FTL capable ship do exactly what the puddlejumper would have and still come out ahead


[18-Aug-23 12:03 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, I know. It's just one of those things that has bugged me for ages that I can't build one there so I finally broke down and just paid for it, lol.

Well I'm sure others will use it eventually


[18-Aug-23 12:05 PM] dehzhas#0000

Nike is the only good planet in Ant III, but Ant II has Vulcan, Deimos, and Ant2d (my epoxy planet). And Ant I already has a station. So Ant II does make sense

Should I build a Nike base for making prefab if I only import resources from CX?


[22-Aug-23 09:02 PM] exeler#0000
I haven't run the numbers, but I think doing that would run into supply issues of the metals pretty quickly. 

A full Nike base can chew through a TON of metal, and buying that much from the CX might cause the prices to raise a bit. 

I guess if the prices go up too much, more people would be incentivized to sell it and bring the prices back down ü§î 

Either way, there's probably much better uses of a permit. I think construction is one of the starting profiles though, so it's probably doable.


[22-Aug-23 09:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I do find my Nike base to be my most profitable, but I have a lot of support planets making AL (and NR / EPO for the rfabs and afabs)


[22-Aug-23 09:28 PM] higgsy#0000
Deimos produces all the AL I need for the PP1 and PP2 prefabs at Nike.


[22-Aug-23 09:31 PM] higgsy#0000
You can then import resources depending on what you're making. I buy PE to make BDE on PP1. For PP2, you can make BSE and BBH with just the Deimos AL and LST you mine on Nike.


[22-Aug-23 09:33 PM] higgsy#0000
Plus the planets are really close to one another. Almost as if someone set them up that way. And we get a sweet corp bonus for Nike being our HQ.


[22-Aug-23 10:18 PM] martin1194#0000
how many SME base do u have?


[23-Aug-23 09:47 AM] higgsy#0000
25


[23-Aug-23 09:48 AM] higgsy#0000
But I'll add a few more now that I have a ALO base on Nascent


[23-Aug-23 09:49 AM] higgsy#0000
Could also get my O from Etherwind if I make a H2O base at ISA


[23-Aug-23 11:54 AM] exeler#0000
Etherwind makes so much O. If your not making STL, you only need a couple buildings there. I have a 750 area base that's like 85% SME, and I use O in a bunch of other bases. I made like 6 buildings for O on Etherwind and I have way, way too much. 

If you're willing to pick up at Etherwind, I'll sell O at like 20/u

{Reactions}
üò≤ 

[23-Aug-23 12:02 PM] churavis#0000
I've got more O than I know what to do with as well and will be holding regular auctions on ANT for any that don't want to trek to Etherwind


[23-Aug-23 12:07 PM] exeler#0000
Same, most of the time I don't have the shipping capacity to take it back to ANT so I just use the LM to dump it. 

Recently I've had some luck with shipping ads though, plus I'll have doubled the size of my fleet in the next few days so shipping should be much less of a problem.


[23-Aug-23 12:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
I make steel out in the boonies and have an O deficit at 120/d, so I'd be happy to buy any available at ANT


[23-Aug-23 12:20 PM] churavis#0000
Send me a contract for 1200, I'll do more auctions in the future

does the workforce capacity in the `BS ZV-194a` screen match the workforce capacity in prunplanner?


[27-Feb-24 11:28 AM] melon164#0000
When they rebalanced the sizes of the hybrid accommodation buildings, they didn't change existing structures.  If you demolished and rebuilt your HBB/HBM, they'd come back smaller


[27-Feb-24 11:28 AM] melon164#0000
Or rather, five of them would come back smaller; you must have built one of them later


[27-Feb-24 11:33 AM] neth_havoc#0000
yes


[27-Feb-24 11:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah melon's got it, I remember that issue. If I had to guess it's the 5 HBBs that are old..?

If any of the LST producers ever have surplus LST, just throw some shipping ads to ANT up on the LM and they'll get filled quick. I often have extra space on my way back and I'm sure I'm not the only one. The market for LST is quite good right now and there's no shame in selling your surplus at full price.

[28-Jul-24 11:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think in the corp people just don't always check all their elections. But yeah, it seems like he runs them pretty cheap because he's got an army of people making stuff for him below cost. :shrugs


[28-Jul-24 11:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Malahat is going really well with this model. I expect to break even  in a couple more weeks- that's with charging the government CX prices. But if you aren't pulling solid cash outof Nike... as long as it's got pop I'll support whatever you decide.

In the past he has DMed every person on the planet, via in-game chat. I'm sure there's a ton of people on Nike that aren't in any discords for the game


[30-Jul-24 02:28 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd not seen a public message anywhere, so seems likely that is what has happened here.


[30-Jul-24 02:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
On a related note, there' a minor firestorm in the private phobos governance chat


[30-Jul-24 02:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
Similar topic?


[30-Jul-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
MemoryAlpha is a MP also, and really really wants the SCI and ENG electronics tax rate on Phobos halved. Income is about double the expendatures and there's 7m in the bank. Which in my opinion is not really a lot, or a cause for concern.


[30-Jul-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Rise wants to save up a "rainy day fund" and MemoryAlpha is absolutely not having it.


[30-Jul-24 02:33 PM] sidepipe#0000

[30-Jul-24 02:33 PM] akyantor#0000

[30-Jul-24 02:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's kinda weird because Rise is still funding the planet pretty well using his discounted rates from his AA sponsored bases. And the POPI has been fine.


[30-Jul-24 02:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
MemoryAlpha is all riled up because of the "legacy OOG tax rates", lmao

[30-Jul-24 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000

[30-Jul-24 02:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't fully understand the profit sharing arrangement, and how much of the shipping burden is his. But I think all products go to him and then are split back out as a profit share. So whatever it is, it's hundreds and hundreds of contracts


[30-Jul-24 02:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh you ship it to a CX then contract it to a secretary. You buy your own inputs, deduct the cost of them, then...  once a week get paid maybe with a portion of the products  you made...????

[30-Jul-24 07:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, but a few things tend to happen.
* People realize it individually, not as a group.
* The playerbase has a constant churn
* He is really good at catching new players and getting them into his base sharing system, which promotes a "sport team"-like mentallity that people don't always break out of easily


[30-Jul-24 07:19 PM] draconisdomini#0000

And his ability to somehow create conflict in *this* game is impressive and frustrating and pretty against everything KAWA is built on in my mind.

I just can‚Äôt understand someone being so frustrated by what is such a tiny percentage of his operation


[30-Jul-24 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been watching the phobos finances like a hawk - at least as close as I watch malahat's. He's good a pretty reasonable plan there. His reasons for complaining about other people who run planets are bonkers, because he runs them with really thin margins, and then complains if someone else either A) runs the planet at higher cost with a bigger population buffer - wasting money or B) Runs the planet cheaper but uses festivals to maintain the population or C) runs the planet the exact same way he does ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Like there's always something to criticize even if they overlap

That‚Äôs always been my approach to taxes too. I think people in Rise‚Äôs discord just take him at face value when he complains about a planet, which isn‚Äôt unreasonable because he genuinely knows a lot about the game. It‚Äôs just that he likes to stir up people in bad faith like this


[30-Jul-24 07:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, if he keeps taking the bigger planets I'm just waiting for issues

Rise keeps going on this festival rant, which is a really weird hill to die on, but I'm just not gonna argue the finer points. I did make a section of the spreadsheet to calculate festival costs and benefits though, so no one really has any excuses ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I think we have a good amount of good will on Malahat


[30-Jul-24 07:32 PM] draconisdomini#0000
The only thing I would say against Festivals (and why I prefer not to use them) is that they have less lead time than the 30 day reserve the POPI has, so it is easier to forget to trigger the next one

[30-Jul-24 07:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's true.. unfortunately with the new system I feel like I need to pay attention to malahat like every 3 days to keep things smooth. Esp everything I put in needs to be tracked in the sheet.. so it's a hassle.


[30-Jul-24 07:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not sure if Rise is directing votes towards Paris also- presumably not on Nike. But with 33 members in OOG and at least 23 bases on Nike, I sort of figured we'd have more votes for OOG candidates. I think maybe that's indicating more of our player count is idle than usual.


[30-Jul-24 07:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just gotta keep on top of that player count


[30-Jul-24 07:35 PM] draconisdomini#0000
On the other hand, if we direct a few more votes to Paris we can have 2/3 seats on the Parliament and over-rule Rise if we want


[30-Jul-24 07:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeaaaaah although realistically the meta has been to let the governor run the planet and the MPs are essentially backup. We could break that pattern if we wanted. I'm not sure how I feel about that


[30-Jul-24 07:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
I flipped my vote to Paris. 8 to 8, one more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I was not thinking of over-ruling him immediately, just using it keep him on his toes


[30-Jul-24 07:37 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I flipped mine as well, so now it's 9


[30-Jul-24 07:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I don't think he'll try anything fishy while he could be outvoted.

Cool. Yeah I don't think there's anything I have in mind. I do buy bulk upkeep items from whoever- Tuffy sent 7m of stuff via that system. But probably the effort of coordinating or planning is more than just doing it, unless you are just delivering piles of DW and OFF or whatever

[01-Mar-25 04:27 AM] martin1194#0000
Finance going down on Nike. Expense is higher than income. Will see in future. At least have some reserve in Nike.


[01-Mar-25 04:27 AM] martin1194#0000
Will figure out


[01-Mar-25 04:43 AM] bookliko#0000
On the cost side, I see a lot of unemployment, which means a lot of POPI upkeep items might be going to waste


[01-Mar-25 04:44 AM] bookliko#0000
Maybe the prior government provided cheaper upkeep materials (below CX price) or CX prices went up?


[01-Mar-25 04:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, if you are cash strapped I would look at the unemployment. The 25% and 30% extra PIO and SET will add up to eating a lot of POPI upkeep items.


[01-Mar-25 04:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Festivals are cheap and cost effective, but since they affect each tier, they are causing that +10k extra PIOs in one week. Running Education jobs is a way to grow the engineers without so much Pios


[01-Mar-25 04:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
the growth will probably just settle down without festivals


[01-Mar-25 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I see you are filling SUN on the SST. It's not really wasted, since the safety is 76%- it's not like its 100% or even 90%, so I think that's okaaayyy. but it'll be cheaper in the long run to get the SST to level 10 and then only run DW and OFF


[01-Mar-25 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
The education upkeep is probably lost because culture was capping it at 7% this week (4% last week). The Art Cafe doesn't really add much culture compared to the art gallery


[01-Mar-25 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I slipped in some DEC since it's close to a popi rollover


[01-Mar-25 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
but that'll help a little with the Culture and Education, which is weighted towards the higher tiers


[01-Mar-25 04:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyway, if Nike runs out of money and needs funds to upgrade the SST to make it cheaper, Phobos can offer a grant

I don't think Gov's should have to pay out of pocket for planet stuff. Mistakes happen, if it costs $ to correct the mistake, that should still come from the planetary budget imo. If increased taxes are needed for that to happen, increase taxes.

As long as they're not being silly with it, I'll always support Gov's against people who complain about taxes.

Governing is kinda like flying a plane, and trying to get it as low to the ground as you can. The lower the taxes/plane the better.... but if it crashes into the ground (pop drop) everyone yells at you and won't let you fly any more. The not crashing part is way way more important than the get low part.


[15-Apr-25 05:21 AM] martin1194#0000
Yup. That's why I don't promise tax reduce forever. :hh:


[15-Apr-25 10:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
@martin1194 a festival has to be run this POPI


[15-Apr-25 10:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
the happiness will take 3 weeks or so to recover


[15-Apr-25 10:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
in the meantime half of the ENG will go away


[15-Apr-25 10:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
make sure to run a festival 3


[15-Apr-25 11:40 AM] martin1194#0000
Running it after noticed the issue.


[15-Apr-25 11:40 AM] martin1194#0000
I think currently upkeep can let open job return to zero in the next report.


[15-Apr-25 11:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
I don't think so, 400 ENG won't show up in 1 report I think unless at 100% happiness


[15-Apr-25 11:43 AM] martin1194#0000
The last report has 172 ENG jobs looking for ppl.


[15-Apr-25 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
no it's now 172 missing + 602


[15-Apr-25 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
so you're now -800 ENG


[15-Apr-25 11:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
you need 800 ENG


[15-Apr-25 11:45 AM] martin1194#0000
602 means 10% pool?


[15-Apr-25 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
look at the Change for ENG


[15-Apr-25 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's -602


[15-Apr-25 11:45 AM] hernanduer#0000
the "Open jobs" are bases missing jobs


[15-Apr-25 11:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
so 172 were missing before the report ran


[15-Apr-25 11:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
the report runs and another 602 ENG leave


[15-Apr-25 11:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
you are now missing 172 + 602


[15-Apr-25 11:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
when next report runs it'll say 774 ENG "Open jobs"


[15-Apr-25 11:50 AM] martin1194#0000
Open job number caculate before the change?


[15-Apr-25 11:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
right


[15-Apr-25 11:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
my base alone is missing 64 ENG


[15-Apr-25 11:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
so we're definitely missing a good amount


[15-Apr-25 12:04 PM] martin1194#0000
!! So this damage can't solve in 1 week.


[15-Apr-25 12:38 PM] martin1194#0000
As someone said, this issue has happened 1 week earlier, not the day I realise.


[15-Apr-25 12:40 PM] martin1194#0000
But used the tool based on wrong report. Was suppose TECH and ENG can still positive but PIO and SET will negative.


[15-Apr-25 12:41 PM] martin1194#0000
This issue needs to solve in 3weeks can't in 1 weeküíÄ


[15-Apr-25 12:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
it'll be oik


[15-Apr-25 01:11 PM] martin1194#0000
If I want to speed up ENG resume speed. The PIO also will increase a lot. üíÄ


[15-Apr-25 02:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How many ENG? ~700? How many does an Eng immigration program bring?


[15-Apr-25 02:27 PM] akyantor#0000
It's quite a small amount, I thought it's only 50,


[15-Apr-25 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, Festival 3 and education 3 is both better. I did run the numbers and Festival 3 has a slight edge


[15-Apr-25 02:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am hoping we can pump up the education value too


[15-Apr-25 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was DMing martinc before I noticed this chat here üòÖ


[15-Apr-25 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
With these fulfillment numbers, we can get this satisfaction:

[15-Apr-25 02:50 PM] archielvahr#0000

[16-Apr-25 02:42 AM] evov#0000
Sequence of events for the reports as I understand them ->

Report comes out -> Says there were 172 open engineer jobs.
Then the pop shuffle happened and we had 681 Engineers migrate out, 79 Engineers Educate in. Leaving a change of -602 Engineers. 
Last week's pop was 4638. Minus 602 gives us this weeks engineer pop of. . . 4036.

So, if BEFORE the pop shuffle happens, there were 172 Open Engineer jobs. And during the pop shuffle another 602 engineers leave the planet, unless people have shut down bases during the week, your actual Open jobs is more like 774 Engineers.

When happiness is <50% people leave. Engineers happiness last week was 48% and 62 of them left. Engineer happiness this week was 28% and 681 of them left.

Happiness comes from a number of places ( Need fulfilment, Festivities programs, Open Jobs etc )
Over the last 5 weeks, need fulfillment has been steadily dropping. This failure is sometimes compensated by running a festivities.... but even festivities can't carry single digit need fulfilments. They especially can't compensate for bad fulfilment when they don't get run.

[16-Apr-25 02:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
what happened??


[16-Apr-25 02:46 AM] evov#0000
Lack of need fulfilments + not running any program.


[16-Apr-25 02:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh damn


[16-Apr-25 02:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
unfortunate


[16-Apr-25 02:48 AM] evov#0000
Example - going back a few weeks to where the planet was a lot more healthy -

I think an education would have made more sense than a festivities in this case, but as longa s there's no pop drops.... I'm fine with whatever the gov is doing at this point in time

I don't know what you're using, but that is showing 294 ENG


[16-Apr-25 08:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
there are a lot more than 294 ENG


[16-Apr-25 08:50 AM] hernanduer#0000
I wouldn't trust that at all, instead get Archiel's governor sheet that it's based off of


[16-Apr-25 10:03 AM] martin1194#0000
This is PP. Now, I mostly use in-game data after the issue. 
If I still use tool for help, I will check the data is it match to game.


[16-Apr-25 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
The tool is supposed to be identical to the sheet. But yeah that is definitely a bug on TUB for UNI.


[16-Apr-25 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
If the POPR report is only a week or two off the population will be close enough for the need fulfillment number to be good enough. If it‚Äôs way off like Martinc had then it will give you drastically wrong percentages.


[16-Apr-25 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
I also have an issue open with Scorpio to change how the data is presented to make the tool a little easier to use.


[16-Apr-25 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
Right now in the tool, you have to click the true happiness tab. Then it shows you the need fulfillment.


[16-Apr-25 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
It depends a little bit on your goal, but I usually try to target 70%


[16-Apr-25 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
Then after filling needs check on the estimated happiness


[16-Apr-25 01:19 PM] martin1194#0000
but the report number is 209 üíÄ  
In excel, we can find out which part have written mistake but this bug should be need find out by the developer.


[16-Apr-25 01:25 PM] martin1194#0000
ummmm.    About LU, is that I wait ur LU? Or I make contract with Hal?


[16-Apr-25 01:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will leave a ship waiting for the LU and take it to Nike when Hal is done making it


[16-Apr-25 01:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
LU takes 1d 12hr, I believe Hal already started, and I think he has more than 5 UPFs. Then it will probably take half a day to get from Lom Palanka to Nike. So... I _think_ we will make it before the next report. Does that sound right to you, @.urpalhal ?


[16-Apr-25 01:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I also upgraded the SST and ART, and I will bill Phobos for that, since Phobos has extra cash. And the UNI has everything but the LU


[16-Apr-25 01:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
I also added OFF to the SST and the INF. I think we might get capped on Safety since I added it late in the cycle.

I‚Äôll just take them to Nike myself?


[16-Apr-25 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmmm sure you can drop them into the UNI so we don‚Äôt have to coordinate the contract. That works!


[16-Apr-25 04:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Assuming you have a ship around

Borrow some of mine for the week if needed. Hal or Archiel, send me 2 conts. One where I'll sell you the LU you need for 1 AIC today. One where you sell me back the LU for 1 aic in a week.
I have 6 at ANT at the moment if needed.

[20-Apr-25 09:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Culture was capped by the 56% safety


[20-Apr-25 09:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
and Education was capped by the Comfort.


[20-Apr-25 09:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
And that 56% safety was sort of with all 3 filled in the SST. I filled the OFF a while ago, but not for the whole POPI


[20-Apr-25 09:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
So we should probably aim for 100% SST filled.


[20-Apr-25 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
