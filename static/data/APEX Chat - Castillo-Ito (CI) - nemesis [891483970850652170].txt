**mjewkes**:	Fucked up shipping :| will be tomorrow mid day


[27-Sep-21 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Dont forget to lower the taxes :-) (Why not alreay?). So I can redo my production orders with lower fees


[27-Sep-21 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	hi guys , how do you buy a currency ?


[27-Sep-21 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	found it :p


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I will be flying BEN -> MOR, departing in about 16h, 90t free, 4 CIS/t


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Yay!


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	😁😁😁


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	oh, we get 10 days free before we need to put in upkeep? nice


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	does it just default to pioneers at the start, then?


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	@mjewkes you have done an incredible job making the ADM and the COGC a reality. Youve got my vote for as long as you're interested in being Governor. For a small planet to pull this together so quickly is quite the accomplishment


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDementedSpidey**:	Congrats Nemesis on the CoGC!


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Yes - default start is Pioneers - didn't pick that


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Thanks Daemeus :)


[27-Sep-21 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Organizing small teams to make things happen quickly is my day job :P


[27-Sep-21 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'm going to leave the tax rate high until the weekend so that we have a buffer. I'll put together a budget for maintenance and then plan on dropping it to the lowest we can affordo n the weekend


[28-Sep-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShutterEye**:	congrats to us for the CoGC


[28-Sep-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDementedSpidey**:	Oh hey Shutter, didnt know we were neighbors here too


[28-Sep-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDementedSpidey**:	@mjewkes, are you planning to have the tax cover current upkeep + some additional for safety station and other needed upgrades?


[28-Sep-21 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	anyone doing a ben --> nem ?


[28-Sep-21 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	If i have this small thing I can expand right now


[28-Sep-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Otherqise I wait the Tour Nem - Ben that I mentioned earlier


[28-Sep-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	i leave ben in about 4-5 hour so ill be back tomorrow at nem


[28-Sep-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	and plan to take your thing if still waiting in nem


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Small add is up


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	saw that popping :p


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You may accept all Nem Ben contractsnof your liking. In case I extend the contract


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I wont have an own ship back before 4 or 5 days


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	ill take everything but not sure about the 1 day one


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I may repost it then :-)  Just write here again


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	sure :)


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In 10h I have 2 x 1 day shippments


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	i mean as long at it fit in my ship :p


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	the 1 day is just a bit fuel costly for me atm


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will make it 2 days...


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	but we can negociate something if you have constant shipping to do :p


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I just had the feeling that a trip lasts less then 24h for me on average - without wasting fuel


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	think its 1 day and just a few hours more


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I am close to offer my first 500t/m3 shipping. But maybe I can avoid it. Was thinking about 2.500 to 3.000 CIS for that but not sure what is a good price


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	not sure either, depend on fuel usage tbh


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	be back in 1 h see you :)


[28-Sep-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Yeah - taxes should cover COGC upkeep, and any POPI we need to keep pioneers fed. Probably shouldn't be too much, but I need to run the math


[28-Sep-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Anyone need anything brought back from MOR? Can bring it to NEM or drop off at BEN. Lots of space. 4 CIS/t to BEN, 7 CIS/t to NEM.


[28-Sep-21 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	not departing for another 21h


[29-Sep-21 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Vakkys** joined.*


[29-Sep-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Welcome to Nemesis @Vakkys!


[29-Sep-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vakkys**:	Ty :) I'm new so I might have a few questions every now and then :D


[29-Sep-21 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Well, welcome to PrUn too then! COMP help or COMP global in a new buffer window will be helpful at first... :-)


[29-Sep-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	What industry starter did you choose Vakkys?


[29-Sep-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Good time to be on Nemesis. Food, Water, and Carbon are all pretty viable right now


[29-Sep-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Oh, was someone else planning on grabbing those contracts? I just had seen them there and figured I'd pick em up since I needed to make a trip out to Benten.


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Anyone need anything shipped NEM -> BEN? I have 140t free


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	hmm


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will add a small one


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	okey dokey


[29-Sep-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You "snipped" some contracts but as pricing was "generous" it will be OK for you as well


[29-Sep-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	np


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	as long as my base is emptied :-)


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	There will be more soon


[29-Sep-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	:D It's heading out now. Estimated delivery time is 1D 7Hr


[29-Sep-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	sleeping time (after midnight) then


[29-Sep-21 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vakkys**:	I went with Carbon, Mjewkes, tho I'm just starting out :) glad to hear its viable


[29-Sep-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Carbon prices are the most volatile of the three.


[29-Sep-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	At this moment they're pretty good (C.NC1 C.CI1)


[29-Sep-21 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	350-400 is pretty good.


[29-Sep-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I would be careful going all in on Carbon though.


[29-Sep-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Carbon prices have dropped to the ~200 range previously


[29-Sep-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vakkys**:	I see. How would you suggest diversifying, if I may ask for some advice :)


[29-Sep-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Not something you need to worry about right away.


[29-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	But eventually, you could look at building more FRM and selling the products here, or building an EXT and converting H2O to DW at a FP. Or building a few FRMs and making RAT at a FP


[29-Sep-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	You could also look at RCO and BMP to make OVE


[29-Sep-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Lots of options!


[29-Sep-21 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vakkys**:	Anyone needs anything shipped BEN -> NEM? Almost 500 t/m3 available. price negotiable :)


[29-Sep-21 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vakkys**:	Also ty very much mjewkes!


[29-Sep-21 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm always in the market for INC materials, got a large bank of SME and PP2 offworld that are always hungry.


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	dont we have enough pio's anymore?


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	2.5% unemployment at last POPR, so pretty close


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	May have used up the rest this week


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	ok will be 0 next report... i am missing 99


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	god dang it zizzleswomp XD


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	hopefully getting the safety station supplied will start getting us some more


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	yeah hopefully. but isnt there also always a generic population growth?


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	so long as happiness is > 70%, it grows. Just a few percent more and it grows by a LOT. Latest info here: https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/

[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	but we're all growing pretty quickly, too. So how much happiness we need to keep up with our base growth is hard to estimate


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	ahh ok thank you :) yeah espeacially with all the newer ppl, which will grow a lot soon


[30-Sep-21 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	ahh ok there i have my workers XD


[30-Sep-21 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	So there are 53 of us on Nemesis... and so far only 10 have voted on the next COGC program (needs to be done every week).


[30-Sep-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Plop "COGCPEX JS-299a" into a new buffer window and make your choice! It's easy-peasy. 🙂


[30-Sep-21 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Reasonable options (IMO) are, in no particular order: Pioneers (10% bonus), Agriculture (25%), or Resources (25%).


[30-Sep-21 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	ohh i didn't see that we had the GogC up ^^


[30-Sep-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	btw. how can you increase your influence on the voting?


[30-Sep-21 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Increase the amount of people your base has


[30-Sep-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	My influence is 330 which matches the amount of pioneers I have. I don't know if the influence is weighted though depending on your type of population ie pioneers = 1 settlers = 1.5 etc


[30-Sep-21 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	I think last universe a ran a base with almost only BMP in it. Was great for voting power. Great Pioneer density :D


[30-Sep-21 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	I was almost up to 2k in voting power. Good times


[30-Sep-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	@AceXephon: The voting is indeed weighted by population tier.


[30-Sep-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	The weights are in the handbook


[30-Sep-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Pioneer 	1 Settler 	1.25 Technician 	1.5 Engineer 	1.75 Scientist 	2


[30-Sep-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	BEN -> Nemesis departing in 12h, 200t free, 3 CIS/t


[01-Oct-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'm flat out of BEA. Posted a buy at 130/unit.


[01-Oct-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Do we not have enough local FRMs?


[01-Oct-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	There's too many better ROI buildings. I'm looking to tear down FRMs, if anything


[01-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I'm usually farming NUTS. I have BEA going right now, but I planned on using it to make some RAT because I'm getting low.


[01-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	got my third farm but same than ace gotta need some dw/rat


[01-Oct-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	and ill need to build hab1 next so wont get more farm soon :p


[01-Oct-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	atleast i could help you with the Bea nd GRN ^^


[01-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Zizzles - mostly i agree- but what price would be a good steady ROI ant current RAT/DW prices?


[01-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Well, everything's skewed right now with H2O and DW selling so high. An equivalent ROI to match a RIG would make BEA cost, like 170+. To be fair, I've focused my experts more on resource extraction than agri, so that favors the RIGs looking better than the farms in my numbers


[01-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Now that I have a full base, area usage is becoming more important than it was. I'm not sure how to weight that against ROI yet. FRMs are pretty area-intensive though, so I doubt it helps their case.


[01-Oct-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	you can expand your base with new permits


[01-Oct-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	^


[01-Oct-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	and you can get more by upgrading hq


[01-Oct-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I mean, the nice thing that isn't captured by RoI is that if you sell FRM products locally, you basically never need shipping to/from nemesis


[01-Oct-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Maybe very occasionally for OVE/PWO


[01-Oct-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'd love to set up a planet somewhere that didn't need constant supply/export hauling


[01-Oct-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	It looks like at a RAT price of 55, I can afford to pay 125. Looks like the RoI on the FRM is still better than the RoI on the FP, but at least I can specialzie.


[02-Oct-21 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ShutterEye**:	wasn't there a plan to lower to tax at weekend???


[02-Oct-21 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ShutterEye**:	there seems to have no change as i can see


[02-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Hey ShutterEye - the Oct 3 was always the planned date to lower taxes. I posted on Sept 27 (above):


[02-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	>I'm going to leave the tax rate high until the weekend so that we have a buffer. I'll put together a budget for maintenance and then plan on dropping it to the lowest we can affordo n the weekend


[02-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'd like a single week of buffer.


[02-Oct-21 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Plan for tomorrow is to update our accounts and project how much we need on a weekly basis.


[02-Oct-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	why not doing upkeep + 20% or something to plan for future infrastructure or something ?


[02-Oct-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Our future infrastructure needs are pretty clear cut, there isn't a lot of ENG/TEC demand here on Nemesis. I will include those in the budget.


[02-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Mostly we need to maintain and upgrade our safety station.


[02-Oct-21 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I haven't heard that there is a lot of interest in other infra.


[02-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	yeah was manly thinking about safety station


[02-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Yeah - I'll include that in the budget. 💯 I will not let us run out of pioneer workers.


[02-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	maybe health but yeah ^^


[02-Oct-21 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	haha :p


[02-Oct-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	gotta get those sl.. i mean worker nice and cozy


[02-Oct-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	:P


[02-Oct-21 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Shipping out to BEN in about 10 hours with a mostly empty freighter, anyone need anything shipped?


[02-Oct-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I have an ad to post in a sec


[02-Oct-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Ad posted.


[02-Oct-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	So I'm working with some people on Emenitor about setting up a deal for C and O2.


[02-Oct-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	So depending on what the demand is, I should be buying a significant quantity of C


[03-Oct-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	i have 6 incs  running on katoa


[03-Oct-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	C me if you need some C, haha


[03-Oct-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	oh wait carbon is up to 400 NCC on Moria


[03-Oct-21 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	never mind, don't C me. I'm gonna get that dosh for myself.


[03-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	FYI - I'm increasing my RAT production. Will be looking for 65 BEA 65 NUT and 65 either GRN or MAI, every day.


[03-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Which means I'll be posting and filing lots of ads on the LM


[03-Oct-21 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	In general, I'll fill ads at ~RAT price * 1.85


[03-Oct-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I can often go up to RAT*2 - depends on if the order book is filled and likely to go down further


[03-Oct-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	So at RAT.CI1


[03-Oct-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	(A price of 60), I'll pretty much autobuy anything at ~115. I have to think a bit about a price of ~120, and above that starts to look unprofitable.


[03-Oct-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Waff**:	Alright, thank you for the specific info!


[03-Oct-21 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Ok, cut the taxes by 66% - this should basically cover expenses.


[03-Oct-21 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Don't quite have the spreadsheet forecast ready yet, but I do have a shipment of DW/RAT/PE/MCG for the next CoGC refresh


[03-Oct-21 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Should be smooth sailing for a few weeks

[04-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	@mjewkes can you take LMA BEN/626 too? it's just a tiny delivery


[04-Oct-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	can anyone help me out with 10FF? posted LM ad, double market price


[04-Oct-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Yep - got it @opie


[04-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	👍


[04-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Prunner says that providing PG for DW yields a better ROI than not using... so that's what i'm doing now.


[04-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	(and there's PG in that package)


[04-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	You're shipping PG to MOR?


[04-Oct-21 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	on second thought i probably should have just bought it there


[04-Oct-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	The agriculture education program beat out the pioneer program? I thought it was for sure going to be the pioneer program again.


[04-Oct-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Does anyone have some spare COF and PWO they'd be willing to sell? Might as well go full boost


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	is cof worth it ?


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	i mean how much % do it add ?


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	with a few experts and CoGC on top of it, almost certainly


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	your base efficiency goes from 0.87 (with PWO) to 1.00 (with PWO + COF)


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	multiply by 1.1 for a few experts and then 1.25 for CoGC, if applicable, and the multipliers compound nicely


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	If you get even more experts, even better


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	yeah i took pwo already by i find cof a bit expensive


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	but*


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	If the CoGC switches to something that doesn't benefit you, it might not be worth it anymore


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	The usual advice is to work the numbers out with and without COF and if your expected profit goes up by more than the cost of the COF, then it's worth it


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	hmm ok think ill wait a little more before using it


[04-Oct-21 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	prefer stability atm :p


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Ok OK Im lazy. Switched my experts to agriculture. Did someone calculated it ? Is ist the 25% Bonus multiplied with experts ? Is it amplifying the bonus (worth it?)


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Yes Experts are multiplicative with all the other bonuses like CoGC.


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	But you should also see the result from different expert when hitting 'NEW ORDER' in the PROD window


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So - just used my calculation paper. Switching  my experts increases my productivity per farm by + 16,67 % (or * 12 %). But I loose approx 12,5 % otherwise. As I dont have enough farms my total loss of productivity would be (expresed in %) 17,89. If I would repair and my line condition would increse by 9 % this would be even more.


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In other words: I switch back my experts - at least until I have more farms then other specializations.


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	BUT: The 25 % boost with my old expert setup on farming still boost the production by +27,84 % per farm (24,8 % relatively). What is - yeah - quite impressive.


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@loupdu25 - if my calc is working somwhow, for GRN if the MM price is 82 COF should cost less then 346,72 and with a price of 115 (mjewkes buy price) it would be 468,11. Of course for other products the calculation is different and it depends on my expert setting and "ressource in" costs.


[05-Oct-21 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	not sure about what that mean xd but thank :D


[05-Oct-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	After looking to COF.NC1 prices: They are too high


[05-Oct-21 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	When I do calcs using Rain's base planner, the breakeven for COF is around ~600


[05-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShutterEye**:	when is the next pop report??


[05-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShutterEye**:	i hope our pioneers will increase by a lot on the next report...


[05-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ShutterEye**:	i need to fill up 52 of them


[05-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I dont use that sheet. But it should be something like "savings due to time reduction" + extra units produced per day * (sell price unit - cost of unit) ? - cost of coffee (for 1 day)


[05-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I know its discuessed from time to time. But in that example (grain) I produce 1,83 more grain per day. Cost is reduced by 2 and 1 unit makes a "win" of 94. So in my understandinmg COF would give me 195,74 advantage/savings per day while it cost me 0,5 units

[06-Oct-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm in the market for some GRN, HCP and MAI if anyone is interested in selling. Let me know how much you're willing to sell for.


[06-Oct-21 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDementedSpidey**:	People are already in their 2nd or 3rd bases, they need more tech and not more basic fabs


[09-Oct-21 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDementedSpidey**:	demand is probably slowing down while current production remains high? But it'll probably go up again in the future since bfabs are always going to move until we start getting crowded


[09-Oct-21 04:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDementedSpidey**:	I'm loving the CoGS, but it also means that I now need to import water to sustain my farms + HYF and FP's. thats just weird


[09-Oct-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Anyone need anything shipped out to BEN?


[09-Oct-21 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	We had a new player spike about a month ago that shot all the prices out, these prices are more normalized


[09-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	It sounds like we might be seeing another new player spike coming soon. The last devlog talked about them having some YouTubers Lined up that will be covering them


[09-Oct-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Ah


[09-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Its funny, you only need 1 full base of PG to power most of the universe.


[09-Oct-21 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	A single POL produces sooo much PG


[09-Oct-21 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	idk, I'm running 3 pol just for my own consumption. I think there's quite a big market out there


[09-Oct-21 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Oh wow, really? What are you making out of PG?


[09-Oct-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'm running 5 PPF off of 1 POL.


[09-Oct-21 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-21 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Oct-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Just employed another hundred. It ain't much but it's honest work


[12-Oct-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Well I guess I should rephrase that I'll be employing 100, I was only able to get 35 of them today


[12-Oct-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And I have a required workforce of pioneers of 820 and a current workforce of 870 ??? So I have more workforce, as required


[12-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	They must really like your base :D


[12-Oct-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Oct-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aufricer**:	Will ask the intelligent in the help channel soon


[12-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	did you tear any buildings down this week, Aufricer? You hold onto the unused workers until the next POPR in case you want to re-employ them in a new building


[12-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	you hold onto them for a while, maybe not next POPR, that's just a guess


[12-Oct-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I did but thought it was more then 1 week ago + today i finally bought another building


[12-Oct-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So you are saying even with buildings teared down they still eat my ressources ?


[12-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	no, it's just they're not released back to the general pool immediately


[12-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	you only pay for employed workers


[12-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	similar to when you first start a base, you get 200 pioneers even though you might not be employing them all


[12-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	If I was on my phone I would send a "puhhh" icon

[14-Oct-21 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-21 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Mostly confused, but I'm not bankrupt yet


[14-Oct-21 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	What did you start out as?


[14-Oct-21 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	‎Victualler


[14-Oct-21 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	What's your current workforce consumption levels?


[14-Oct-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	4 DW and RAT/ day, 0.5 OVE/day. I don't have PWO (0.2/d) or COF (0.5/d)


[14-Oct-21 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	It'll be a little while before you'll start using PWO and COF. Have you sent out a ship to get some basic consumables already? If not I could probably sell you 10 days worth of RAT and OVE for cheap to keep you running for a couple weeks. I'm assuming you're running DW through your FP?


[14-Oct-21 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I'm doing some DW, but I am currently running low-ish on H20. I did send out a ship to Benten last night, but I went super conservative on fuel, so it won't get there for 7 hours


[14-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@hunqyn - if you have iddle ships. There is always demand for transport


[14-Oct-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Can you accept orders from the Local market ?


[14-Oct-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I've heard that, but not figured out how to do it.


[14-Oct-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Yeah, until you get more RIGs you'll have to pause DW production every once and awhile so you have enough H2O for your FRMs. If you want to post an buy ad for 40 DW at 1600CIS (40CIS/unit) and a buy ad for 5 OVE at 200CIS (40CIS/unit), I'll go ahead and fill them. Then you can keep your ship out there for when you buy up some construction parts for more buildings. I would probably just focus on one crop at the moment and sell it on the LM to earn some income and reduce transportation costs.


[14-Oct-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Open market = open a new buffer and type in LM JS-299a


[14-Oct-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	that is LM for here


[14-Oct-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	you know you can clue it to your console at your liking ?


[14-Oct-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And there is a lot of local markets. You can post adds if you have a base or a warehouse


[14-Oct-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	and accept all adds from all markets


[14-Oct-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Thanks. So, am I correct in understanding there are currently no shipping jobs available on our market?


[14-Oct-21 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	that's correct, but you can post in the chat here every so often to see if anyone needs anything shipped.


[14-Oct-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Sounds good


[14-Oct-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	If you want to put up an ad for 40 RAT at 1600 as well I fill that too. I meant to have you put that up rather than DW since you're producing DW, but at least you'll be set on both fronts now


[14-Oct-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	That's up too. It gives me an opportunity to keep my H2O going to my FRM for now, and I appreciate that.


[14-Oct-21 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Sooner or later I will post somethings. Also there might be demand to bring stuff from the CX stations.


[14-Oct-21 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Best practice (here, other places might be different) to give an info like "I may fly from A to B in about Z h if someone needs a shipment" etc.


[14-Oct-21 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	No problemo! The basics are something I think they should include a little bit more of when you start out because you only get like 4-5 days worth. Since there's so much to take in when you first start out, it's easy to miss the fact that you need to send out a ship to gather more consumables pretty much as soon as you start in order to keep running your base, especially if you don't have Pro.


[14-Oct-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I did grab Pro, but I also watched... a lot... of videos about it. So the first thing I did after building my initial base and production lines was send a ship out as slow as possible to the exchange so I could have it come back quickly without worrying about fuel once I knew what I needed to buy


[14-Oct-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	It looks like my initial goals should be grabbing a second RIG then FRM asap


[14-Oct-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	And that will max out my current 200 Pioneers?


[14-Oct-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	That would get you going pretty well


[14-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Those are good next steps. You could also consider FP or INC to do something with the FRM products


[14-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	In other news, unemployment is back in a safe range, so I'm going to defer upgrading the safety station


[14-Oct-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	shweet!


[14-Oct-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Ads up for MCG and PE if anyone wants to fill them today. Otherwise I'll fill them on saturday


[14-Oct-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Putting up ads for OFF and SUN as well


[14-Oct-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	The last guy who took one of those ads defaulted, so I won't pay until receipt on the OFF or SUN


[14-Oct-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	The prices are quite generous though


[14-Oct-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I have an FP, but DW takes more H2O than I can get with my one rig, and I don't have enough FRM to supply it to make RAT yet.


[14-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	If you've gone pro, hunwyn, you could also arrange to buy or sell FRM or H2O with others here.


[14-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Its definitely a more complicated and fragile route, but the game rewards specialization.


[14-Oct-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Another option is to consider using the slower but more efficient DW recipe that uses PG until you get more H2O production to do the fast one


[14-Oct-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	^ yeah that's way more efficient.


[14-Oct-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'll sell you some PG at cost if you need it to get started

**hunwyn**:	That sounds good. It looks like I could use like 4/d at maximum (which still would over-use my current H20) so what's "at cost" for those?


[14-Oct-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'll fill you an order of up to 50 at 12 per unit


[14-Oct-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Post a buy order.


[14-Oct-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	(PG.CI1 is the current market rate)

[14-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	haha, misread


[14-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Posted an order for 25


[14-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	there's no current demand


[14-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	someone cleared it out with a big shipment


[14-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I just built 2 POLs on Umbra... lol


[14-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I have 3 total now.


[14-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	oh, the bids will be back real soon, I'm sure


[14-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Yeah. I consume a lot of it. I'm not worried.


[14-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Many thanks


[14-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	👍


[14-Oct-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	So, I when I bring back my ship from Benten, I will have enough to build a new Rig, as well as hopefully fill that MCG order. If anyone needs anything else from Benten, I should be departing in about 4 hours.


[14-Oct-21 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	hunwyn - fyi the MCG order will only be up for 1 day. If you want to fill it, you'll have to take it before it expires or someone else grabs it.


[14-Oct-21 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Once you take it, you'll have 24h to provide the MCG


[14-Oct-21 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'll pay you the cash right away if you take it though :)


[14-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I already have the materials in Benten, I just need to bring them back with the ship once it's there to fill up.


[14-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I may have accidentally order-of-magnitude errored myself when I was buying those for my new RIG


[14-Oct-21 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Bought 400 instead of 40


[14-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Thanks


[14-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	glad to have you with us here on Nemesis, hunwyn. I like your company name, too


[14-Oct-21 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Many thanks. I imagine there are a lot of food producers here? Seemed to be the best starting planet for it if you were willing to be a bit further from the exchanges


[14-Oct-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	yup, though DW looks way more profitable to me than RAT. I also just do a fair amount of straight resource extraction


[14-Oct-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	If you don't have much filling your ships already, a couple of SCR extractors can be a good baseline income, guaranteed by the market maker price (* so long as the devs don't nerf the MM)


[14-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	And SCR sells for the same price in Moria, where a lot of stuff is cheaper, so I've found it to have been a great boost at the start


[14-Oct-21 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Good to know


[14-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	A full ship is worth 20k and it doesn't take long for 2 extractors to fill a whole ship


[14-Oct-21 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Later, you'll be making more valuable stuff and it might not be worth loading your ships with SCR, but for now it helps cover semi-regular trips to the CX


[14-Oct-21 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	You have Pro, though, so you have a lot more options to buy/sell locally and have others ship smaller loads for you


[14-Oct-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Leaving Benten in about 30 minutes last call


[14-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	not this time thx.

[16-Oct-21 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	11 FRM, 2 FP, and 4 RIG

[16-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Anybody here do business at CXs besides BEN?


[16-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I need to buy some EPO, but there isn't any at BEN.


[16-Oct-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It's for the OFF to keep our Safety Station supplied, if that makes it more attractive.


[16-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	Just FYI I'm actively making the EPO to make those OFF for the safety station.


[16-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Ah, saw the ad, didn't know it was already taken care of. Thanks for the heads up


[16-Oct-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	I mean, I haven't claimed it because I'm like 4 days out, but that's my plan


[16-Oct-21 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	If you've already got it under control that's great. I might just buy some excess off of you and supply it to my 2nd base.


[16-Oct-21 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will fly to MOR tomorrow - returning then. Just in case you need something small (like EPO) shipped in.


[16-Oct-21 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Well, it seems like EPO is taken care of... but let me check something else.


[16-Oct-21 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I was thinking about NL, but it's the same on MOR as it is on BEN.


[16-Oct-21 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I may try that market out when I do a 3rd base.


[17-Oct-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	If anyone needs water just post on the LM


[17-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	I know several people here, myself included, produce excess water.


[17-Oct-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Shipping out from BEN in about 8 hours with a mostly empty cargo bay (440 t), anyone want something shipped back?


[18-Oct-21 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Wooo got my second FP online. Now I should be able to actually make enough product to be worth selling.


[18-Oct-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	nice!


[18-Oct-21 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	congrats!, the first step in any corporate empire


[19-Oct-21 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Ads up for MCG/PE for CoGC. I'll generally pay slightly over market for this to ensure delivery.


[19-Oct-21 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Also - damn someone needs to get making MCG and PE


[19-Oct-21 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	prices are crazy :)


[19-Oct-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I put up a buy for PG locally. Apparently I forgot to account for the fact I'd be burning through that twice as fast... Not my proudest moment


[19-Oct-21 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Filled


[19-Oct-21 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	thanks!


[20-Oct-21 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Small delivery to Gibson at a decent rate on the LM if anyone is going in that direction.


[20-Oct-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	So it's taken me a while but I've finally got all my PP2's running at a stable rate... if anyone needs a certain kind of PP2 prefab, I can get producing it. The only thing I can't make is LDE


[20-Oct-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	why you have pp2 at nemesis and not at gibson?


[20-Oct-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I have 7 of them on Emenator


[20-Oct-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I just relay supplies to there through Ben


[20-Oct-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	so it links up nicely with my base here


[20-Oct-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	ahh ok


[20-Oct-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Flying back from BEN to NEM, anyone need anything shipped? I've got about 400t of cargo space


[21-Oct-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Got some cheap DW up for grabs on the LM. A new user wave is coming soon, better get it while it's still cheap.


[21-Oct-21 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	If too many of the new users go Vit though, couldn't prices go down?


[21-Oct-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Anyway, I hope prices go up...


[21-Oct-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	It's possible, but based on the price charts, during the last marketing run, prices for DW in Benten region went from the upper 30s to the upper 70s in just a month after the marketing campaign started.


[21-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	In just a week after the marketing campaign the prices surged by about 30CIS


[21-Oct-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	and even though the average line shows the peak being in the upper 70s, there were points where DW was going for almost 120CIS per unit


[21-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	That'd be pretty great. I'm making profit now, and am not in a great place for speculation (affording basic needs and expanding is more important) but I'd benefit if that happened :D


[21-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	unfortunately those costs bleed into other commodities


[21-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	so get in on those cheap bfabs while you can also


[21-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	True. For now though, i'm just going to keep selling what I can, when I can, and buying what I need when I can


[21-Oct-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I estimate my next expansion (the first time I need to build a new habitat first) will cost me nearly 44k, so it may be a while


[21-Oct-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	It won't take long to get to where 44k won't seem too far away


[21-Oct-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Just have to keep growing one step at a time


[21-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I figure. This definitely seems like one of those games where the attention you can give it while still being productive is fairly exponential in nature. I'm still at the bottom of that curve. Little more I can do than make sure I don't run out of consumables and CIS to run my jobs while I wait for an inventory to build up


[21-Oct-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I've had someone ask if we're planning on setting up a warehouse so that non-residents can place LM orders.


[21-Oct-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	This isn't something I've been planning, but if there is substantial interest, we can set one up.


[21-Oct-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	If anyone would like a brief increase of taxes to fund the construction of a Warehouse, please speak up.


[21-Oct-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Where will you buy it ?


[21-Oct-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Maybe someone can/will produce the materials for you and it would us save taxes


[21-Oct-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	How is the financial situation for NEM ? Did you get that "OFF" that you wanted to buy earlier ?


[21-Oct-21 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I might be smart to get one setup before the upcoming wave. We could potentially get a lot of noncitizen income selling consumables


[21-Oct-21 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	It might*


[21-Oct-21 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Lets see if it will be a "wave".


[21-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will fly BEN -> Nem by tomorrow. I should have lots of cargo space.


[21-Oct-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I may even take a short step on gibson (if its worth it)


[21-Oct-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	spent half my money getting another FP, Rig and Hab... wow bfabs are expensive


[21-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	How much do you need?


[21-Oct-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Braw** joined.*


[22-Oct-21 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Since the market dropped after I posted my ad, I lowered my price to 35cis/unit, but there


[22-Oct-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	's an extra 100 units in the ad. Feel free to message me if you would like to purchase in smaller amounts.


[22-Oct-21 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	And it's gone. Should have some more in about 4.5 days, but I can't guarantee the wave won't hit in that time.


[22-Oct-21 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Oct-21 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	yeah sorry, i am currently desperade for DW :) i need about 100ish per day over my 4 Bases...


[22-Oct-21 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	In about 3 hours, I'll have 100 units for sale. I could sell here rather than shipping out


[22-Oct-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Put up 100 DW on the LM


[22-Oct-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@zizzleswomb - just taking not that you participate in the auction for H. You think it is possible, that you bring a part for us (maybe next auction?)


[22-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Hey @hunwyn, I'm not sure if you check your PMs or not but I just sent you one.


[22-Oct-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I just learned why the COM side was flashing -- I had 2 DMs actually


[22-Oct-21 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I had a DM like a day after I started that I didn't know about until like a week and a half later


[22-Oct-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	About to head back from BEN -- will be leaving in about an hour if anyone needs things brought back.


[22-Oct-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I do have some H coming back from madnewmy's auction, but not too much. I usually flip it in Antares and buy more profitable stuff to bring back to Benten.


[22-Oct-21 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	The bids in Benten are up to 90/u, so I don't see selling for less than that w/ delivery to Nemesis included.


[22-Oct-21 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@zizzle, I see. So next time I need to pick up my own auction again.


[22-Oct-21 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Well, I can only bring 500t/m3 back, and at least a chunk of that is going to be my own stuff. I could potentially ship your full auction win from KI-401d to ANT, and then bring half of it back to BEN or something like that.


[22-Oct-21 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	It was just an idea. I may need a few (less then the 500) of H in a week or so. So I was not sure, if I should buy and bring a whole auction. I will see how and when but it seems I will take and shgip a full load sooner or later.


[22-Oct-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	That's only 1 vote for increasing taxes to fund a WAR - so I'm going to table the idea for now.


[22-Oct-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	It's a pretty cheap project, should only need a tax raise for 1 week, but its not worth doing if its not going to get broad use.


[22-Oct-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Its also cheap enough that it could be funded by private parties.


[22-Oct-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	1 vote ? How and where ?


[22-Oct-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Methinks the newbies has no idea how to vote. Including myself


[22-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I think it might've just been a vote through feedback in the chat. I was in favor of it, but I don't think there was anyone else who voiced their favor for it.


[22-Oct-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	^


[22-Oct-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	So, what is a WAR?


[22-Oct-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It's when a lot of people fight for some reason. Less sarcastically it's a warehouse


[22-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I mean, I wouldn't be opposed, especially since we're a starting planet. Having people be able to come in and buy from or sell to our LM could be useful


[22-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	That and we've had a few people already struggle with storage space and a warehouse isn't *that* expensive to build.


[22-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	only takes basic components IIRC


[22-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	yeppers just bfabs and mcg


[22-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	and some tru


[22-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I've actually got a ship with over 40 BBH/BSE on the way from Emenator I can contribute


[22-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I don't have a space problem, but increasing the viability of selling locally rather than flying out to BEN is a big deal to me


[22-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	(yet)


[22-Oct-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm completely willing to shop locally for the over 3k RAT/DW i consume per month


[22-Oct-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	You and I...


[22-Oct-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	We should talk


[22-Oct-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	:D


[22-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Also, points at the DW on the LM


[22-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	the WAR would be 24 BBH, 24 BDE, 12 BSE, 300 MCG, and 20 TRU


[22-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm actually trying to think of my next move. My Emenator base maxed out alarmlingly quickly so I'm looking to move into another market


[22-Oct-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	As long as i'm comped for it I can buy up the remaining materials for it from BEN and ship it all


[22-Oct-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I'm not in a position to make a bulk contribution, but I'm okay with getting taxed a bit more for it to be made.


[22-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I can also handle increased taxes for a week or so


[22-Oct-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	it would also be cheaper to do it now while bfab costs are low. Who knows when those prices will get jacked up again


[22-Oct-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	There really isn't a good reason Nemesis shouldn't be one of the best interstellar grocery stores considering it's the best starting planet for Victtuallers (or however its spelled)


[22-Oct-21 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Actually, Promitor is better... PLI VH-331a. But Nemesis is certainly the best in the CIM region.


[22-Oct-21 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	we don't have a food-planet like hortus does, though


[22-Oct-21 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I put up an ad for SCR @ 78/u. Less than MM, but saves you the hassle and cost of shipping.

**mjewkes**:	Hey all! @Couch has generously donated the required materials for a WAR. Since all of our POPI/CoGC needs are met atm, I've given our current reserve fund (50k). Not nearly enough to cover the costs at market rate, but a token of the planet's thanks.


[24-Oct-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-21 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	On one hand, that's great for new players. On the other hand, it's horrible for new Victuellers


[25-Oct-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I don't mind too much since I don't depend on it for a profit and it helps the lower the prices for other things.


[25-Oct-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	helps to lower*


[25-Oct-21 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I wouldn't mind making a bit more off of my excess DW though


[25-Oct-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Yeah, it was making me some nice income. Guess I'll have to map out a bit of a pivot.


[25-Oct-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	When it's one of the only two things you're making, it's a bit of a concern. :/

**Zizzleswomp**:	true


[25-Oct-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	We're very much nearing a point where you can just sell the water


[25-Oct-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	for near the same price


[25-Oct-21 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	The other option for H2O is HYF


[25-Oct-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Personally, I did just down-adjust my DW production and up-adjust my RAT production. Will be placing more buy orders for FRM products :)


[25-Oct-21 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I'll get an HYF... eventually


[25-Oct-21 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Alright, so I'm about to do the monthly "Making sure I don't have to worry about consumables for the next month" run early. Gonna need 2500 Rat/DW and 275 OVE and COF. I can get it at the CX but I'd rather start here first.


[25-Oct-21 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	If you're interested in selling some I can break it up into pieces, and I'm perfectly fine with overbuying a little bit.


[25-Oct-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I have 400 DW available @ 31/u if that interests you


[25-Oct-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	150 COF up


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	H2O may crash next, as people who were producing it en masse for DW pivot away from doing so


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I do think it's just a matter of weathering the storm there. Hell, it might even be worth buying a large stock of water and waiting for the price to bounce back


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	err, DW, not H2O


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	If I had some funds that weren't already tied up, I would certainly be buying up cheap DW and holding it until it hits a higher price point


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Alternatively you could buy it at Hortus and sell it at Antares


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It's very nearly hit the bottom end of the MM at Hortus, 25/unit now


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Still in the upper 50s/lower 60s at ANT


[26-Oct-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Problem is that ANT doesn't have much volume


[26-Oct-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	ANT is down to 20 a unit now


[26-Oct-21 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	So what we've learned is that DW is monstrously unstable right now.


[26-Oct-21 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	You sure you don't mean Hortus? ANT looks like it's still at 60 to me


[26-Oct-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	oh i was looking at H20 not DW lol


[27-Oct-21 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Hi, I would need some Carbon, run out of it. Add is on the LM. If you can just sell 1 or 2, that would be fine for me as well

**Aufricer**:	Allmost empty ship on BEN going to NEM. In maybe 1h or so

[27-Oct-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	If anyone has some extra BTA laying around, I have an ad up. I know it's not the most appealing amount, but that's what I would be buying it for on the BEN CX so I figured I would check here first.


[27-Oct-21 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	OK - Will be in ebison in about 3 or 4h. If anyone has something to bring from there as well.


[27-Oct-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Couch**:	about*


[27-Oct-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	115 is a lot... Even me I will need a few more BSE as my Farms will need also an update. All of them have a noverall condition of only 90 % now...


[27-Oct-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Is there a way to have another CoGC program ? Or is everyone just int farming recently ?


[27-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	My main income is currently from Ag sales which is why I usually go that route, but I would also be alright with the Pioneer program


[27-Oct-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	but I do believe there's quite a lot of farming bases here


[27-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I feel like Pioneer is probably the one that's going to help the most people here, but at the same it's not as strong a bonus as a more focused one is.


[27-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I've got a full base and only one facility isn't extraction related, for example


[27-Oct-21 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	(Not that I mind it going to agri players, I get everything I need with the base as it is)


[27-Oct-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	I have 11 farms, so I want agriculture forever.


[27-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Etherwind is a better planet for water extraction anyway.


[27-Oct-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	which leaves only sulfur extraction but that's probably a minority of people here.


[27-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm not *actively* extracting sulfur, but that's because one EXT of SCR can supply the entire universe right now


[27-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	when I start running low I build an extractor to get a few before demolishing it again.


[28-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	yeah pio is better for all, also otherwise many people will need to restructure anything which can be a pain with full bases


[28-Oct-21 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	At what place could I see how much security the safety station provided ? It was somewhere but I just cant find it at the moment


[28-Oct-21 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	What @Couch said. PIO would help everyone. However, either Ag or Resource Extraction are far better bonuses, which ends up helping the region more, as a whole.


[28-Oct-21 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	i mean on nem is quite a split between extraction agri and Food industries... whatever you we would go for, it would suck for the other ppl


[28-Oct-21 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	and 10% to everything would help all since i dont think, many will go into heavy tech stuff here


[28-Oct-21 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	and t obe honest Ryst i dont understand why the 25% bonus "helps the region more" what do oyu mean by it?


[28-Oct-21 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	better to have 25% for 50% of the people than 10 on 100


[28-Oct-21 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	and to be honest i think there is more than half of the people oding agri


[28-Oct-21 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	your logic is flawed loupdu25. most ppl who have agri here, also have eighter ressource extractors and/or food. so sokme people would get more worth from pio than going into 1 spec.


[28-Oct-21 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	i mean extractor isnt really important, you can run on 1 for quite some time. and for FP you usually have less of them tha, farm


[28-Oct-21 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	i think bonuses are multiplicative too so :p


[28-Oct-21 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	for exemple if you have 5 farm with at a +25% you have 125% i total added but if you go for the 10 you have only 50 + 20-30 for the FP's


[28-Oct-21 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	i know it dont work like this but its imaged


[28-Oct-21 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	you are aware that C production also benefit from Ressource Extraction. and i guess we also have some here doing it. If going into 1 Spec like agri gives the better benefit, i am ok with that. I just want to check why you think so and if it is really true and not that somone wants the max benefit out of it but it would not be the best for all on nem


[28-Oct-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	C is a niche atm i feel like


[28-Oct-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	considering RAT price you get more than from selling C


[28-Oct-21 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	for the same agri input*


[28-Oct-21 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	that is not the point what sells more


[28-Oct-21 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	it is


[28-Oct-21 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	the goal is to increase as much as possible the development of the planet


[28-Oct-21 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	more money = more prefabs bought


[28-Oct-21 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	nope it isnt. i mean if it is oyur only base and you need to generate income... sure :) but many of us have more than one planet and have build ressource chains. if you only look into make more money, why arent you than on promitor or pyrgos?


[28-Oct-21 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	so why building an industry on a planet that will clearly focus on something esle ? at least at the begenning


[28-Oct-21 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	and i wanted a planet with low- med population that it

**hunwyn**:	Oh wow.... Rations crashed


[28-Oct-21 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-21 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	If everyone who is given the choice between making C and making RAT chose to make C, suddenly RAT would be the more profitable of the two. What likely happens is some people choose to build for flexibility while others build for specialization.


[28-Oct-21 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-21 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	like i said, i would be 100% ok going agri, i just wanted to make up your minds, that maybe other use different areas and we should check, what is best for most people.


[28-Oct-21 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	There's actually a way we can guage *exactly* how much each one is worth


[28-Oct-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	or at least MJewkes can.


[28-Oct-21 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Okay, maybe exactly is a strong word, but basically you'd see a tax difference based on how effective each plan is


[28-Oct-21 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	trouble is people are expanding, so that's going to throw things off


[28-Oct-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ExponentRelic3**:	Food processors pay more in taxes than agriculture does by virtue of area. So taxes aren't entirely accurate.


[28-Oct-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ExponentRelic3**:	Oh, I see what you're saying. That might work, I don't feel like dedicating the mental energy to ensuring it would.

[29-Oct-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Thx. I had for a few days. Its a general question. If I know someone is here producing it, I dont buy it. Otherwise I just buy bigger quantities then.


[29-Oct-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm producing it here but mostly to use on Emenator.


[29-Oct-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I make a pretty significant surplus though


[29-Oct-21 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	the *plan* was to sell the excess on emenator, but for a world that has tons of ALO and LST, nobody's buying C for smelters

[29-Oct-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**loupdu25**:	when do you repair ? what % do you wait ?


[01-Nov-21 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Nov-21 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	90 days seems to be fine. I feel for food processor it should be even a bit before. One of my FPs on day 101 or so was at 68 % efficiency. Comparing some buildings they somehow differ a bit in % even if it is the same day.

**mjewkes**:	Posted a couple NEM->Ben ads


[01-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	BEN --> NEM soon


[02-Nov-21 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Is there anyone here that runs a PP3?


[02-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	on nem i guess not but on gibson


[02-Nov-21 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	there is 1 tech on NEM so there aint any PP3s


[02-Nov-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	You have a PP3 on Gibson @Platypet?


[02-Nov-21 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	There are a few PP3s on Gibson


[02-Nov-21 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ExponentRelic3**:	oh someone mentioned them, you want to repair your FP\s before the 60 day mark.


[02-Nov-21 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	90% is when i believe they are best repaired


[02-Nov-21 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ExponentRelic3**:	So 90 days is when productivity falls off. Material consumption is rounded against you. full mat cycle is 180 days, that means every 60 days, one fab is consumed for repairs from an FP.


[02-Nov-21 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	hmm i see, well ive just actually done the repair my shit run, so hopefully everything will be 100% in a day or 2


[03-Nov-21 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	@AceXephon I am running two PP3 on Gibson. Why are you asking?


[03-Nov-21 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Hey Taiyi, I just pm'd you.


[03-Nov-21 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Is 90% the point at which everything should be repaired or is that just for food processors?


[03-Nov-21 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	That's for all buildings


[03-Nov-21 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Competition for the next election ?


[03-Nov-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	How why what ?


[03-Nov-21 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	@piboy what changes do you plan on implementing if you win?


[03-Nov-21 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That's the thing, I don't plan to win, I am only running (jokingly) because mjewkes is running (through a bug) on Gibson


[03-Nov-21 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Maybe in a period or two I might consider running here or elsewhere, but I want a break from COGC taxes for a while.


[03-Nov-21 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Aaa I see


[03-Nov-21 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Now's your time to become the king of the galaxy @Mjewkes! Before they fix the bug


[03-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Hahaha, It literally throws me an "invalid argument" error when I try to withdraw from the race.


[03-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Anyway, if anyone wants anything different from me, feel free to ask.


[03-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	I'm likely going to lower taxes again when I replenish the buffer from what we paid Couch for the WAR (which was at a huge discount because Couch is awesome)


[03-Nov-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Anyone happen to be flying home from BEN right now?


[03-Nov-21 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Happy to pay a premium for a shipping contract, but needs to get here within ~18 hours or so


[03-Nov-21 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Disregard - all taken care of now


[05-Nov-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	wow. FF.CI1 hit 23.99


[05-Nov-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	haven't seen that in many months


[05-Nov-21 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Yeah I think someone has been messing with the FF and SF markets recently. A similar thing occurred a week or two ago and it took the markets a while to normalize again


[05-Nov-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	at the moment, at least, you can buy cheap SF in Benten, ship it to Moria and trade it for cheap(ish) FF


[05-Nov-21 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I'm sure they're going to hit Moria too. I think Ben not and ant all got hit during the last attack


[05-Nov-21 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Ben, mor, and ant*


[05-Nov-21 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Looking at the charts it looks like the last attack occurred around 10/27. Ben Mor and Hort FF prices all skyrocketed and Ant FF prices dropped like a rock 1-2 days after


[05-Nov-21 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	seems like someone wants lower FF prices in Ant


[05-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I have 600 FF in store... if anyone is interessted in buying it :-)


[06-Nov-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	I saw some people argueing about HE3 in global a few days ago, that might have been the cause

**Aufricer**:	Is there still space on that trip ?


[08-Nov-21 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I could send smaller shipping


[08-Nov-21 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	15t/20t or 40 t)


[08-Nov-21 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Also cut taxes from 18->15.


[08-Nov-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mjewkes**:	Very likely to cut it again again next week - aiming to maintain a 60k buffer, and cost of maintenance and no more.


[08-Nov-21 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	My ship will arrive at ben only in a few minutes


[11-Nov-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So basically yes, still room to take goods


[11-Nov-21 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	15 min to be exact.  I may wait there a bit (dinner break) and check in 1h or 2h latest before I start


[11-Nov-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	np ill make some small shipping contract

[11-Nov-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	Probably everyone else has an excel worksheet already but if you don't... I have an excel worksheet where you can plug in current prices and it will tell you how much you can afford to expand and give you a shopping list for construction. Right now I'm just using FRM, FP, RIG, and HB1's.


[11-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@couch - I alredy left. Someone else has to pick your goods.


[11-Nov-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I can grab it. I have a ship that'll be on Nem in 3ish days.


[11-Nov-21 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	If you've got some extra room I'm scrambling to correct a mistake I made and will probably need more goods transported from BEN


[11-Nov-21 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I'll have a little over 300t available


[11-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It's like 6 prefabs total. shouldn't take more than 50t


[11-Nov-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	How quickly will you need them here?


[11-Nov-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	You said 3 days, but I can pay extra for express if you're up to it


[11-Nov-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	3 days is probably the earliest I'd be able to make.


[11-Nov-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Nov-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**mjewkes**:	Hey all - I've had some personal life stuff come up, so I'm going to have to withdraw from the governor election. Sorry for the short notice. I will pass on the savings buffer account to the next governor


[14-Nov-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It started out as a joke, but I would be willing to run and take over for a term or two, deferring back to you if you can run next time of course


[14-Nov-21 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Generally, I'd keep the SST supplied with 1-2 inputs and keep the COGC fed, with taxes at their current level or lower.


[14-Nov-21 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	: ( I hope everything's alright @mjewkes. I would be good with piboy taking over in your stead.

[14-Nov-21 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-21 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**mjewkes**:	I'm going to be voting for Ryst for the next governor - he was the first to land here, and kickstarted the building of the ADM, and I've generally found him reliable, industrious, and trustworthy. That'll be it from me though :) Happy snap election


[14-Nov-21 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ryst has my endorsement too! They'll lead the planet in a good direction.


[15-Nov-21 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Thanks for the votes of confidence. 🙂  Assuming I do end up taking residence in the governor's mansion—I've heard it's actually a rather modest condo overlooking the famously beautiful "Nemesis sulfur pools"—you can expect pretty much the same as with mjewkes... as low of taxes as possible to finance upkeep of the SST and COGC and any other POPI additions or upgrades that are deemed necessary. And upkeep materials will, as much as possible, be purchased from producers here. I may also throw a random "dad joke" into the planetary chat occasionally because it's my M.O. (Sorry in advance.) 🤷‍♂️


[15-Nov-21 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	... just for the protocoll. I did the first contribution for the ADM, but I agree to the points you are going to say


[15-Nov-21 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Correct. mjewkes, Couch, and I got the LM going originally. I did some behind-the-scenes contributions to the ADM (see Taiyi Bureau).


[15-Nov-21 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	On a related note, that LM seems *so* long ago... back before we were even a starter planet and had to walk uphill both ways in the pouring rain to get to work at the farms.


[15-Nov-21 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I remember how expensive fuel was at thattime... with only two hand full of players def. a harder life


[15-Nov-21 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Taiyi**:	Getting Nemesis to be a starter planet was a huge boost!


[15-Nov-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lord_Becket**:	Indeed, In Nemesis the grind is supreme


[16-Nov-21 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	As someone who just recently started in Nemesis as my starter planet, it's actually a nice starter.  It's convenient to be able to produce 2 of the 3 things my people need directly.


[16-Nov-21 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	agreed! try not to fly too often, though, as the fuel costs add up quick


[16-Nov-21 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	I've already figured that out.  1/3 of a tank of FTL fuel each round-trip to BEN.  I've made one trip to expand and get overalls, but am saving up for a bigger haul now.


[16-Nov-21 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	(expand as in add more FRM and FP)


[16-Nov-21 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm probably going to wind up tanking the price of water in BEN


[16-Nov-21 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	H2O specifically


[16-Nov-21 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	1050 units/day, I was selling to Mjewkes but he had to run


[16-Nov-21 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Anyone still selling FF here?


[16-Nov-21 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Daemeus occasionally puts up FF orders here


[16-Nov-21 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Usually they just drop on the LM with no real fanfare


[16-Nov-21 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I currently produce small amounts (going to move it to another location) mainly for using it myself. How much would you need ?


[16-Nov-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I have such a need for FABS that until now I could not increase/move the production of FF. But maybe soon (esp. if the FF price stays high like recently).

[16-Nov-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Would it be also an idea to have auctions for the upkeep on NEM ? Is there enough active players interessted and willing to participate ? As it would need a certain time and also organization (join discord, join channel, prepare all that stuff, know about the time, do the auction etc. etc.)

**Kevinfu510**:	Hello! just want to ask whether Collectors collect Nitrogen on NEM


[16-Nov-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	No, NEM has only H2O, SCR, and O - of which only the oxygen is gathered by a Collector


[16-Nov-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kevinfu510**:	aah okay, thanks for the answer Zizzle! was planning on getting Nutrient Solution production up and running, guess you can't make everything on your own, hehe


[16-Nov-21 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	and someone earlier was saying that N had completely sold out on 3 of the 4 CXs, so even buying it right now might be hard

[16-Nov-21 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kevinfu510**:	was looking at expansion paths I can take


[16-Nov-21 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kevinfu510**:	main export of mine has been C and RCO for the past month


[16-Nov-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	At least with RCO, if NS prices go through the roof, you can just switch to the other RCO recipe


[16-Nov-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	but maybe there's other more profitable farm options instead


[16-Nov-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kevinfu510**:	I was looking at Hydroponics as a possible branch to expand to, was using the non NS recipe for RCO


[16-Nov-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	oh, I see. That makes sense for needing the NS


[16-Nov-21 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Right now I have 38, but in 11h I will have 200 more.  Price is 95/u.


[17-Nov-21 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	well


[17-Nov-21 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	i guess if i cancelled stuff now I'd  have about 200 more


[17-Nov-21 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	If I cancel everything now I have 275.


[17-Nov-21 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	1) I occasionaly produce NS here but small small quantities. @AceXephon will produce N (on another location) soon. 2) I will start a COF production here soon or will export COF from another base to the CX 3) I may be interessted to buy one or 2 DDT in foreseenable future to in the end produce some "MED"


[17-Nov-21 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For the NS. If someone is in urgent need. I could spare 20 units


[17-Nov-21 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Thats an expensive RAT. 350.000.00 CIS. What is it made from ?


[17-Nov-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	lol. It's a 350 caRAT... uh, RAT. (Really, just cash transfer.)


[18-Nov-21 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Congratulations to our new Governor, Ryst


[18-Nov-21 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Thanks, @hunwyn.


[18-Nov-21 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'll look into planning for the COGC & SST upkeep this weekend. In the meantime, please DM me if you produce any of the upkeep materials—RAT, DW, MCG, PE, OFF, SUN—as the general plan is to buy as much as possible from Nemesis residents.


[18-Nov-21 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ExponentRelic3**:	Anyone got ~20 DW they can sell? Forgot workers need things like "water" to work.


[18-Nov-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	yes


[18-Nov-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	35ea?


[18-Nov-21 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ExponentRelic3**:	Fantastic, thank you muchly.


[18-Nov-21 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	happy to help


[18-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I can make sun


[18-Nov-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Have 40 units now


[18-Nov-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	I can make some SUN too


[18-Nov-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	well i have 20 on the CX if you want them


[18-Nov-21 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	FTL Fuel almost 20 at BEN, even higher at MOR???? bruh thats insane


[18-Nov-21 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	wait no reversed, 19 at MOR, 20 at BEN, still insane


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Yeppers, it was even higher a few days ago


[18-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	really??, thats like business killing prices


[18-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	lucky i have 500 in storage for emergencies


[18-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	but wow


[18-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	There's not enough supply for the demand


[18-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	seems so


[18-Nov-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	my finance tab is gonna go all red for this period lmao


[18-Nov-21 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Mine is red every week and yet I grow


[18-Nov-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	just build a ref yesterday 😏


[18-Nov-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	built*


[18-Nov-21 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Also, if anyone is growing CAF here, I will buy some from time to time on the LM.


[18-Nov-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kevinfu510**:	sucks I can't access the LM


[18-Nov-21 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kevinfu510**:	(no company rating)


[18-Nov-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	$8 for pro will fix that


[19-Nov-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I am sure that everybody - not only @opie is about to increase production.


[19-Nov-21 02:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Where will you get the inputs from ? You own a HE3 production ?


[19-Nov-21 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will start COF/CAF production soon. I have all the material ready. Just to need to ship it in plus my biggest problem: I am not sure what I scrap down for it, as I have no space at all.


[19-Nov-21 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	I buy HE3 on the cx


[19-Nov-21 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	https://i.imgur.com/CPuzVvP.png and I got H for 75/u from derelict.

[19-Nov-21 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I can provide h2o for your cof production if you wanf


[19-Nov-21 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Want* to tear down some rigs


[19-Nov-21 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I think I will tear down my O2 collector. Yes I need a few O but honestly. It produces more then I can consume and price for O is so bad. For me it seems less profitable. Or other things might have a potential  for more profit. For the H20. I have the feeling with COF eating a lot of it (and also for the DW) I may (no promiss) stock up from here from time to time.


[19-Nov-21 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Well i make enough to crash the market on ben. Let me know if you need any. Im also maming way too much o


[19-Nov-21 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@Flugeidechse, check your PM for your shippment


[19-Nov-21 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	Could anyone use some spare HCP, MCG, C, O, or SCR immediately?  I accidentally let my base storage fill up, i have no room for more production until my ship arrives in 24 hours


[19-Nov-21 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	Willing to give great deals to free up storage space!


[19-Nov-21 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	I'd also be willing to buy it back from you in about 24 hours


[19-Nov-21 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	how much for scr?


[19-Nov-21 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	i also have 500 t/m3 of storage you can rent @Daemeus


[19-Nov-21 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I am willing to help out for free. 500t - i dont care what.


[19-Nov-21 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	*slaps forehead*, i forgot warehouses existed


[19-Nov-21 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	problem solved lol


[19-Nov-21 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	good


[19-Nov-21 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	What can i say except youre welcome =p


[19-Nov-21 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	For the fabs, the SUN, the WAR


[19-Nov-21 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome


[19-Nov-21 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Couch's just an ordinary demi-guy


[19-Nov-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	hah


[20-Nov-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Hey @everyone... While I'm sure the rest of us all appreciate the generosity of anyone directly donating to the COGC or POPI (@AussieSpaceman and @reQber), please choose to make a profit by selling your goods instead!


[20-Nov-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	What do I mean by that? Great question... Thanks for asking. 🙂


[20-Nov-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	We all pay taxes here already. That money will be used to buy goods (preferably from people on this planet) to fill those usage requirements.


[20-Nov-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Rest assured that the requirements will be filled on a regular basis!


[20-Nov-21 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If you have any questions, please ask! Either here or by DM'ing the governor. (Currently, that's me. Previously it was @mjewkes.)


[20-Nov-21 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	On that note, only a couple people have DM'd me about goods that they sell which fill these needs. If you sell PE, MCG, DW, OFF, or SUN; have overstock that you are willing to sell; and have not yet DM'd me... please do so! Thanks!


[20-Nov-21 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	How will you do th buying ? A bit above I asked everybody about their oppinion to use the UFO discord auctions. In short: Complicated, everybody know how/can use it ? But would be an option.


[20-Nov-21 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Probably just something on the LM. I'm planning to look into/consider options later today or tomorrow when I have some time.


[22-Nov-21 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	Can you list what prices you are willing to pay for those things?  I can make OFF and SUN if I am guaranteed to sell them, but I'd rather not otherwise because they tend to just sit around for a long time.


[22-Nov-21 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Could just post LM ads as they're needed, I check all my LMs pretty much daily


[22-Nov-21 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	or alternatively put the ads up with a long deadline so i have time to make them and get them here.


[22-Nov-21 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	pretty much that yeah


[22-Nov-21 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I looked into the UFOBot auction set-up, and it looks pretty cool. For this time, I'll connect with anyone who DM'd me (doing so after I hit "enter" here). After this upkeep cycle, I'll run auctions and post the relevant links here.


[22-Nov-21 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	On that note, thanks @Aufricer for the heads up about it. 🙂


[22-Nov-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Most items procured for this round of upkeep for COGC & 30 days' worth for the SST. Just waiting for shipping...


[22-Nov-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ah, I pushed off from Gibson this morning. Should have asked if anything was needed


[22-Nov-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Auction sound advanced. Interessting if you (we) give it a try. Not even sure if I myself will be participating.


[22-Nov-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	But not for the auction, cause I have no capacity to fill in the needs


[22-Nov-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Allow me a bit of advertisement. I will start COF production here in a few h. I have a high consumption of my own but there might be a surplus.


[22-Nov-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Is there in general a interest ? If so I can offer smaller quantities (5 units, 10 ? 15?) from time to time. Maybe CX price or a bit below. Otherwise nevermind, I will ship it to the CX for sale.


[22-Nov-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I could use some COF from time to time


[22-Nov-21 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Well, I'm all about trying reasonable-sounding ideas to see how they fly and then either going all in if they work or scrapping it if they don't.


[22-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I think the auction will be different the first time, but after that it should be fairly easy. We'll see, I guess.


[22-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'll probably run the auction for a month's supply of both POPI and COGC upkeep. I have a couple other ideas, but I'll wait to explain them until everything is in place (should make more sense that way).


[22-Nov-21 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If all works out, taxes may even drop a little more...


[22-Nov-21 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I'm all for cheaper taxes


[22-Nov-21 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	An entire month's supply is a substantial amount. I guess with enough lead time to fulfill the auction it could be okay. Some very-high-volume stuff might need to be broken into smaller lots.


[22-Nov-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'd actually expect to award contracts to 1-3 people per material (depending on the quantity and number of bidders). So it shouldn't be terrible. That will all be specified in the auction detail.


[22-Nov-21 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Comparatively speaking, taxes on Nemesis are reasonably low already (but I'm still for lowering them more, if possible). Etherwind is the only CIM faction planet that is less. Proxion has some industries at a lower rate and others at a much higher rate. Gibson, Katoa, and Umbra, along with any other planets in CIM space that don't have ADMs, all have higher taxes. Just an FYI for anyone who cares. 🙂


[22-Nov-21 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	im always happy with less taxes, but whatever it takes to keep the planet stable and prosperous


[22-Nov-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Pi, did you mean to vote for Education: Scientists here on Nemesis? We only have 1 TEC and 0 ENG


[22-Nov-21 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Just for fun :P


[22-Nov-21 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	ah, ok :)


[22-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I had enough influence to tip it any which way, so I did so for a couple minutes it seems


[22-Nov-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	lol


[23-Nov-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Shipping ads are up if anyone has the space and wants to cover some of their own shipping costs.


[23-Nov-21 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	581 tons?


[23-Nov-21 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	hang on


[23-Nov-21 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	woops, i need to pay more attention


[23-Nov-21 06:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	lemme break that up


[23-Nov-21 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	used to being able to bulk sell my water here, didn't think about how much it weighed vs how much can be shipped


[23-Nov-21 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Split it into 3, should be actually managable now


[23-Nov-21 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	unfortunately, all my ships bound for nemesis end up at etherwind


[23-Nov-21 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Not a problem. Thanks for catching my mistake so I could fix it before I logged out


[23-Nov-21 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm assuming 5 CIS/ton is a reasonable rate.


[23-Nov-21 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	hmm


[23-Nov-21 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Saw it offered on Emenitor, so I just kinda went with it


[23-Nov-21 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I usually just say "Screw it" and throw a random number at it


[23-Nov-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	the most i've seen is 12k for inter-cx shipments


[23-Nov-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**opie**:	well 3k i guess is fair enough but only if someone has a reason to come out here


[23-Nov-21 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Did a little math, assuming FTL sells for 20 and STL sells for 10 (high, i know) and the round trip costs 50 FTL 100 STL then it'd be about 4k for a round trip, so I should probably pay more


[23-Nov-21 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I can't get exact figures at the moment, don't have a ship in position to check


[23-Nov-21 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	5/ton covers one-way with a small profit, which isn't good for the one doing the shipping.


[23-Nov-21 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	New ads posted at a better rate


[23-Nov-21 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Dreadnott** left.*


[23-Nov-21 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Seems Im late for the party. What was your rate now ? (Yes 50 FF and 100 SF one direction is an good estimate).


[23-Nov-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I doubled it up to 10/t. Overpaying, but it gives incentive for people to pick it up even if they don't have anything to bring bakck


[23-Nov-21 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	back*


[23-Nov-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	as a full ship at that rate will net you a 1000 CIS profit there and back if you come back empty


[23-Nov-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Which you shouldn't


[23-Nov-21 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	IMO a fair price would be something like 7/ton


[23-Nov-21 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	5/t covers costs, but doens't really pay for the time the ship is in space.


[23-Nov-21 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Also there's entirely the possibility that I'm overestimating how generous you should be when hiring a transport.


[23-Nov-21 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Similar to me. I could use like 1 ship each two or 3 days but often send my own and decide for smaller packages (like 40t/80t) to offer here. Often it is picked but not always so I am not sure if people are going or not. And @Couch I took 100 water earlier but someone else sold it to me.


[23-Nov-21 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@All a lot of prices are low currently (got Lst for 35, PE is at below 3 and few other things as well). Is it overproduction ?


[23-Nov-21 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Probably, the most active industries are low tech, more users flood in there


[23-Nov-21 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm trying to start producing high tech consumables, encourage people to tech up


[23-Nov-21 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It's hard to do Technicians without the support of a corp right now


[23-Nov-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Yeah, it looks like the current cost of a Tech per day is about double that of a SET per day


[23-Nov-21 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	and that's assuming the product is even *available8


[23-Nov-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Tech consumables are complex


[23-Nov-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Even me, I will try to tech up. But you need to have a way to finance it.


[23-Nov-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I've committed a whole planet to them and only got one building per consumable type


[23-Nov-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I found tech consumables overpriced. Thats why soon I will start to make my own "MED"


[23-Nov-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I actually want to pull the prices down for that very reason


[23-Nov-21 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I have no intention of selling them at cost, i have to make a profit after all, but I'll sell them as cheaply as I think I can get away with


[23-Nov-21 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	That also raises the problem of driving people out of the market


[23-Nov-21 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Yeah - maybe I have to revert my NEM base back to SCR mining but a full base would be like 15 EXT (?) or approx. 3.000 SCR a day. A ship can take 220 of them :-o


[23-Nov-21 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	But at least it would give cash for the other stuff


[23-Nov-21 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	One EXT right now can supply an entire CX with S by itself


[23-Nov-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Couch, are you setup to make MED currently? I have a WPL here, I could produce COT for you if you aren't already setup for it


[23-Nov-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Currently I only have WPLs and EXT built on my new base, and no housing to run them


[23-Nov-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	The actual blueprint for the new base is on my main computer, and I'm kinda in the wrong country right now


[23-Nov-21 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	won't be able to access it for another 2 weeks and I don't wanna do the math again


[23-Nov-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Do you have it on a copy of Rain's MBP?


[23-Nov-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Nope. I've been doing the math for myself. I should probably do the Rain thing and save myself some time


[23-Nov-21 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	That's what I do, and since it's a google sheet I can access it from my phone too. I prefer to get it all setup on my computer though


[23-Nov-21 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I actually spent like 4 hours walking back through the recipes and figuring out the product/minute for each recipe.


[23-Nov-21 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	and getting all the ratios


[23-Nov-21 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	don't wanna do the math again


[23-Nov-21 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	And yeah, the spreadsheet would probably help me there


[23-Nov-21 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	lol yeah that would be a pain. Rain's sheet does a pretty good job calculating all that automatically


[23-Nov-21 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	for now I'm going to be using my WPLs to make NL.


[23-Nov-21 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	which I can use to make LSE... I think it's LSE. Which ever it was.


[23-Nov-21 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	NL is *super overcosted* right now for the materials and time


[23-Nov-21 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	LDE I beleive


[23-Nov-21 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	believe*


[23-Nov-21 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It's like 50 PG/unit and is selling for 4k/unit.


[23-Nov-21 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	it's why LDE is such a big bottleneck


[23-Nov-21 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	yeppers. That's what I've currently been using mine for and occasionally COT


[23-Nov-21 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It's just not worth it for me to buy it when I can manufacture it... hell, it might actually be cheaper to just build a WPL than it is to buy 10 NL


[23-Nov-21 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Build a WPL and *make* 10 NL I mean


[23-Nov-21 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Yeah, it's definitely a shame that prices are so inflated on the higher tier products. That's why a lot of people choose to grow their bases vertically, but that in turn just causes the inflated prices to remain


[23-Nov-21 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I do try to make sure I'm only selling finished products whenever possible


[23-Nov-21 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	They just sell more reliably than components


[23-Nov-21 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	There are instances where it makes sense to have some vertical growth of a base, but I feel there's a lot of bases that take it to the extreme


[23-Nov-21 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Yeah. I buy intermediate products where I can, Silicon, Glass, that sort of thing... also all my consumables. Somebody's gotta get all that stuff off of the market after all =P


[23-Nov-21 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	lol yeppers


[23-Nov-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Welp I'm about to hit another milestone in my PrUn career. Just purchased all the materials to repair my very first FRMs and RIGS


[23-Nov-21 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Nice


[23-Nov-21 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Dont remind me. Pumped like 30 fabs and 200 MCG into repairs but still need the same amount again. A few productions are still down to 90 % efficiency :-(


[23-Nov-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I think I dopped over 120 bse on repairs last month


[23-Nov-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Had like 20 rigs at 40 percent


[23-Nov-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	lol if this game had sound effects for bases, yours would've just been a constant screeching sound


[23-Nov-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Yeah, i dont really keep track of upkeep very well. Thats why i buy supplies once a month


[23-Nov-21 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	I just have a rolling spreedsheet for my PIOs upkeep and then remember once every 2 months that buildings degrade aswell


[23-Nov-21 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I carefully min/max my building repairs, computing the best day to repair, but I'm a bit crazy that way.


[23-Nov-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I would like to do that. How many days does a building degrade for before it has no reclaimable parts? 180?


[23-Nov-21 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Yes, roughly. Though sometimes the game gives some buildings an extra 7d for some reason


[23-Nov-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Sorry, I should say it seems to be exactly 180d for complete loss except for the 7d weirdness


[23-Nov-21 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	You can use the MCG to judge the % wear to determine when the next set of fabs will break


[23-Nov-21 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Nice! I'll have to setup a spreadsheet for it


[23-Nov-21 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That is indeed one tool where no sheet exists yet, because of the weirdness we observe


[23-Nov-21 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AussieSpaceman**:	schrodingers degradation


[24-Nov-21 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	just placed an overprice offer for some MCG guys :)


[24-Nov-21 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	ty


[24-Nov-21 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Just a quick reminder—mostly a heads up for anyone who hasn't read chat lately—to *not* contribute to the COGC/SST upkeep. Supplies have been purchased with tax money and are on their way. 🙂


[24-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	So on that degradation weirdness, it looks like my RIG and 2 Farms I built last week all received the free week.


[24-Nov-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Technically it says they were built 8 days ago, so more than a week so far


[24-Nov-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Yeah. I guess just be happy you were blessed :)


[24-Nov-21 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Have there been any commonalities identified on when it occurs? It doesn't look like it's related to when the popr comes out. They were built within 12 hours from when the next consumption event would've occurred, but I don't see that having any effect. The only thing all three would've had in common was that recurring orders were immediately queued as soon as they were built


[24-Nov-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	There were server issues on the day that they were built, but the issues started about 8 hours before they were built, so they should've been resolved by then


[24-Nov-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I haven't formulated any theories yet


[24-Nov-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Just a guess. Like consumption. Once a thing is created/started a timer ticks. And maybe its the same as fuel consumption. You can have different times for the same usage of fuel. At least thats why sometimes I close the "travel screen" and open it again, to have the better consumption times again. There is a few things in here, that is a bit freaky or nerdy made. Could be the same for depreciation.


[24-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Waff**:	Add posted for FF fuel if anyone can spare some


[25-Nov-21 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Nov-21 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm like... |----| this close to breaking down and brute forcing the next two Warehouse upgrades so I can rent another unit.


[26-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	Is your Nem base already using up 3 permits?


[26-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Only got one plot on NEM, been using my permits to expand to other planets


[26-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Couch** deleted this message.*


[26-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I could probably dismantle something and use some space for a warehouse of my own but...


[26-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	(Or actually commit a ship here instead of emenator.)


[26-Nov-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	...can we not rent more than one unit? It used to be 3 in the last universe. Didn't realize they changed it.


[26-Nov-21 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Need to upgrade it to rent more

[27-Nov-21 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	Is it generally advisable to fully fill out your first base before attempting to expand to a second planet?


[27-Nov-21 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	Like, as in filling out the full 500/500 area?


[27-Nov-21 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	maybe not to squeeze out every last spot, but generally, yeah


[27-Nov-21 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	In fact, there's something to be said for using permits to expand to 1000 area before making a new base. They take a lot of startup capital to both build and stock with inventory


[27-Nov-21 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Core module by itself is ~70k last I checked, plus you want at least a couple of habs and production buildings, enough consumables to last a while, and enough inputs for your production buildings. So I'd say expect 120k+ to just get a small new base started.


[27-Nov-21 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	Oh wow... didn't realize the core module was that expensive.  I'll keep that in mind for planning purposes.  I'm only at around 250/500 area used just yet, so I've still got some time to plan before I have to decide what to do.


[27-Nov-21 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Anybody need anything shipped from BEN to MOR? It turns out that my ship passes right through there on it's way to my 3rd base


[27-Nov-21 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	If you go that way in general ? I may send (not now) stuff. I have not been in MOR since weeks but would need to get some NCCs from time to time.


[27-Nov-21 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And for your storage problem. For me it seems, that NEM is a product with a lot of high mass/volume products. I nearly never have empty space coming from here but started to have space on my way to come. So only hope is to have someone that is willing to transport or go by yourself


[27-Nov-21 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I basically fly by there every 3-5 days.

[27-Nov-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Back on the WAR upgrade topic... @Couch, I think it might be a better option to build a STO (either demo'ing some other buildings or using an extra permit here to get more space) than to expand the WAR since there are currently only 7 units rented... JMO.


[27-Nov-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	and a single STO is 5000/5000, same as renting 10 (!) warehouse units


[27-Nov-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Yeah, I just don't like the idea of tearing something down for a warehouse even if it is sensable.


[27-Nov-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	but I probably will if it stays a problem for too long


[28-Nov-21 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	yeah, didn't have that much. Put up an ad for a smaller amount


[04-Dec-21 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	I can probably organize to handle that one, too, but I'll need to wait until my ship arrives in 7h before I decide. If no one else has grabbed it by then, I'll see if I can.

**Ryst**:	After a couple weeks, I'm getting a handle on taxes, upkeep, and population. Lowered the taxes on all industries. Previously was 15 across the board. Now is 12 for Ag and 8 for all the rest (since Ag benefits from the COGC bonus). Will see what this does for taxes and adjust accordingly in a week or two.


[07-Dec-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Dec-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I was momentarily a little concerned about population growth, but after seeing POPR for this week I think we're OK for now. May have to bump up the SST if we get an influx of new players, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.


[07-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Dec-21 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Also, if anyone wants to go the extra mile, I'd be willing to pay premium to ship to MOR from here.


[08-Dec-21 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	not *immediately* but in a day or so when I have more water


[08-Dec-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I have an ad up on the BEN LM for a small 9.3t shipment that's going to MOR


[08-Dec-21 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	It wouldn't yield you the same amount of profit that you would get from 9.3t of H2O would earn you though, so no worries if you don't want to pick it up


[08-Dec-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Let me do a quick check on how much fuel it'd take to get from NEM to MOR. I just want to come up with a reasonable price to pay for shipping 500t to MOR from here.


[08-Dec-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	though 500t isn't actually that reasonable if you arrive at MOR and have no NCC to refuel.


[08-Dec-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	lol I misread your message. I thought you were saying that you would ship from Nem -> MOR. Apparently I need more coffee. I deal with both NCC and CIS, so if you wanted to do the Nem -> MOR contract in NCC that would be fine


[08-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm just now getting established in NCC, so I don't have much.


[08-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	If I can sell the 2k ish H2O i have there though I'll be sitting pretty


[08-Dec-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Makes me wonder what the DW prices are like


[08-Dec-21 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	ah, not great


[08-Dec-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I should have enough NCC sitting around to be able to at least get me back to BEN. So a CIS order would work too if you can't do it in NCC


[08-Dec-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AceXephon**:	I just put up a couple ads for some RAT if anyone has some to sell. One already got picked up. I also have about 200t remaining on my BEN -> NEM ship. I'll be leaving in about an hour if anyone has anything they need brought over.

**Aufricer**:	Hello everyonehere: Finally I am at a point where I consider to change my production focus again.


[11-Dec-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Just asking: If I amgoing to buy Water - a lot of water - what would be the best ?


[11-Dec-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Doing smaller bits of lets say 100 or better 1.000?


[11-Dec-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	and before you ask - Ido not know yet how much I need. I have no exact calculation so far. As this depends on the other factor: Are I am going to buy or to make DW


[11-Dec-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	is there also someone here, that would produce DW in bigger quantities (Just an assumption between 100 and 200 a day for my bases)


[11-Dec-21 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	also i stole the whole pioneer pool.  sorry.


[14-Dec-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	you can't steal it all only a percentage you can access ;)


[14-Dec-21 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	right now I can still pull 200 pio from pool


[14-Dec-21 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**derelict.**:	luckily only a day and a half until popr


[14-Dec-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	pool is kinda divided evenly I think pool / nr of players


[14-Dec-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	that would make sense.  in the meantime i'll live with 400/960 workers for a couple of days :)


[14-Dec-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	there were like 3k pio in pool but seems you can only acess like 7% of that


[14-Dec-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	or something like that :D


[14-Dec-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aldin**:	maybe 5% if my bad is bad and it usually is


[14-Dec-21 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	well i got my 200 for free and then another 200, so 6.66%, close enough :)

[14-Dec-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ryst**:	Since we have some new players and I haven't mentioned it in awhile... No need for anyone to contribute to the COGC or POPI upkeep. That's what our tax income is used for.


[19-Dec-21 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	And on that note, I'm going to be soliciting some bids for mats for an upgrade to the SST. With new folks and derelict hiring a bunch of PIOs, it seems like we need some faster growth. (1.6% unemployment is not a good thing...)


[19-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	OK, I've created a few auctions in the UFO Bot:


[19-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If you are not subscribed to that Discord channel, here is an invitation: https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP


[19-Dec-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Review the "auction-information" channel for details on how to bid in the auctions.


[19-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Bids should be in the format of: <material> <quantity that you are able to supply> <your unit price offer>


[19-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	(I'll add that info to the next auction... now that I've done it once, I understand the format a little better.)


[19-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Auction IDs are:


[19-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	JS-299A-1 (COGC upkeep)


[19-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	JS-299A-2 (SST upkeep)


[19-Dec-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	JS-299A-3 (SST upgrade)


[19-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	You may bid in any/all auctions for any/all materials. However, only one bid/auction is allowed per the bot. So, if you would like to bid on more than one material, include details for all materials in your bid.


[19-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Bidding for all auctions closes on December 24.


[19-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Great. I will give it a try


[19-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Yeah, I just noticed that too.


[19-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Thats why I came here...


[19-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	For anyone not yet subscribed... Once you join the UFO Discord server (link above in the planetary chat), join the Nemesis channel. You can DM "!help" to the bot for details on all the commands...

[20-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Hey guys - dont forget the auctions for the planetary upkeep! @Ryst, its possible to bid to parts only, right (e.g. there is 500 DW I can bid for 200 DW only ?!)


[20-Dec-21 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Yes, just include only DW in your bid.


[20-Dec-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	A bid should be <material> <quantity you can deliver> <unit price>.


[20-Dec-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	So something like: DW 300 30, MCG 200 14... would only be bids for those two materials.


[20-Dec-21 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	... for "providing" those two materials...


[20-Dec-21 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	UFO Discord server invitation (for anyone who isn't on it): https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP


[20-Dec-21 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Then join the Nemesis channels and find (3) auction details in the "nemesis-politics" channel.

[20-Dec-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Dec-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I just somehow need to manage to take the details with me while travelling. Not taking my computers with me but the auction ends while i am away.


[20-Dec-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Not a huge deal, @Aufricer. I can ping you on Discord if it's easier. Materials don't need to be delivered until Jan 1 or 2 (and a little after that shouldn't actually be an issue, if necessary).


[20-Dec-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I have everything on NEM already :-). I will take my discord login with me


[21-Dec-21 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	What is the impression for everyone about the auction ? I liked it: yep its a bit of artificial work but for me it seemed like everyone had a chance to bid for the things. So the time zone and (your) activity dont count.


[28-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	"Negative" point is - you probably cant go lower then the CX price and the price may be very different between the moment you bid and the moment the auction closes


[28-Dec-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	higher.... not lower.

**hunwyn**:	It was interesting. I just put in my bid at the end of the cycle. I'm not in a position yet to start risking losing on the bids yet, so I had to do it based on prices at the end of the auction and the stock I had at the time.


[28-Dec-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Just realized I can also sell 12 x BDE, if needed...


[28-Dec-21 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Dec-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Looks at the empty ship he's about to send to Benten to pick up some stuff...


[28-Dec-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Your timing was brilliant


[28-Dec-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	haha


[28-Dec-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	I have two ships there that just returned from a shipping contract


[28-Dec-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	And I like to keep at least one ship at home. It's only at 32.6/500 right now and I can't imagine filling it more than 100/500


[28-Dec-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Two very small shipping containers up... apologies for the small size... it's literally just something I accidentally left behind because I tried to load my ship from the mobile app :(


[28-Dec-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	haha no worries.


[28-Dec-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	the 1,000 CIS covers more than half of the total shipping costs so I don't feel bad about it.


[28-Dec-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	If it's alright with you I might wait until early tomorrow to depart. Around 10:00 CST. That way if anyone else has something to ship from BEN to NEM they can also get onboard.


[28-Dec-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	still have 450 space.


[28-Dec-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	It's not a rush job. It's just a "I forgot some stuff" :D


[29-Dec-21 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In 4h one of my shipments arrive at Ben. Just write again here before you go so I will see if I can still put something on for shipping

**Arcsecond**:	Yep -- it happens quick.  It took me something like 30-40 days to fill the first half of my available space, and then I filled the rest of it in under two weeks.

[30-Dec-21 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Isn't the cap 500?


[30-Dec-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	You can expand it by using base permits.


[30-Dec-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	Up to 1,000


[30-Dec-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	My limit right now is 750 with a single extra base permit.


[30-Dec-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	It's technically optimal to use a base permit to get an extra base somewhere else, where it would count for 500 more space but I play super casually and I don't want to have two bases to keep track of yet.


[31-Dec-21 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	I am going the route of jumping to a second base elsewhere, but it's been a pain to get the materials for the core module together.  I should finally have what I need to build a new core module and the first three buildings of a new base tomorrow.


[31-Dec-21 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	grats! 63 days is way faster than I managed


[31-Dec-21 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	Thanks!  I wasn't sure what an average time to second base was, honestly.  I've gotten pretty lucky with RAT prices at BEN, though.

[31-Dec-21 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	I'm set up to use the C and O I get from here to fuel refining and so I am headed for Ementior for my second base, since using AL lets me do both lightweight and basic prefabs.

[04-Jan-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	Pay-to-play kinda. Wish this game allowed you to buy membership with in-game currency.


[04-Jan-22 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Lets see how long the game is still around. I would like to know how much it cost to maintain (but dont develope it any further)


[04-Jan-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	Maintenance on a game like this has got to be laughably small. I'd be surprised if it was more than $100/month.


[04-Jan-22 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	That's assuming they are using hosting. If they hosted the game on their own servers (which considering that they have multiple games would make sense) it'd be cheaper than that.


[04-Jan-22 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	If I lived in a location with better internet service options I could run a game like this on my home server for the cost of electricity and internet service which would be around $60/month


[04-Jan-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	That is assuming that they only need servers in one location... Which is a pretty safe assumption because I can't imagine 200 ping having too much of an effect on a game like this.


[04-Jan-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ForumGhost**:	It has to be said again that this is only considering server hosting and not salaries of the game devs.


[06-Jan-22 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jan-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Run


[02-Feb-22 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I am open to vote change :-)


[02-Feb-22 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@SomeRando159, no one except mjewkes ran before I did. And I only ran because he was stepping away, and I figured I'd offer my time since I was the first one to inhabit the planet (342 days ago now). Since I started governing, taxes have been reduced twice (with probably a third drop coming next week), the SST has been upgraded to level 2 (in case we ever need it, which we were close to a few weeks ago), and POPI & COGC upkeep is always up-to-date.


[02-Feb-22 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	So, yeah, totally sounds like KJU.


[02-Feb-22 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Look, we were obviously all new at one point. I certainly messed up plenty in the early days (and probably still now sometimes). So if I can be sold bold as to offer a friendly suggestion: maybe play the game for more than a week before you start mouthing off about topics on which you have minimal experience. 🤷‍♂️


[02-Feb-22 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	Ryst has been remarkably transparent with the finances of the planet and has kept taxes low, but enough to keep things going. If there were concerns about leadership. you can be sure someone else would have run, especially since there's no barrier to running. The thing is,unless whoever runs against Ryst can explain why we need change, I'm going to go with an "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality.


[02-Feb-22 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	*looks awkwardly at Circe*


[02-Feb-22 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	On a more positive note + tying some of this together + updating some people who may not be on Discord...


[02-Feb-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	You can always see our current tax balance with CXOB SF.CI1. Because APEX doesn't (currently) offer any way to separate company finances from governorship finances, I maintain the tax finances as a buy ad (below MM so it can never be filled). When a purchase is made for materials, I pay with my own CIS and then replace ad with the appropriate quantity. And the same applies again at the end of the week when I receive the tax dividends.


[02-Feb-22 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	"materials" meaning upkeep for COGC/POPI


[02-Feb-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	After this week, we should be fairly close to 300k CIS (290-300 or so) with SST & COGC upkeep already paid for some time. So I'll probably lower taxes again (but still keep Ag a little higher than all the rest because of the COGC campaign).


[02-Feb-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	After that, I think we should have some discussions about what we can do here as a group. IMO, Nemesis is one of the best planets in CIM space. We have a great combo of H2O and fertility... Not as much H2O as Etherwind, and not as much of either as Pyrgos. But the *combo* is better than Etherwind, and we're closer to the CX and other CIM planets than Pyrgos by more than half.


[02-Feb-22 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	What other types of things could we be doing here? And how might taxes—which we can't drop to zero because we're in faction space but will likely reach the minimum allowed at some point in the not-too-distant future—be used to help fuel that growth?


[02-Feb-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	I may be able to speak to that if I better understood the health/safety/comfort stuff, but our population report looks like there's something we could do to make our Settlers happier? Does happy = productive? Anyways, I need to look into those systems to better understand them.


[02-Feb-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@hunwyn happier just means more grow, it has no effect on productivity. The happiness is so low because there's high unemployment. If people need settlers and start using up the unemployed people, more will come and happiness will rise on its own


[02-Feb-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That's a key point to understand... Productivity of your workforce/production output is based entirely on (1) a specific production line's condition, (2) experts, (3) hq bonus, and (4) consumables like COF/OVE/PWO. In other words, stuff that's all within your own power to control.


[02-Feb-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Oh, and (possibly, depending on the campaign) the COGC bonus.


[02-Feb-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Everything that you see at the bottom of the POPR (e.g. safety, health, unemployment) only affects the planetary population growth of the specific workforce tiers.


[02-Feb-22 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	The only time that really will affect anyone personally is if you wanted to put up a building that required a specific workforce tier (let's say "Technicians", for example) but there weren't enough of that workforce on the planet to fulfill the building's workforce needs.


[02-Feb-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	So the takeaway... If anyone plans to put up Tech buildings on Nemesis, bring it up here in chat or to me privately so we can start working to build the infrastructure (POPI) to support that workforce tier.


[02-Feb-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hunwyn**:	So, If those things aren't really a bottleneck for us right now, I think the best thing we could do is begin to stockpile the needed components so, when someone is ready to take that step, we can. We already have a better warehouse than Proxion does. I'm not sure what else we can do for it other than keep it running smoothly?


[02-Feb-22 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	At 8ne point I was close to make a tech building here. But since ages I.am back to allmost pioneers only! When I started the game I allmost went bancrupt and as Fuel was no option at that time I restarted here for consumables.


[02-Feb-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	No need for me to do anything fancy or different from farming. Its only 20 pioneers left, next to settlers.


[02-Feb-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The only thing to check is those mysterious government programs tjey announced for the update.


[02-Feb-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	20  settlers of course, next to all pioneers...


[02-Feb-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And like last week - I got my 5th farming expert.


[02-Feb-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Means I have 5 experts in ressources and agri and only 3 categories (construction and electronics among) without any expert. And yes: Nem is and stays a good planet.


[02-Feb-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@PhoenixCorp there's enough unemployment for you to draw more for your buildings.


[03-Feb-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	~1500 available for the taking, and more will come if people start using them up


[03-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PhoenixCorp**:	complete with the safety issues from real life as well


[03-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Has to do with the reserve pool. Latest with next Population update you will get all the pio you need.


[03-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Is @Zizzle still reading with us ? He could be good in explaining. Im just to lazy to go to the documentation and explaination in detail


[03-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Yeah, you can only take so much of the reserve pool. But when the next POPR happens, a full redistribution happens and you'll get topped off.


[03-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zizzleswomp**:	Woah, a sentence I typed disappeared: That's the whole point of the reserve pool - to make sure that there's still workers available for others later in the week if the build new buildings. So even though there's enough spare workers, you're not allowed to take them all right away.


[03-Feb-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If you want to build more buildings, the best time to do it if you've already used up your share of the worker pool is the day before the next Population report... which is about 6 1/2 days away.


[03-Feb-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	On that note, I did bump the SST up to level 2 based on this POPR. It won't be used at that level until the next report comes out, but it *is* set. 5.3% unemployment is a bit too low, IMO. Maintaining 8-12% is probably about right.


[03-Feb-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Ryst actually, it will be used at that level even though you don't upkeep it. Thanks to a bug you get some safety for free!


[03-Feb-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PhoenixCorp**:	ok thanks for explaining it.   I'll set a reminder to build the new buildings early next week

[14-Feb-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Just a tax % LR update. Reduced all PIOs by another 1 CIS (leaving Ag still higher since it benefits from the COGC program). Increased all SET by 1 CIS. That'll still be a net decrease for any HYFs because they employ more PIOs than SETs.


[14-Feb-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ryst**:	@Aufricer, we have enough of everything to last a couple weeks yet. So I don't need anything shipped just yet. I don't want to be doing everything last-minute though, so figuring out where the supplies are coming from (preferably from someone on Nemesis) is step 1.

Put up an ad for a 20-day payment (I'll fulfill right away, obviously). Use them. Re-sell them. I don't care. 750 units available at that price. (I'll check back about 6 hours after this message for any ads. Preference will be given to newer players.)

**Ryst**:	@Aufricer, correct on the shipping. And, it's fine that you aren't new. I was just going to give preference to the new folks if a bunch of people put up ads. You were the only one, so... 🤷‍♂️

**Ryst**:	Hey everyone. This is going to be my last term as governor of Gibson. Anyone and everyone should consider running. It's a reasonably simple job...


[13-Mar-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	In any case, I'll obviously be keeping the COGC and SST upkeep up-to-date throughout my term and will have materials prep'd for the next governor's term. Will also transfer the planetary tax funds over after the next election.

[25-Mar-22 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ryst**:	I'm not running for governor again (enter ADM JS-299a into a buffer window). @Aufricer is running just because no one else is but also has other responsibilities and doesn't necessarily *want* to.


[03-Apr-22 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If someone else is interested—it's a pretty simple job and you get the lovely title of "Governor at JS-299 - Nemesis (JS-299a)" in your USR <your name> buffer—put your name in the running.


[03-Apr-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Apr-22 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Apr-22 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Thx @Cnoble. The other problem is I still have an inactive player in my corp.. and


[04-Apr-22 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I have a HQ. So I would not throw the CORP away but might loose half of the income.


[04-Apr-22 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The devs said in some point of future each gov/planet will have a fixed account. But you know it took them all.ost a year for small promissed changes


[04-Apr-22 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	That said you should have now enough votes for winning.


[04-Apr-22 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**cbnoble**:	good morning/afternoon/evening everyone.  I just wanted to thank you for voting me in as governor and to let you know that it is my intention as much as possible to keep the tax collection on planet.  To facilitate this, I have posted ads on the LM for all the materials needed to fill the infrastructure upkeep and also to fund the next CoGC.  I used the current asking price on BEN as the price on each ad so that if you fill it, you don't have to give up profit.


[07-Apr-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	for the CoGC, I am planning on continuing with the Agriculture campaigns.  If you have any suggestions on things i could do better or different, let me know!

**Gravy**:	The first few weeks take the longest to get the ball rolling.  Shipping is a great money maker.  Also helps if you avoid flying too often to the CX, the longer you can wait the less cost per unit your loosing to the fuel (and flying slower helps too)


[22-Apr-22 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	You can use your own tools or one of the base planners to tweak your base.  See if the RAT recipe your using is the best.  Also you can look at if you want to haul in H2O or buy it off the CX for example

**Aufricer**:	Making DW and RAT is not wrong. When Instarted I wanted to make fuel. But there was no FF ingrediants and even SF was hard to make. I went bancrupt from flying and food. So after two weeks or so I decided Inwill make my own food to reduce costs


[22-Apr-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Thats why I am here. And it was never wrong. At that time FF was at 24 and there was no high price markwt makers.


[22-Apr-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ryst**:	FYI, there is now a COGC on KW-602c (one hop east of Etherwind) which will soon be running a Food Industries campaign (first round is always Pioneers). Milliways is still just a tad bit closer to Nemesis, for anyone who is growing crops here and producing RATs elsewhere. However, if anyone is considering settling Etherwind at some point in the future, KW-602c is a better choice than Milliways because it's directly on the way to Etherwind. In any case, consider yourselves informed, and I hope to see a few folks join me there someday.

**ThosReturns**:	Sadly I can't yet afford the construction costs of making a new base... those prices for prefabs!


[29-Apr-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	(Unless I find something amazing, it would take me about a month at my current profits to buy the parts)


[29-Apr-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@ThosReturns, that was more of a head's up for folks who have been playing awhile. 🙂 Things pick up after you build some relationships with others and put down a second base (the latter of which I wouldn't expect for at least a month anyway).


[29-Apr-22 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	2nd base was/is usually like 70 - 100 days into game. Except you do something that realy makes cash. + You could always make a BUI.PP1 yourself and do stuff yourself

**Aufricer**:	Evening, I am sending a ship towards NEM (so 20h until its here). I might have some space as I emptied the base before. If you post shipping adds towards the CX (maybe 2 x 100) I am sure someone might take them.

**cbnoble**:	Ads are posted for the needed CoGC material.  Also, please check out the Nemesis-Shipping-Trade channel if you would like to bid on supplying some, or all, of the DW for the next safety station fill!


[01-May-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Is it possible to help support those with a Trial account? I would like to support the planet since my HQ is here....


[01-May-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	are you looking to fill one of the open orders?


[01-May-22 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	those i can easily find a way


[01-May-22 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	It looks like for the basic orders I can do it from the planet screen; I have a "contribute" CMDS that will let me put in things like DW, etc. into the reserve pool, since it looks like the next upkeep tick for both CoGC and Security are fulfilled?


[01-May-22 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	For the CoGC the current upkeep has been filled and I am now looking for material to cover the next round.  If you would like, we can do a trade on the CX which would let you support and also get a return of tax monies


[01-May-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	I'm strongly considering going PRO license too - so that would make it easier.


[01-May-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	pro does make it much easier because then you can do everything on the local market


[01-May-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	and you can accept shipping contracts which can be a great source of revenue early on


[01-May-22 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ThosReturns**:	Ah never mind, I see it in the production queue screen.


[02-May-22 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	The specified COGC campaign is always active as long as its workers are not on strike (which happens if the upkeep is not fulfilled within the 10-day grace window... which should really never be a problem because we've always had good governors who've kept it topped off).

[23-May-22 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	I'll be going to Umbra afterwards, in about 4h with some space left, if anyone's interested drop me a dm


[23-May-22 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	@Mia I'll leave BEN in 2 hours towards Gibson and will tomorrow evening fly Gibson to NEM. Could take a small shipment with me if that helps


[23-May-22 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	ETA to nem?


[23-May-22 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	and how much space could you spare?


[23-May-22 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	i can spare up to 80t and ETA would be 30-40h


[23-May-22 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	how much do you want for make it 30?


[23-May-22 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dominaria**:	looking for a bulk of RAT. What is the going rate on the planet here? And does anyone have some for me? I made an ad for 500 for now @ 56/u


[23-May-22 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dominaria**:	also willing to take 1k or 2k if you can offer that price


[23-May-22 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	@Mia I don't want  a lot of money, can take it also for free with me. But I need to fly to Gibson (5h). Then need to make a short roundtrip to another planet of 15h. After that I start Gibson to NEM. The exakt ETA depends on my online time and if I always make it to send the ship directly away ;)


[23-May-22 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	If you want to send it with me, just put up an AD with 2 days delivery time ... I'll start from BEN next 30min


[23-May-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	its time sensitive for me rly


[23-May-22 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	are you still there?


[23-May-22 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	sorry, had a meeting (work from home). Still here and would start soon


[23-May-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I can offer to take something with me for free but I cannot guarantee an exact time or change flight plans. You have to decide now if you want to put up an AD or not.


[23-May-22 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For shipping from BEN -> NEM: I think most players tend to fly towards NEM empty/half empty. In generaal you might just put shipping adds and someone is likely to take them. If they are time sensitive - it of course - makes sense to announce them extra


[23-May-22 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FUSERat**:	emergency!!!  Has anyone got some water(H2O) I need in 3 hours.

**Mia_VIII**:	now its right


[23-May-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	@Fuser I can fill two of your ADs with some spare H2O


[23-May-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I added another Food Industries COGC in the region on KW-689a, which is definitely closer than Milliways. I look forward to some future company there as it's a lonely planet (just me) at the moment. Requires SEA, but that's pretty dirt cheap. Buildings also only require 1 SEA per unit of area covered by the building. Even considering extra cost for that, the fuel savings from here to there instead of from here to Milliways more than makes up for the difference.


[23-May-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	its till little out of hand


[23-May-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	still


[23-May-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	from NEM to Milli to BEN its same number of jumps as to KW


[23-May-22 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I count 3 instead of 5 jumps

***Superzack146** left.*


[23-May-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	from NEM yes


[23-May-22 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	but then you have to sell it


[23-May-22 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	If you have PRO, you can sell it on Gibson in between. In any case, that was more of an FYI for more veteran players. Things that seem way out of the realm of possibility (or cost effectiveness) when you've been playing for < 30 days become much more achievable (and cost effective) when you've been playing for > 450 days.


[23-May-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	its not ineffective... its cool that there is more planet with CoGC for Food Industry... i am just pointing out that if you are looking for CX distance its basically same


[23-May-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mia_VIII**:	and Milli is also more habitable... so my opinion is, if you wanna sell at CX then Milli is still go to planet from Nem... if you have other markets near Nem then KW is ofc much better choice


[23-May-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Another factor is transportation costs though. I'd rather transport heavy items (i.e. Ag products) a shorter distance (to KW-689a) and lighter items (i.e. RAT) a longer distance (to CX possibly) than the other way around (Ag to Milliways and RAT to CX).


[23-May-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	In any case, Milliways isn't going away. This was just a heads up that there's now another option.

[23-May-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So a Food industry Cocg caN make a lot of sense esp. if you have a lot of DW/RAT or even FERmenter production

**loupdu25**:	hey everyone, as some saw, im currently running for the governance of our great Nemesis. Here the two most important thing i have on view : first, redo the upkeep reserve which is quite low at the moment (5days). Second, ending the upgrade of the SST and building an infirmary to satisfy the need of workforce. Once this is done i will be looking to increase the warehouse level if a majority agree. (trough a vote) Thanks for your time and have a happy farming.

**ThosReturns**:	Perhaps. I would be interested in programs to build some SET and TEC infrastructure though.


[02-Jun-22 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I can see putting in a PAR for TECs if people want them. But we have over 30% unemployment of SETs at the moment. I know the happiness level will make them shrink a bit, but the happiness level should go up a bit as unemployment drops without having to build/supply an INF.

[24-Jul-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	IMO, the price of COF on the CX is too high. (Well, it's not, considering supply and demand. Stated in a better way, the universe isn't producing as much as it should be.) If I were to provide some cheap-ish NS here, would anyone (preferably newer players... but, whomever, I guess) be interested in growing CAF & producing COF? If so, send me a DM, and we can work out details.


[25-Jul-22 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Another bottleneck could be the HYF. Ihave not seem MHL or I or even CLI for normal/low prices. So a HYF is def. an investment


[25-Jul-22 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	I'd actually be interested


[25-Jul-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	need to set up some infrastructure though


[25-Jul-22 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	22H2O is quite some demand


[25-Jul-22 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	we are currently setting up a MHL base now. so we might be able to help at some point with that.


[25-Jul-22 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	so Ryst, we are also a team of three who try to slowly work for more COF availability. of course three players will not make a big dent


[25-Jul-22 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	What do you think the price "should" be? I make a reasonable amount here on Nemesis.


[25-Jul-22 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	(A reasonable amount of COF, that is).


[25-Jul-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	@Aufricer, I may try to tackle the MHL thing too... @ThosReturns, low 400s at least. Although consistently being under 500 would be a good start. Obviously, consistently cheaper NS and MHL would be requirements.


[25-Jul-22 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Maybe the price will develope towards 400 again. I recently sold 900N and 500 NS so I expect more COF produced. Big question is: How much is going tot the market


[25-Jul-22 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Currently a lot of basic materials are in demand. It seems a lot of players milking the high tier MM and dont produce stuff like RAT or Minerals/Gases anymore or only for internal purpose


[25-Jul-22 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I just sold 500+ NS too. And put another 500 on the CX at a price that I hope someone beats. More coming out of JS-570a regularly now too.


[25-Jul-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	So there are two competing forces for pricing - one is production cost, one is value gained.


[25-Jul-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	As with everything. With so many PIOs across the universe, bringing the price of COF down should have an effect on the price of a lot of other stuff too.


[25-Jul-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Sure but if it gets too low, supply goes away.  For example, I stopped producing excess DW when it's price dropped.


[25-Jul-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	I think the universe would be better served by providing things that just aren't on the CX at all...


[25-Jul-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Again, as with everything. The price of DW is still low 50s though. COF should hover in the low 400s range. Some people will get in and drop it into the 300s. Then people will get out, and it'll go back up to 415 or something. That's still better than 575.


[25-Jul-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	And still plenty of profit to be made.


[25-Jul-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
***ThosReturns** deleted this message.*


[25-Jul-22 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	You gotta have an impressively efficient setup to make money with COF in the 300s, unless you're the only supplier making it up in volume.


[25-Jul-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Stupid-efficient setup: check. Not the only product for sale: check. Plenty of profit: check. Trying to get at least a couple of others to do something similar: half-check. 🙂🤷‍♂️


[25-Jul-22 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	I guess I see it this way - I'll lower my COF prices when everyone else lowers their FE, SF, FF, etc. prices. :D


[25-Jul-22 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Otherwise I'm just leaving money on the table.


[25-Jul-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Or put another way - if you can sell all you make at price X, why sell all you can make at a lower price?


[25-Jul-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Or more specifically: It's only worth it to lower prices 10% if your total profit goes up by more than 10%.


[25-Jul-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	By lowering prices by 10%, can you sell more than 11% more per unit time? Do your input prices go down enough to end up with higher prices?


[25-Jul-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	It's about making things more affordable for newer players, so that other industries will flurish, which then again makes the products you mention cheaper because supply rises.


[25-Jul-22 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	for me as a bigger player it is not about squeezing out every bit of margin, because money is not my limiting factor, but availability of certain products


[25-Jul-22 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	and if i don't want to produce everything myself, i have to make it easier for other poeple to produce certain stuff


[25-Jul-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I'm not suggesting just lowering prices for funsies. Economies of scale makes a difference. Also, IMO, maximizing profit isn't the only thing. When you have a crap ton of cash—which I do... probably not as much as some of those folks selling high-level stuff to the MM, but enough that I don't care if I make 100, 50, or 300 CIS profit on a unit of COF—doing things other than raking in the most profit per unit sold actually becomes more fun.


[25-Jul-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	amen :-)


[25-Jul-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Likewise. :-)


[25-Jul-22 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Sure, but nothing is as simple as that.  "We're trying to help, by giving people cheap <MAT>".  All I know is, if I had started when some basic mats are as cheap as they are now, it would have taken me twice as long to build as I did.


[25-Jul-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	I would rather the well-capitalized folks provide higher supply for hard-to-get mats, not starter mats.


[25-Jul-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	but your margins would also be better because, your costs would also be lower


[25-Jul-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Still helps the universe, but doesn't penalize newcomers simply for being newcomers.


[25-Jul-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	the price of COF actually has a very big rippling effect on all Tier one mats in my opinion. so it is a good area to help newcomers


[25-Jul-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	Yeah COF I don't consider a newcomer mat.  It's just an example.


[25-Jul-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	you *really* want to help newcomers out, provide affordable shipping. Logistics sucks... :D


[25-Jul-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	This argument/discussion about profit and the current prices of items is ubiquitous in PrUn. I don't care to have it. There are too many "yeah, but..." responses to every response to ever get everyone to agree. My current goal is to make COF cheaper. Why? Because it's a goal that I think would be fun and useful.


[25-Jul-22 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	I pay premiums to ship what I don't/can't ship myself.


[25-Jul-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That's a better option, IMO, because new players who can rarely fill their cargo holds with their own stuff can now pay for gas to ship their own stuff.


[25-Jul-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	I think what got me was the comment "prices *should* be lower"... there's no "should".  There's just "what you can make work."


[25-Jul-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	It's not them paying me to ship 50 t/m3 for them.


[25-Jul-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That's why I followed it up with the supply/demand comment and saying that I think the universe "should" be *producing* more COF (which subsequently has the effect of price reduction... usually).


[25-Jul-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	i mean you have one base, how is shipping a problem for you :-D.


[25-Jul-22 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ThosReturns**:	I still need inputs and to get my outputs somewhere :D


[25-Jul-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	how much CLI are you looking to buy?  I have a base near BEN that produces some.  I can look at expanding it, if I know I have folks who will buy.  my problem right now is not having enough shipping to keep moving the product


[25-Jul-22 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	how much stuff you accumulated cbnoble ? i could plan a frew trip with my 2k ship to help a little bit.


[25-Jul-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	also i just built a brand new NS base but production is limited by population atm


[25-Jul-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	right now I'm at 456 because I moved a 2k ship worth to my Chem base for SOI.  I also ran out of rat and dw, but have a ship on the way to drop some off.  also have 650+ LST there after dropping 2k shipboard on MOR and BEN, plus a couple of my own bases

[25-Jul-22 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	CLI should be always in demand (same as BRM) for the MHL ans SOI chain. At least I went the whole chain starting from CLI for my HYFs


[25-Jul-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	But if someone would provide I a bit cheaper... i might like to safe that step. That said - the gain from CLI towards MHL is huge

**ThosReturns**:	Must be having a tech party!


[28-Jul-22 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	looks like someone has put up a tech building, which means we need to get some POPI to support.  I will get working on that.  when I can get to a real computer and my cheat sheets I'll post the direction we'll be heading


[28-Jul-22 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	ok, so after poking around on the cheat sheets and looking in depth at the POPR, we really need to be looking at adding 2 POPI buildings


[28-Jul-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	The first is going to be an infirmary to raise the health and to improve the happiness of the SET so that we don't hollow that group out as some educate up to TECs


[28-Jul-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	We also need to add a wildlife park to improve the comfort levels for the TECs so that we're not just training them to lose them.  We should not need to keep the park full on consumables


[28-Jul-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	For the infirmary, the OFF provide the best return in terms of health/CIS with TUB being a distant second.  Initially we'll work to keep those full and let the STR go.  If a week or two says we need to fill the STR, we can retrench and do so


[28-Jul-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	If I don't see any objections to this plan in the next 24 hours, I'll start working on execution, starting with the Infirmary first

**SBR404**:	Sounds good!


[29-Jul-22 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	slighty related, does anyone know where to get cheap CL from, so i can produce some cheaper EPO?


[29-Jul-22 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Produce it yourself or you can try to buy locally from people who have a surplus like on Griffonstone. Smaller amount on LM are sold for around 1600/u there


[29-Jul-22 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	Griffonstone, thx for the pointer

[29-Jul-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	I have the bfabs for the wildlife park that i'll be moving up, plus tru for the infimary and a lot of 600 off and 300 tub to start it off.  i am working on producing the necessary soi (and contracting for the hab) for the wildlife park

**ThosReturns**:	@cbnoble by the way, I have on my list of things to do, to set up a base with CLI which could be part of a SOI chain. Nothing "soon" but it's on my radar.

**cbnoble**:	infirmary is now built and supplied with OFF and TUB.  Thank you to xensored for the donation of the Bfabs!


[31-Jul-22 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cbnoble**:	The wildlife park is next.  I have the bfabs for the park, including the HABs.  I am making the SOI and xensored will be manufacturing the HABs once i provide the materials.  HABs are slow, mutliday builds, so we are likely looking at a little more than 2 weeks before the park is complete


[31-Jul-22 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Good job. I had checked if I cn do the HAB but I could not find the SOI and so decided to scrap that building.


[31-Jul-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The park itself can be run with a minimal input. I remember there was one on LG-418b, that is not fully supplied but it works for the (few) technicians at that time


[31-Jul-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Unfortunately I have 3 other things in my UPF queue before (CQM -- nearly finished + BR1 + BRS). But already added the 5 HABs to the queue. 12,5d from now

[04-Aug-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	Now with the new custom contracts we could actually do some kind of Nemesis lottery :D


[04-Aug-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Lottery how ? Isnt it repeating contract in the end ?


[04-Aug-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	If I understand it correctly, you can now set a specific user as a recipient for a contract


[04-Aug-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	so you could do like a „lottery“ here in the chat – like everyone posts their a number from x to y, and whoever is closest to a random number wins the contract


[04-Aug-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	*randomly generated number, I should say


[04-Aug-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FInglan**:	But the person who wins the lottery has to have an pro or Basis license.


[04-Aug-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**loupdu25**:	and you could do it by asking the winner to post a buy ad


[04-Aug-22 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	if you post an ad on the LM he woud need Pro or basic as well to pick up the ad so i think thats a bad point


[04-Aug-22 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SBR404**:	The recipient of a custom contract doesn’t need a pro/basic account, do they?


[04-Aug-22 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	it dose


[04-Aug-22 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ihelp**:	becase then why woud you get pro if you can trade over private contracts you woudn´t need the LM/Pro any more

[07-Oct-22 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	define water


[07-Oct-22 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	"could be better"


[07-Oct-22 04:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-22 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HogginDoss**:	Mainly wondering how space efficient it will be to stack enough rigs to run orchards in the future for example


[07-Oct-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	hwo much water does that use


[07-Oct-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	you need 120 space for each orchard and 10 for each rig the rigs here get around 1 unit pr hour of h2o


[07-Oct-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	you can have max 1000 space with 2 permits of base?


[07-Oct-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	I mean 750 its 750 with 2 permits, though up to 3 goes with better, upgfraded version?


[07-Oct-22 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ChrisCorgi**:	I'd guess there is a n missing for *new base


[07-Oct-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	EW likely means eitherwind (KW-688c) a planet with a high H2O concentration


[07-Oct-22 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pounder**:	rig is the building which collects liquids which is what get H2O on both Nemesis and EW (where H2O is liquid)


[07-Oct-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	yes

[07-Oct-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aufricer**:	To fill the population infrastructure and esp. the Chamber of global commerce I added some buys to the local market (CX prices). Try to fill them esp. the MCG that I dont have available. It will take a while to ship everything in and better we dont have a strike or POPI out of material. Also I will try to do small buys, so even new capitalists should be able to fill them.

**Aufricer**:	Safety station and Infirmery have reserves for 20 days. I bought materials to cover the next 30 days or so. Also I will have a close look to the satisfactions of workforce tiers. I might only feed one or two needs per infrastructure type. For COCG I will post buy adds for DW and RAT. PE and MCG is covered and have been/will be contributed before the next cycle is due. I would like to give a bit input to the Wildlife park. All new players are encouraged to produce FOD for it. One of you already took an add -thats fine. You may also PM me and I can send individual contracts. I somehow missed, that you need to change the collecting entity for taxes. Thus 2 days are lost. I (try) to keep track of tax inflow and the costs. As there is cash reserves you wont need to expect a change in taxation during that election cycle.

**Aufricer**:	I can recheck the price for FOD. But I did that buys a few days ago and had a quick look to the CXs


[24-Oct-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Yeah, the F was to have a visible different add. Should a new player not have a rating after 2 weeks or so. Next LM adds I can do with normal P rating. Or as I said I may send direct contracts


[24-Oct-22 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And yes - the price seems to be a bit low... Not sure maybe I doubled from 16 to 32 without adjusting price or did a mistake somewhere else. Anyhow - thanks for the hint.


[24-Oct-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For the wildlife park: I may wait for the next POPI update. Seems we still have unemployed Technicians. + The animals in zoo got some food - so lets see how that turns out. All the other stuff should be covered by now/for a while.


[24-Oct-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Felmer**:	I think typical target is ~20% unemployment. So looks good. Maybe get some more PIO. Looks like activating 3rd SST might be enough to get growth


[24-Oct-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	What do others think ? Do we need more PIO ? let me/us know.


[25-Oct-22 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	Hi and yes i think 5% is quite low in reserves. 20% sounds good, Something between 10% to 15% seems good for me if it can payed with tax income.

**q333**:	yea


[19-Jan-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**electron**:	the approximate ROI in days for what you can sell O for is between 30-37 days, and SCR is between 40-50 days. SCR doesn't have much demand, however it is bought by the Market Maker


[19-Jan-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm extracting SCR... but that's just because I use quite a bit of it


[19-Jan-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**electron**:	yeah, there doesn't seem to be a reliable supply to not be vertically integrated as such


[19-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**electron**:	due to the water kings shenanigans, a rig could probably return your investment in about 2-3 weeks


[19-Jan-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	collecting Oxygen is fine here... but O is typically pounded hard


[19-Jan-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**electron**:	I seem to have mixed the ROI between O and SCR, fyi. Also, once water restabilizes it's returns will be similar to O


[20-Jan-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**IcarusNatusPugnam**:	The Gravy Company	300	250.00 CIS Int'l Import-Export Trading Co	1,000	116.00 CIS when someone really whantys something OO


[20-Jan-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will buy a O from time to time


[20-Jan-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also I had SCR extraction going on on Nem for a long long long time.


[20-Jan-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	It was a way to stabilize income in a world without Fuel production (yes even before they added Mat.TS around Antares)


[20-Jan-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	But the intention was to produce S on mass... There was a market maker for that but like 20h before production started they removed it. Many NEM companies got p*ssed

**Aufricer**:	Hi fellow NEMesianians. I struggled a bit but adjusted the taxation of Nemesis first time since a year or so.


[12-Feb-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	1 COCG upkeep cycle currently cost about 60k. And I have spend allmost 294k for the POPI upkeep.


[12-Feb-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	We will probably need to feed the safety infrastructure even more. And maybe also give water for animals in zoo.


[12-Feb-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	since early November 2022 a deficit of about 698k occured between tax and upkeep (some 100k was for the emergency center).


[12-Feb-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Anyhow: last cycle costs of 400k stands vs. 350k tax (we had like 85k per week). So I took a look to other planets and adjusted our tax to support agriculture. I also decreased tax for ressource extraction to the minimum.


[12-Feb-23 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I like to see H2O (DW) production also Carbon farming. Also all industries that somehow support farming  (chemistry with NS production) and LAB with DDT production is taxed a bit below.


[12-Feb-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Taxation focus is on Farming and related stuff. Other industries got punished a bit. Also total tax had been increased everywhere. I expect to see final tax results in 2 or 3 weeks. Basing on them I may lower tax (farming taxes) a bit again. Meanwhile I will feed more DW to our POPI

[13-Feb-23 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-23 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But eventually, there will be enough open jobs to counteract that and there will be an equilibrium


[13-Feb-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I have seen OFF recently. As soon as POPI stock is depleated, I would probably rebuy it


[20-Feb-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	While being on track(s) to work I worked on tax. Despite the recent tax ratex increase


[20-Feb-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The tax itself remained stable. 86k CIS this week.


[20-Feb-23 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So either majority of Buisness on NEM is ressource extraction or a lot of companies have long lasting production queues with the old tax rate locked in


[20-Feb-23 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Still no problem. POPI upkeep and COCG upkeep is (thx for the contracts etc ) is secured or will be secured for the foreseenable future

[27-Feb-23 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Any idea why the happiness of settlers on NEM is so low (compared with Techs and pios)


[28-Feb-23 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Would it make sense to save on POPI input and insteadt run a festival program?


[28-Feb-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Currently I feel like feeding less for POPI (maybe cut the wildlife park) would help reduce the allmost 100k deficit on spending vs tax


[28-Feb-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So I never dived deeper in the mechanics(and dont realy want to) -> open for all inputs


[28-Feb-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	There is a ton of unemployment, 40% on settlers. So happiness is heavily penalized. This isn't a bad thing. That's a lot of unemployed settlers and we don't need them all so it's fine if they leave. Don't try to fight the unemployment, it will win


[28-Feb-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I think if you keep things as they are you'll be at full employment next report. Pioneers will still migrate in and hopefully settlers will leave. That should leave you a healthy margin in all the categories.


[28-Feb-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You could probably cut the PAR without any downsides, although I haven't run the numbers


[28-Feb-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Running the numbers, it looks like cutting the PAR would result in 0.8% less unemployment of pioneers in 3 weeks. From 6.8% to 7.4%. So it's safe to say cutting the PAR will be fine.


[28-Feb-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You could also cut POW from the EMC without any cost


[28-Feb-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Aufricer**:	tax income on other side was 354550


[06-Mar-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	A deficit of round about 157k CIS


[06-Mar-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Tax changes had no effect until I had adjusted tax for ressource extraction. Now each week tax inflos is  95k


[06-Mar-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	enough for the COCG but this cycle I will save on POPI. Piboy provided some assistance so we will see how to balance tax and popi and try to prevent a crash of popi numbers

[31-Mar-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xensored**:	ok great


[31-Mar-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I'll build a PHF on Umbra next days, can make you some BSC for the emergency center then. But will take a week or so


[31-Mar-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Ah, that was a real huge donation and should cover like 50 to 80 % of what NEM POPI needs for upkeep in 4 weeks.


[31-Mar-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	np, I don't produce POPI stuff but have some suppliers for some things I need sometimes. So I can spare some of my stockpile


[31-Mar-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will probably produce some bandages sooner or later. But for now I have to transport the stuff to NEM.


[31-Mar-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The aim is to keep taxes for everyone stable, while also provide for the population (and dont always go into minus)


[31-Mar-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	shouldn't be any problem, I produce all the inputs for BSC but never built a PHF. But I need ADR regularly and though about to produce them myself instead of buying them on CX. Now I can free some area on Umbra and will built a PHF. I'll send you some BSC next week

**Aufricer**:	Hi everyone. Is there realy a problem with settlers ? If someone needs them, they will probably appear with the next update cycle


[07-Apr-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also thank you @Drmambo for donating to POPI as well.


[07-Apr-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	From recent donation there is a left over of: 1600 OFF and 2685 DW and 170 TUB. Additional stretchers and TUB is already here.


[07-Apr-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Last 4 weeks the tax deficit was only (ca) 2.000 CIS


[07-Apr-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For the following 4 weeks thanks to the donations I expect tax > costs

**Hydralisk**:	Is there any reason why there arent any pioneers? It doesnt move from 201


[12-Apr-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You either don't need more than 200, so you only get 200 (not a bad thing), or you only have space for 200, having built your initial 2 HB1, indicating you should build more HB1.


[12-Apr-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	What buildings do you have?


[12-Apr-23 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaler**:	We all need to wait for the next popi cycle, 0 unemployed workers (POPR JS-299A)


[13-Apr-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydralisk**:	Ohh I see. Was just curious


[13-Apr-23 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydralisk**:	I have capacity for 300, required 240 and current workforce 201 (1)


[13-Apr-23 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hydralisk**:	But I guess its because of what you said about population right?


[13-Apr-23 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	ive done a few POPI upgrades, we've now got 5 SS and 5 INF


[13-Apr-23 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrMambo**:	that should sort us for a bit


[13-Apr-23 03:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	what are you worried about?


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Im still learning the game so I am just waiting for something I dont know to bite me in the butt lmao


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im just making rations waiting for my food empire to fall apart any day now


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you honestly should be fine...


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	maybe im just over thinking it


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Just farm and make consumables...


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	stockpile enough goods for 5 days and send a ship every 5ish days


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhh ok


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was just thiking I sent my ship to early


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fly your ship responsibly... usually minium fuel/recator with maybe a notch or two up from that


[15-Apr-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohhh ok, yep there was my mistake I was talking about


[15-Apr-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fuel around Benten is cheap... so it's not going to hurt much


[15-Apr-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	look into grabbing some PWOs to speed your production along


[15-Apr-23 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok


[15-Apr-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	erm whats a pwo?

**plokgi**:	Padded Work Overalls, increase prod speed


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they'll have your pioneers work ~8 to 9% faster


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhhhhhh ok I was thinking about looking for tasers for the same effect


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**plokgi**:	as does COF


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	COF is a bit expensive atm


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can consider making COF yourself with a HYF building


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	also how did you know I was around brenten?


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**plokgi**:	after a while


[15-Apr-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you are talking on nemesis chat


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there isn't any combat in PRUN


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was kidding :)


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**plokgi**:	we cant take from each other, not that type of game


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I figured as much cause I looked for fighting stuff as soon as I started


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**plokgi**:	best to work together to improve profit for all


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	cause I was worried if I needed to build defenses


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	It's honestly in everyone's best interest for there not to be combat


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I totally agree


[15-Apr-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	could you imagine trying to a humble cabbage farmer with some dude running around with a fleet of mother ships like this was a 4x game.... yikes


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah.. there are corps with that out there


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	cabbage farmers?


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	both xD


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	wait therea re motherships in this game?


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what do they do?


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	largest ships out there


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**plokgi**:	15 years waisted on that garbage


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	haha i played eve online for a long time as well


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	at least PRUN lets me get work done


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	this game would be like "hey got my cabbage farm hotdroped again awesome"


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	while still playing


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	it seems kind of "slow" but that might just be the case cause im just getting started and dont know all the stuff yet


[15-Apr-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plus, it makes for a friendly community


[15-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**plokgi**:	yah, i dont work at a desk but I like to know when to loggin to the mobile version, it's iffy but not too bad


[15-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	start is slow... but once you're on 2 bases.... things get crazy


[15-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I govern JS-601c... it's a good place if you want HAL + FEO around Benten


[15-Apr-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	This is a good map for reference: http://prosperous.freecluster.eu/?i=1


[15-Apr-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	does anyone else constantly get the weird feeling they are doing everyything wrong and any moment they are gonna discover some horrible pitfall in their planning and be doomed forever?


[15-Apr-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	sweet


[15-Apr-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohhhhhhh


[15-Apr-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and I can click on your name and see where your bases are


[15-Apr-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**plokgi**:	nah, I'd be so out, I like my space trucking and spreadsheets just fine without Eve Online again tyvm


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just ships with 2k/2k cargo capacity


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yep


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you're new... ask a lot of questions


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I saw you govern it


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it can only help you


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	right


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok does the game ever get to a point where you are trying to compete with other players over your market or is everything super pacted up?


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it certainly can


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	or inversely to that is the game ever hard enough because of design to risk "struggling"


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and inversly to that "where is the conflict" of course not in combat but... like do we have any sort of enemies can enemies be a thing?


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	combat is all economic/markets


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	of course


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok so there is still some conflict there then and its not all just everyone in the entire game agrees


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	"struggle" can occur... but the margins players are willing to play for stuff is not tight


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I mean I think that is some what good


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is because logistics plays a large part.. and regions are different


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	goods can only make it to market so fast


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and markets are either local or regional... so transport is a largepart of the game


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well crap now I have to get my daddy warbucks hat on


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Even is someone made a deathstar that spout thousands of RATs per day...


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they would have the headach of takign all those to market still


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well I intentionally choice a high consumption or at least what I thought was one starting job for that reason


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	agriculture is a good starting industry


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was worried with things that might not be in demand as much like say building parts or metal that I might be easily snuffed out by highe rproduction power.


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it can lead into may other opportunities


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok next question.. how does one go about getting on 2 bases... I havent fully explored everything but I assume there is something I need to build/buy/produce


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah.. the larger players do their own things


[15-Apr-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	good question...


[15-Apr-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it helps to know the region you started in


[15-Apr-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so get to know the CX and planets around benten... the named ones in particular


[15-Apr-23 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it takes a while to learn.. plus Nemesis is a bit away from the CX


[15-Apr-23 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not much of an issue though... you'll make plenty of profit


[15-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohhh you mean I just have to make jobs for them and they show up?


[15-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	once you do so... more pioneers will be allocated from the plant's population (if available)


[15-Apr-23 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Habs are important as well


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	right to keep them more happy and less space


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	pop on starter planets usually isn;t an issue


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	on more exotic planets, gettign enough pop can take a moment


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see that


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is basically what the governors do


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they manage the planet's pop. and growth


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhhh kewl kewl


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so you are the person I bribe for more peoples


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sure can.. but I'd likely get you enough pop for free


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lololol


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	talking with your governot can go a long way


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	you said give you and free in the same sentence :P


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	my planet is small


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	once I get the hang of the game get my spreadsheet empire together


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I want to attract more players to it


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ill be able to make more informed choices


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well if you have room for a humble ration farmer I might put my second base there to help you out


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	given timers on stuff tho I think it will be a couple days at least before im ready


[15-Apr-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	JS-601c does metallurgy, chemistry, or construction well


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just depends what you are looking to do


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Im really thinking imma stick in the food path


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	then I would suggest proxion


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok do you know what kind of wine the proxion governer likes?


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plenty of pops on proxion xD


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	question tho.... is a lot of people in the food game?


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	like am I making the typical choice by sticking with food? I feel like others go into more interesting stuff


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	every player needs consumables.... how they get them is their business


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lolol


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	everyone has a damn ration base I bet


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	food is a popular industry.. but plenty of market to go around


[15-Apr-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope.. not everyone


[15-Apr-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I expect many ofthe larger players just buy RATs


[15-Apr-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	id imagine there would become a point where building rations for your work force wouldnt be worht as much as buying your rations and using that space to build up your main stuff better


[15-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plus.. new players that started in other industries wouldn't be able to produce their own RATs


[15-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohh trueeee


[15-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	jus like you cannot produce construction goods


[15-Apr-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	good point


[15-Apr-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	unlike Nemesis.. Proxion doesn;t have a decent H2O deposit


[15-Apr-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see why having only 2 ships now is a free thing cause having more is most def an advantage


[15-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so if you go to proxion.. you'll likely want to export H2O from Nemesis there


[15-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was thinknig that

**RNGzero**:	not really


[15-Apr-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the most useful windows are CXOS, FINLA, FLT,


[15-Apr-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	some how I felt like I would have ran into that alrready


[15-Apr-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	mine was shown in the forum thread


[15-Apr-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I know this sounds weird but all my rl trianing tells me to seperate the screens like "company divisions"


[15-Apr-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and then like a main overview screen


[15-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	if I buy things on this planet I dont have to use a ship?


[15-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but that requires at least basic (expired PRO)


[15-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhh but local market is slim ok


[15-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ill most likely get pro once I get the hang of the game


[15-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	consider it in 1-2 months  (at least once)


[15-Apr-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	even without it... there is tons of opportunity to do cool things


[15-Apr-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well to be honest the cost is cheap, it doenst concern me its like the price of a coffee... ok ill just buy one less coffee... I just want to make sure I stick with it, like how I wouldnt buy a coffee I wouldnt drink


[15-Apr-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	as for expanding you base... depends what buildings/products you'll get into


[15-Apr-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	don;t upgrade your HQ untill you're on a second base

**q333**:	i couldn't wait lol


[15-Apr-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'll want to use a majority of your 500 area base on Nemesis


[15-Apr-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	as establishing a 2nd base takes some investment


[15-Apr-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	you should build out more first


[15-Apr-23 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	I wouldn't recommend extracting SCR on Nemesis...


[15-Apr-23 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	on the empire overview screen make sure PRUNer is pulling from the right CX

**RNGzero**:	Benten CX is CI1


[15-Apr-23 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Eraser**:	next question can I set PRUNer to a weekly overview instead of daily?


[15-Apr-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	250 area per extra permit (max 1k size)... or 500area for a new base


[15-Apr-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope... but just add a 0 to each number... and that gets you 10 days worth of stuff


[15-Apr-23 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	let me know if anythign else comes up!


[15-Apr-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I think I have enough of a grasp now to start building and working on it


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im gonna need to go through the map and get familiar with all the places


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice thank you


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	does this game have a stock market outside of just the commodities and stuff?


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hmm... there is a Finance exchange between currencies... but that isn;t used much


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are various ways to play...


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I see that :)


[15-Apr-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	how do I see the finance exchange?


[15-Apr-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhhhhh ok


[15-Apr-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	value of currencies don't change that much


[15-Apr-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so its not really a market as much as its just to make sure you can get the currencies you need to play the game


[15-Apr-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah... more of a quick... I need XYZ currency... trade me ZYX


[15-Apr-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	if that had charts and I could start speculating on prices and "investing" I would ge tpro instantly for just hat.


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah... you can already do short selling of the CXs


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I would not recommend flipping items on the same CX tho


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	like a company, a currency, or even a crypto.. these arent really things you "hold" persay


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I understand how to physical item trading, I was just hoping for a finances side its kewl tho


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah... not much on that side


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats ok, it would be kewl tho if like I could put my company up with stocks and get investors and shiz


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some players kinda do that with loans to other players


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	its a bit different that way tho but I could see how players would do that


[15-Apr-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you have a plan.. someone may finance it... just have to ask around on the discord


[15-Apr-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	no I get that thanks


[15-Apr-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm an independent player... I find it more fun than rolling with a corp.


[15-Apr-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	even a corp wouldnt fufill the game feature I am describing but yes I can understand that.


[15-Apr-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I just needed a corp shell to be governor of JS-601c xD


[15-Apr-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lolol


[15-Apr-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I wonder why they bother putting the corp requirement up if people just shell it


[15-Apr-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but even right now, the game is quite a fun sandbox


[15-Apr-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	do I care about the orbital stuff it shows on that map is that for show?


[15-Apr-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes... orbits matter for STL travel


[15-Apr-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhh ok


[15-Apr-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can make the differnece between 8h trip and an 2 day trip


[15-Apr-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok so thats why the map shows it


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	?


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	design ships and test them out


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FYI, cheapest ship is ~600k and that doesn;t have an FTL engine


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	no problem, but laying out your options


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	no no no dont take it the wrong way tahnk you very much


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	all good xD


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but the test thing is good looking out


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	those starter ships are your largest asset


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah like 1.2 mill


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but I cant loose them can I like noone will blow them up?>


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	try ~2.5 - 3m each


[15-Apr-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh wow


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just don't get them ctuck somewhere w/o enough fuel


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you don't want to call for a tow truck


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh yeah goo dpoint on that but luckily I think I will be ok for my little puddle jumps


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I assume you cant sell them to buy something cheaper right?


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it took a long time before ship makers were a thing


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	universe had to become sufficiently advanced for that


[15-Apr-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lol I see


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it takes scientist populations for many ship parts


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and you can sell other ships just not the starter ones?


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	how do you call for a tow ask a dev or is there a game mechanic?


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and that takes a lot of buildup


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this universe is over 700 days old now


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh does the game reset often?


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ah, 781 days into this universe


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this is the longest a universe has gone on


[15-Apr-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is the game resetting because of beta or just out of design?


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and the devs have not layed any plans out for a wipe anytime soon


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok im asking why they are wiping


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is the game intended to wipe as its nature


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	eventually their plan seems to be a universe w/o wipes


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	or is it because of testing/dev stuff?


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	wipes only happen when a feature is add that requires it


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok well I think it would be best for me to come back when its closer to that time, I sadly do not play games that wipe.


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	these are not common events


[15-Apr-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	after alpha and beta of albion I vowed to never ever never play a game that wipes again


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	It to me is a complete waste of time to play them, and most def a waste of money to invest in them.


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	wipes do not happen each update


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I feel like I wasted like 2 years on that game for nothing


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	albion was a lot of fun xD


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I guess


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	difficult to find an economy within agame that doesn't get destroyed by a glitch or bug


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I just want to make sure the devs arent just deving to reset us


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and if 700 days ( I assume RL days) with out a wipe has gone then thats pretty ok


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but they are a small team that actually does care


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I mean even if they wiped me after 2 years id be fine with that even


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	awesome


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they even play their own game xD


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I want to play this game so imma give it a chance under the assumption that it doesnt just wope because the devs are to lazy to write converters


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	$molp

**Eraser**:	yeah I get that


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but devs these days seem to be like "WE ADDED NEW GRASSSS WIPEEEE"


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	a new universe is a HUGE deal


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah thats fine with me then


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when it happens.. people get excited


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since that means a new layout... resource distribution... everything


[15-Apr-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it's not just the same map


[15-Apr-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Eraser**:	that is fine with me


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but only when a feature large enough requires it


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I just dont want to be wiped every 3 months cause of a new patch


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	like ship building is understandable cause that changes the entire game and some people might ahve wanted a different start if it was there when they started


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	on their website as well


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and honestly I can deal with a wipe every couple years I mean thats nothing...


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	or even every 9 months


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this is a chill small community in a nich game


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I can deal with wipes as long as I feel like the company is doing it as a last resort cause the new game needs it or community needs it


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	We cover a fair bit and I hope that helps


[15-Apr-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Eraser**:	lol


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ALO got expensive.. like 300/u


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh im not worried about others in the rat game... its like sliining burgers


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	its "not that hard"


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	on Deimos you can mine soo much of that per day


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	oh yeah...


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the Benten region doesn;t have a decent ALO deposit.... (aside from using HSE +INS for it)


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	also given that there is a lot of ways to make rats I would assume alot of different ways to do it and make money


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	*looks up alo*


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for harsher planets... extra materials such as INS, HSE, etc... are need to build stuff


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but thats more for like mining and stuff I would assume that there are a lot of farmers on harsh planets lol


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so a base somewhere harsh needs to be worth the extra expense


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not really... fertile planets are relitively uncommon


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I assume for like mining and stuff is what makes it worth it


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ill have to look for a good fertile planet


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fertile planets are not harsh either


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I figured not


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is why HYFs exist


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they can be made on non-fertile planets


[15-Apr-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or even gas giants...


[15-Apr-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plus.. HQ upgrades can get expensive


[15-Apr-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	sorry not ignoring what you saiyn gjust doing maths


[15-Apr-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	what is sliining?


[15-Apr-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	if you are talking about something I said it was most likely a typo


[15-Apr-23 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	any tips on fertile planets?


[15-Apr-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh wait you gave me a good website already and you told me that fertile planet space is basically gone


[15-Apr-23 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	which means humble cabbage farmer might not be the way to go in the "long run"


[15-Apr-23 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	You know I think you have given me a lot of really good tips passively


[15-Apr-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just depends how developed they are in other industries


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for larger players... the few agriculture planets they have may not provide enough


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	also I assume N is gotten by collectors on gas planets?


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not all the time


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	take a look at NE


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I did


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	And what did you say your planet is good for?


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	which one xD


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I have quite a few


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	the one you governerere


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	It provides HAL and FEO


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you want HAL + LST try JS-570a


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but Proxion is likely what you'd want for LST around Benten


[15-Apr-23 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so question is there a way for me to put a buy order in to have something delievered to me?


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'd buy the stuff per normal... than make a shipping contract to where you'd want the stuff delivered


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	remind me to go back in time and make a friend who can give me one of thos enifty trial keys lol


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok but the game does support it, so tahts good to know


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	trial keys do not provide basic after the fact


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah most likely ill just upgrade myself


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	awesome


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	with basic (expired pro).. you can only accpet contracts


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	local market is exactly what is says


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	the website acts like they are different my bad


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	local markets do works a bit differently


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I assume only people locally can see them?


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	check out the one in proxion


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup, the entire contract


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok I get that


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they do that


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	quite often players with gas giant bases will contract shipping out to those


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	gas giants.... can be very very productive


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I was just thinking that


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	which cna be both good and bad... depends on your perspective


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	anyone can see what we say in this chat if they know where to look but only the people on this planet can chat here


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Tho right now I think I need to get my funds up before I try anything to crazy


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	large deposites are nice... but you could be stuck holding the bag transporting heavy stuff to the CX


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats what I mean about getting my funds up before I try any risky stuff


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and that can be a lot of tips frequently


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I just have 1 EXT on proxion


[15-Apr-23 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	than ship the rest


[15-Apr-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah thats smart


[15-Apr-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is a base forever or can it be dismatled and moved?


[15-Apr-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'll describe it a bit better


[15-Apr-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and do I have to "buy the land" or anything like that?


[15-Apr-23 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok


[15-Apr-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	to remove a core... you'd need to demo all the buildings than you can demo core


[15-Apr-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'll get some of the materials back... depends on how long those buildings and core were therer


[15-Apr-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[15-Apr-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	at 90 days you can basically pull up a base and retain 1/2 the building supplies


[15-Apr-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh i see


[15-Apr-23 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	technically 89 days... on 90 is a breakpoint


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	tyou can do that was well... but you'll only get 100% returned for stuff built within an hour


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so after 1 hour to 89 days you get 50% back


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	anythign after that buildings stuff gets degraded (always fron loaded)


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so its a scal between 1 hour to 90 days


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	scale


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	50% at day 89... each building's materials degrade at different rates


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah i get it now


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so it can be tougher to determine how much


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	right right but I get it now


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or 59 days.... depends who you ask


[15-Apr-23 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so you can build a quick stockpile... take off the building/base... and coast for a while on it


[15-Apr-23 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	now... some planets are full... without any available plots


[15-Apr-23 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	those tend to be starter planets


[15-Apr-23 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plots*


[15-Apr-23 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats people who started there but there wasnt techincally room for them


[15-Apr-23 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	typically you get a negative for being on planets or place sover populated


[15-Apr-23 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so I was worried there was some overcrowded disadvantage I didnt want to mess with


[15-Apr-23 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oof


[15-Apr-23 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	does the gove get any like taxes or benifits


[15-Apr-23 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup... governing a starter planet... or other large planet.... can be a huge undertaking


[15-Apr-23 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	also does work force show up over time like experts?


[15-Apr-23 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	production taxes of the planet go to the governor... and they set the taxes


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Yeah I got that


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	before being allocated to players they go into the pool to be employed


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players can only employ so many within the pool each week


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and the governer dishes them out to the players?


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so if there are not enough pops. to go around.. some jobs re not filled


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so what does the governer do about this?


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is why governors try to have 10-20% extra unemployed pops.


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	how does the govener make pop?


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	to cover any deficits or new bases startng up


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the governor...typically... supplies the population infrastructure (POPI) that covers the needs of the pops.


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	materials are consumbed by the  POPI to maintain or grow pops.


[15-Apr-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	governors can also set projects... such as immigration or education


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	additional POPI buildings can be built and upgraded as well to take care of more needs


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	a governor manages all of that


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hopefully the planet's texes cover it


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhh ok


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and what does it take to become a governer? besides you know being rich


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	being voted into office by players on that planet


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh and if no or low players on that planet is it "easy"?


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players in corps... tend to have an advantage xD


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	there seems to be a lot of planet space compared to players


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but maybe I am wrong


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not every planet is desirable...


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I guess thats true


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not really.. some planets just don;t need a governor


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they are too small or don;t have large pop. needs


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	planets need an administative center to actually vote for a governor


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup


[15-Apr-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so thats what I was wondering if the governer system can grow as the players grow in a non reset enviroment


[15-Apr-23 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	currently... there are only soo many "larger" projects in the game for player to work toward


[15-Apr-23 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[15-Apr-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well I mean the map seems big enough that if need arose cause of player base governers could happen as the game grew


[15-Apr-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and would be a while before the players decided to move into the less desirable planets


[15-Apr-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	kind of liek the fertile planets thing


[15-Apr-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some systems are just not worth investing into


[15-Apr-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it takes a lot of resources to "ignite" a planet


[15-Apr-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	wellll if you wanted to play that part of the game and you had no other opition because its been out for 5 years on release


[15-Apr-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what is "worth investing in" becomes much different in a game setting


[15-Apr-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	exactly... it depends on the goals of a player


[15-Apr-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[15-Apr-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but I could see now in a smaller time frame with wipe potential and a small player base why something isnt at all worth it


[15-Apr-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	governors are an essential part.. but they can also be a determent if someone unprepared was elected


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I get that too


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that occationall occurs


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well it occurs a lot in real life ;)


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	because like you said often the infuence of a "corp" gets you there


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	running a planet takes a lot.. I've found it fun


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but someone else may not


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	haha yeag


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I could see where the bad ones might yoink that


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for the larger planets... that sum can be substantial


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	on JS-601c... with the few bases/players there that adds up to ~30k week


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is that a lot? I figured that wasnt very much


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just enough to cover the POPI expenses


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh wait


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	cause its few yeah


[15-Apr-23 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I would come help you out man but I dont even know the production chains of what you are doing


[15-Apr-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you look at a Katoa or Umbra...we're talking millions each week


[15-Apr-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhhh ok


[15-Apr-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah, no pressure. Only if it makes sence to do so


[15-Apr-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what end products are made with the stuff there>


[15-Apr-23 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	HSEs to build on it are not exactly cheap


[15-Apr-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	let me do some looking what did you say was good there?


[15-Apr-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	HAL and FEO


[15-Apr-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	whats the logicsital set up over there like? Like you said before am I gonna get stuck holding the stuff I mine there with no way to get it off planet?


[15-Apr-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	HAL is mainly for chemistry for DDT-> HER or EPO.... while FEO for pre-fabs and other goods


[15-Apr-23 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	like walk me through a bit of it


[15-Apr-23 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	(gold miners dont give two fs about what people do with the gold they mine it and sell it, and I will most likely think about it like that)


[15-Apr-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I am more interested in 2 primary things. Is the raw materials profitable to mine and sell, with little to no need for off planet refinement, and is the logicistal support for a newer player like me there to get it to the market it will sell at, or is the local market buying it regularly>


[15-Apr-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	herbs are used for consumables such a MED, FIM, KOM... while EPO is used for R-fabs


[15-Apr-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the issue with the extraction.. is unrefined items tend to be bulky and not ship well


[15-Apr-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	hmmm ill do some calcs


[15-Apr-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	refining them up 1 stage tend to get a better transport ratio


[15-Apr-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	sure sure, but tell me the planet anyway


[15-Apr-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	JS-601c


[15-Apr-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	PLI

**Eraser**:	whats the building that refines?


[15-Apr-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	the other one cause more hal


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	JS-601c provides slightly more HAL and FEO... but only requires MCG


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	err... Kiruna doesn;t require HSEs


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah but their governer hasnt sat with me for 2+ hours and answered all my instant questions


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Kiruna is cheaper to build on...because it's pressure isn't red


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	sooo their governer can eat yellow snow


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	we could have done this in help chat xD


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I think I can make this work


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Whats the good market close by?


[15-Apr-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RNGzero**:	everyone here passes through the JS-601 system already


[15-Apr-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	this is way better!


[15-Apr-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	tell me that once you look at the HSE price HSE.CI1


[15-Apr-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'd need 1 per building


[15-Apr-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	at least you don;t need to repair habs or cores


[15-Apr-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I dont know what that means


[15-Apr-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it's another CX but on the outter rim

[15-Apr-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	HER.CI1


[15-Apr-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh


[15-Apr-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	do people want their KOM.CI1 that bad?


[15-Apr-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	1 CL makes 3 DDT.. each DDT makes 4 HER


[15-Apr-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohhhhh right


[15-Apr-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im putting the pieces together

**RNGzero**:	depends... some make MED.CI1 or FIM.CI1


[15-Apr-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was just making a Kombucha joke


[15-Apr-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	KOM already has a king... xD


[15-Apr-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lololol


[15-Apr-23 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	no seriously... The Gravy Company makes thousands of KOM to sell xD


[15-Apr-23 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can see their listing on KOM.NC1


[15-Apr-23 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	JS-601c just has a lot of uses.. but its not for everyone


[15-Apr-23 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	depends on what products intrest you


[15-Apr-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well.. at least youcould setup PP1s there as well and make your own pre-fabs


[15-Apr-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lol


[15-Apr-23 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	as you mentioned before it will primarly be cost that will hold me back for the moment


[15-Apr-23 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	daddy warbux over there


[15-Apr-23 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup, so just consider it later


[15-Apr-23 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh i saved it ;)


[15-Apr-23 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'd still suggest Proxion


[15-Apr-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you want more agriculture with some LST


[15-Apr-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	naaa


[15-Apr-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	that was before I started looking into this planet you govern


[15-Apr-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I can make this work better then that other plan


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so again I need to do transport costs anaylist but so far it seems shifting the food and water to the mining planet


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FPs make a lot of RATs/DW per day


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	FP?


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FP = food processor...depends which products you want to make your money from xD


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and if its 1 jump from the main hub, at my level im not at any risk of out mining my two ships, so if costs of fuel arent stupid nuts I should be fine at least at my level


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohh right duh fp


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I knew that


[15-Apr-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is there a website for calcing travel stuff?


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Proxion is 1 jump from Benten


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohh I see I found nem on the map


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im going through 601 no matter what


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah its making more and more sense to do it that way.


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	mostly just BLU testing and number of jumps/parsecs away


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	STL travel is another can of worms altogether


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im more looking at fuel usage over time


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is there some sort of estimation tool I can use that will at least get me ball park?


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nothing better than BLU testing


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but that changes with time correct?


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	which is why getting a schedule down is proper


[15-Apr-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	also.. it takes more fuel to get away from a planet than to land on one


[15-Apr-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so that you can catch your transition points in orbit and shiz


[15-Apr-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	have to excape the gravity well


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FTL travel is consistent.. orbits matter very very little with FTL


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh dude... there is no way that I am gonna have to worry about cargo space at this time in my ventures life cycle lmao


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	before a ship FTLs... they travel away for a bit... and jump close to their destination and STL into it


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	as long as fuel doesnt eat me on the there and back trip ther eis really no way this isnt more profitable then what I am doing.


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	time frames for output accounted for


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah they got to get out of the gravity well


[15-Apr-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fuel around Benten is quite cheap


[15-Apr-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so as long as I make sure to account for return trip fuel and buy it im fine


[15-Apr-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I just send my ship over night...


[15-Apr-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and if I use both of my ships in cycle im double fine


[15-Apr-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	likely 1 ship can take care of both planets


[15-Apr-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is there a local market there?


[15-Apr-23 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup, but hardly ever used


[15-Apr-23 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah but I can dump my extra food there just to save on m3 and help the peeps out there


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I do make my own HSEs tho xD


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hence the PP3 there


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	do you have some for sale?


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players with bases on JS-601c get a discount xD


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	or rather will you cause it will be a few days before I can move there


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	awesome


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is there a friends or contacts system in this game?


[15-Apr-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I am trying to grow them planet.. but not break the bank


[15-Apr-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not really, but check your COMs (left side bar)


[15-Apr-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I see it now


[15-Apr-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	closest thing to a friends/contact list


[15-Apr-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah its suitable


[15-Apr-23 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I made a temp TNP a while back... and I'm still processing TCS into HSEs


[15-Apr-23 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Very nice


[15-Apr-23 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	all a process


[15-Apr-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	indeed


[15-Apr-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	still.. HSEs are cheaper than INS... at least in my opinion


[15-Apr-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	quite a few planets in the universe require INS


[15-Apr-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	tends to be cold out there


[15-Apr-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lol


[15-Apr-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I think making money on a hostile planet is a nitch too and I like the nitches


[15-Apr-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	here is an explaination about "extra" building materials: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/building-costs/index.html

[15-Apr-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice ok


[15-Apr-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so see there are a lot of side structures


[15-Apr-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	side structures.. not really... but requirements for harshs planets... yes


[15-Apr-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	also... a single STO on a base can help a lot


[15-Apr-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	+5k tons/ +5k m3 in base storage


[15-Apr-23 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	helps a lot dealing with hefty materials


[15-Apr-23 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I think you are giving me way to much credit for the amount of resources ill draw out this early


[15-Apr-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	welllllll I think that depends on how much of a slice you are willing to give someone


[15-Apr-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Im sure even this game has people that look everywhere for the cheapeast to see if its worth it before they settle and go to the hub


[15-Apr-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I guess, just do a small trial run to test the market


[15-Apr-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah and like I said right now there is no way im ripping 2 ships worth out of the ground


[15-Apr-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	You didnt get rockafella to move into your planet bro... im a dude a pickaxe and a dream


[15-Apr-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah i noticed you doing that

**Eraser**:	yeah

**RNGzero**:	can make a lot of different setups work xD


[15-Apr-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is there anyway to know which site on a planet is good?


[15-Apr-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok


[16-Apr-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so you dont need to survay anything and you dont have to care if its next to someone?


[16-Apr-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope


[16-Apr-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	survey would be a nice touch... but in a game like this... wouldn't amoutn to much


[16-Apr-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	larger plays would pay for info they wanted instead of doing it themself xD


[16-Apr-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh what are those?


[16-Apr-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	NPC contracts for players to do.. each perseon gets sent 3 and selects one (or none) to do


[16-Apr-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh kewl


[16-Apr-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	do you only get 1 forever or 1 at a time?

**RNGzero**:	every couple days a few get sent out


[16-Apr-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[16-Apr-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	however... that doesn;t mean the reward is worth the cost


[16-Apr-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	no i get that


[16-Apr-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Eraser**:	ill check em out "soon" im finally getting everything screen wise set up


[16-Apr-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I use different screens to capture the macro micro aspects


[16-Apr-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Most players that start agriculture do Promitor... why did you select Nemesis?

**Eraser**:	and I do not regret it I feel like this will help me out in my other stuff good


[16-Apr-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	it gave several planets to be honest


[16-Apr-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and well really thats about it


[16-Apr-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Nemesis is a good start


[16-Apr-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[16-Apr-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just not the typical pick because it is farther away from the CX (both good and bad)


[16-Apr-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I didnt want to be close cause from other games ive played like this being close means that everyone tries to 1 up or 1 down you when yo usell stuff


[16-Apr-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most try to get as close to the CX as possible... but that is mainly to conserve fuel


[16-Apr-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so I figured if all else failed id sell locally and let others deal with that


[16-Apr-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'll definitely be fine then xD


[16-Apr-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	for instance with my rats, im just gonna calc the rough fuel prices it would cast me per rat, subtract that from the price of the rat and sell them on the local market... or a protion of them rather


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and anyone with a half a brain will go.. wait thats cheaper for me.


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	even at the bid price on the CX... you'd make a tidy sum


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but for now all that isnt even required cause I dont think all my production for a whole week would fill 1 transport


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	"maybe" when I start mining rock... but the first week or so you can put a lot of MREs in 500m3


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you certainly can


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I trade stuff around the universe as well


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so my intent is to reserve a portion for later start up, then a portion for current workers, then sell the rest


[16-Apr-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so I go from CX to CX buying goods and transporting them else where for profit


[16-Apr-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I could do that but right now it woul dbe easy for me to make a mistake and get a ship trapped some where with out fuel


[16-Apr-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so for now I decided to not do that lmao


[16-Apr-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I think mat rat is my fav bfr command so far


[16-Apr-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just wanted to mention there are many ways to play


[16-Apr-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	5k rats for 1 transport


[16-Apr-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup, some materials pack better than others


[16-Apr-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well I could do production for a little over 2 weeks at my current rate


[16-Apr-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	RAT.C1


[16-Apr-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh i did it wrong


[16-Apr-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plus, having your pops each their own production saves on expenses


[16-Apr-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	RAT.CI1


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	consume*


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	if prices and demand hold I think ill be on you rplanet in a little under 2 weeks


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but I want to make sure I have fall back cash as well


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the other day I assisted another player looking for advice on Katoa... they started fuel and had some issues


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fuel was hammered and below 10/u


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	like when I first started


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ooooof


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so not a lot of margin there


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just to put that into perspective


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	haha well the rat gig isnt looking so bad then ;)


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	once a fuel producer extract their own materials... they cam amke it below 4/u


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I kind of assume slower then food


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats pretty solid then


[16-Apr-23 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	to be honest its about qaunity at that point


[16-Apr-23 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	double checking... ah...around 300 SF per day


[16-Apr-23 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well that is much lower


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when fuel is up at 15/u... they can make bank tho


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so it just depends on timing an such... RATs just happen to be high


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and I think that will go on for 2-3 more weeks


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice ill cash in on it while I can and then when it lowers out I wont feel bad using it to feed an expansion


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	likely the price will not go below 80/RAT


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you could consider Gibson a well.. that is Benten's construction planet... 2 jumps away from Benten (2 jumps from Nemsis)


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was looking at that


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but im not really a constructor


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	making your own pre-fabs does help


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im gonna bust out the ol spreadsheets and make up my mind I got some time


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but so far the mining gig on the hostile planet is looking nice


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you wanted to just extract and sell.. Deimos.. and a couple others would interest you


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	could even extract H2O here and sell at the market


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ill add them to the checklist to check out


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	some times its just about effort


[16-Apr-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	very true.. and a vast majority of planets are quite hostile


[16-Apr-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	its a trueth when people say perfection is about what you can remove more then what you can add


[16-Apr-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah anywhere im gonna go im gonna have to deal with costs of hostileness or elbow a spot into something super populated


[16-Apr-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	although some resource are only found on hostile planets


[16-Apr-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	do workers "die" on hostile planets


[16-Apr-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I noticed first aid kits


[16-Apr-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope


[16-Apr-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah ok then if cost is the only risk then its not that big of a deal


[16-Apr-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but when they are not satisficed (unhappy) they will migrate away


[16-Apr-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	in rl dangerous businesses get wrecked by insurance cost cause peopel get you know hurt


[16-Apr-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[16-Apr-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but as long as they have buildings they are chill


[16-Apr-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	housing a bit a coffee


[16-Apr-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	insurance companies were hunted down early and executed... their line has since gone extinct xD


[16-Apr-23 12:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but... imagine needing  TSH.NC1 for each building


[16-Apr-23 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	things can quickly get expensive for some materials


[16-Apr-23 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lol


[16-Apr-23 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for the most part.. pioneers are easy to satisfy... higher tier pops... less so


[16-Apr-23 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I mostly use pioneers and settlers anyways


[16-Apr-23 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	if I leave a ship at brenten station will it use fuel or get charged for hanger rental?


[16-Apr-23 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope


[16-Apr-23 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	idol ships cost nothing


[16-Apr-23 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok nice


[16-Apr-23 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some players use them as modle warehouses xD


[16-Apr-23 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	mobile*


[16-Apr-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	oh yeah... you can rent a warehouse at the CX to store your goods if a ship isn;t there


[16-Apr-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	costs 100/week


[16-Apr-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	how does the reactor on ships work>


[16-Apr-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	useful for staging goods or relisting items on the market


[16-Apr-23 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[16-Apr-23 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	reactor on the ship is only used during FTL flights


[16-Apr-23 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	does it recharge over time?


[16-Apr-23 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the harder you push it the most damage you ship takes


[16-Apr-23 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I guess im asking what am I spending for using it


[16-Apr-23 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[16-Apr-23 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so it cause more repairs


[16-Apr-23 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so here is how FTL flight works


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the FTL reactor recharges untill it canbe used to make the next jump... and so on till you reach the destination


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FF fuel basically cools it faster


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	alright imma pass out


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thanks for all the time


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	take care!


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	big help getting started!


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	let me know how things go


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I willl get you updated of course!


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	👍


[16-Apr-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can do that stuff with (windows key + . )


[16-Apr-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
***aw1913** joined.*


[16-Apr-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	which is why pushign yourself to a hostile planet can be more risky then needed xD


[16-Apr-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	to be honest, competing vrs all the food bros is just as risky


[16-Apr-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but HAL and FEO are really quite havey to transport w/o refining


[16-Apr-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah imma refine them


[16-Apr-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im looking into the planning now


[16-Apr-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	two buildings on that planet is roughly before anything logicstical the same value as my ration farm right now working full out


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is a better usage of it profit wise


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im using one


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Nemesis is 4 jumps from Benten CX.. JS-601c is 3 jumps from Benten


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not really


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I guess.. HAL.CI1 is decent


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah and anything I cant  transport I can put up on the local market for less and let someone else make a slice off moving it or refining it


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	even more so now that I know labor is like it is in real life, where I have to wait for it to come to me, and I cant just click a button pay money an dhave it.


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup... I know a player on Montem who only extracts LST and sold on the LM


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	soo... I am doing a break down of labor cost right now to see if its just better to use the labor else where beside srefining it


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is there entire business... didn't even need their ships xD


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah that is basically what I am thinking of doing at first


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	only works on very populated planets


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	helps that the resources there can be made into useful materials


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I ship GRN to to burn locally... easier to transport than C


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lol


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some larger players setup entire planet just to fill with incinerators for the CoCG


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	features like that get discussed within the community from time to time


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	right


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but that is good


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	cause its not all about doing it yourself


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	letting somoene else get a job doing it is fine


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	faction contracts are relatively recent


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	quite a few different types of contracts... and the materials they ask for tend to be random (or aligned with your planet)


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	rarer contracts can be for upgrading your HQ and such


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was curious if there was a way to chang ethe order of them


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so pro the screens wish they could open more of him!


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah, I don't have the best setup.. it just works for me


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I don;t want to be switching screens often


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but this was the one that I thought given what I thought I knew that I picked, it had water, wasnt overly crowded.


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well... Benten certainly pays the most for RATs xD


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well I have "made rl businesses that are successful" so I might be doing it all wrong for a video game but I really do factor effort into the profits


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	despite 3 great agriculture planets


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	to me a profit is more then "I got more back then I spent"


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	perfectly fine


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup, some of those commands are very helpful


[16-Apr-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	hahahhaha dude I could make MREs all month at my current production and not fill 1 ship


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was really really thinking about fuel


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fuel starter make fuel for arounf 5-6/u


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but whats the production time per u


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	makes about 600 SF per day


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	per REF


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but.. I think turning that into DW and selling that would be more profitable


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	your ship STLs away from the start.. and jumps to the next system


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so there is less time between jumps


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I mean I could do that


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	that wouldnt be an issue


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what planet did you say this was I know you mentioned it before but im like looking into it now


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but there are a many other planets with other resources that can be done on


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is it pnt in buffer?


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok I think I can make this work let ssee here


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Primary issue with HSEs... you only need 1 per building or repair... and none are returned on demo xD


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ah... just type PLI than hit enter


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	using a CHP


[16-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Eraser**:	oh shit we use ddt here


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the HM cluster is Arclight area


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I can make this work man


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	You gotta remember im not a 1000000 hour player.


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	So like a small slice that meet or beats what I am doing now is most def worth it to me


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and its "different"


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	does the shipping contract thing stay after pro?


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes.. shipping and transport is an thing..


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	with PRO.. you can make and accept contracts


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh and whats a local market ad?


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	each contract can only be for 1 type of item... so if you wanted to send 2 different items... that is 2 contracts


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	that kind of makes sense


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players post buy, sell, and shipping contracts there


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	right I guess my question is whats the difference between an ad and a contract


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there isn't a difference they all lead to a contract


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it's basically a flat price for the stack... it cannot be portioned out


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope.. anyone can see the goings on of a local market


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so the person accepting the contract has to accept the whole contract not a portion of it?


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see where the conflict can come too... cause I was thinking oh maybe ill set up a gas station at specific planets, then I was like oh wait.. I bet people are doing that


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	even more so something with a high input cost


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I refine it into FLX and other goods to reduce the weight


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	complex question... but bases can be "moved"


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok let me rephrase that question


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I realized that


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	when I claim a spot on a planet is it forever, or can I give that spot up to build on a new one?


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	once you claim a plot with a core... it is yours untill that core is taken off


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I understand I cant just call a ship down to pack off my buildings and everything


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	no buying plots or the like


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	good good


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so I am locked into a planet choice if I decide to do something later


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	buildings last 180 days...at 90days 1/2 the materials used to build it are degraded


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats kind of generous


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	you have to wait 90 days


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	wait wait wait


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what happens if you rip one up after say 20 days?


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is it 100 percent?


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it is more gradual than that


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh ok


[16-Apr-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so yes... you can have temp. buildings and bases.. that you don;t intened to keep for the full 180 or 90 days


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	as the general rule of thumb is to repair every 89 days


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats ok I think I get the general gist of it


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	buildingd decay over time you get an amount of mats back based on how long it takes to decay


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and how long its been


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	roughly 89 days (or 59 depending on who you ask) is 50%


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	exactly


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeahh I go tthat vibe from other games like this that are more centered around combat


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they still get the plot though...


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the player doesn;t get it... but the governor has to still maintain those pops.


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	(there are limits)


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh so if its a good governer then they get the pop they need and the taxes are fair


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	if not people move off your planet cause they cant get their workers


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'll clerify thisa bit for you


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is the undertaking huge for being a governer?


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	workers on a planet are the planet's.. not the player's pop... technically


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	every week the planet pool resets... and tries to fill as many jobs as possible before setting the new pool


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	or get it?


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	only a handfull of them were curated by the devs to ensure plays had something to work with


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so I guess planets that dont attract enough players just cant get governers?


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	no I mean I understand that completely, I guess I am asking if the game mechanics allow for thos eplanets to have governers and its just the interest that isnt there that causes them to not have them


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh which means the players on the planet at least have to work together to get that going


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when I say the universe starts with nothing... I really mean it xD


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	no no I get that


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	no POPI...CoGC...warehouses...local markets.... nothing


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but in the long run of a game that doesnt intend to reset that is only important to the people who are "there"


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	governor have little actually control aside from taxes...


[16-Apr-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they is how they get things done... by allocating taxes


[16-Apr-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	morning peeps


[16-Apr-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Hi Eraser


[16-Apr-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Is it morning for you or are you working in shifts


[16-Apr-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Having a good day/morning?


[16-Apr-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	naa its morning for me


[16-Apr-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And sunday. So hopefully some leisure time ahead


[16-Apr-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	meh

**Eraser**:	ugh I see why a lot of people buy their prefabs lmao


[16-Apr-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I mean make their own


[16-Apr-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Eraser** deleted this message.*


[16-Apr-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup


[16-Apr-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	sup bro!


[16-Apr-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	pre-fabs are a good market to be in


[16-Apr-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	You I am glad I sent my ship yesterday


[16-Apr-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	cause if not I would have ran out of outfits and my workers would have been naked


[16-Apr-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and im not running that kind of farm


[16-Apr-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	xD


[16-Apr-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so it ended up working out to be honest


[16-Apr-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	consumables/production materials for 5-6 days and send a ship every 5ish days works well


[16-Apr-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I am getting my "cycles" down now


[16-Apr-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for the most part, players want to avoid their production lines stopping


[16-Apr-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	damn union bosses get all mad if people dont have uniforms


[16-Apr-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	need to set the workers up for success


[16-Apr-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	dude im building an eden on neo eden, and people want to wear clothes... like this is the problem with humans


[16-Apr-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can even make those clothes with a BMP if you are included to go that route


[16-Apr-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	most likely I wont


[16-Apr-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	to be honest I have it down so that besides construction costs the outfits are my only cost


[16-Apr-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and im really just ok not doing it all myself lol


[16-Apr-23 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	even more so if I intend to transition to mining later which I still do


[16-Apr-23 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	this is more about getting this to be sustainable so it can feed me miners


[16-Apr-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players typically need to choose between self-sustain and profits... just depends


[16-Apr-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	give me that money bb


[16-Apr-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	both have their advantages and disadvantages... playstyle does matter


[16-Apr-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY


[16-Apr-23 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sometime logistics trumps profit


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ohh? Sure sure I cant hear you from my space yatche


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	seee im gonna be smart and trick the other players into doing the logistics for me


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	cause MONEYYYYYY


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well.. if a sungle base s pushing 250t/m3 in imports/exports... you'd need to get a starting ship there every 2 days


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players are not going to be able to run many planets that way


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I have all the time in the world brother... to be honest this game would be more fun to me if I could "be more on top of it"


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but the planning is doing that for now


[16-Apr-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	planning is a good portion of things


[16-Apr-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but the start can certainly be slow


[16-Apr-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeppers


[16-Apr-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just take it easy... check out the CX, prices, surrounding planets, ask a bunch of questions


[16-Apr-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lol I think you already know I got the question part down


[16-Apr-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	maybe checkout a corp


[16-Apr-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	naaaa


[16-Apr-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fair enough


[16-Apr-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see myself starting this game mining or whatever and then honestly just becoming a trader


[16-Apr-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	are there like legit space trucking corps, or does that make it hard with the ship limits?


[16-Apr-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	tho I love how they have real candle charts for the stuff I guess that is good


[16-Apr-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and I have been checking all the cxes and getting familiar with prices for sure


[16-Apr-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what was that map site you linked? I totally forgot to book mark it


[16-Apr-23 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nm google found it for me hehe


[16-Apr-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ok back,


[16-Apr-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most traders and transport work occurs independently or through intra-corps trades


[16-Apr-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	trading resources around helps fill the gap waiting for a base to get online or expand


[16-Apr-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most CX to CX routes take a ~34h flight


[16-Apr-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	eah


[16-Apr-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah*


[16-Apr-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I think first the trick is to make my first easy million then care about other stuff lol


[16-Apr-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	w/o basic or pro to take actual shipping contracts, it's mainly a CX to CX type thing players can do with a spare ship... or they are going that ways already


[16-Apr-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	my 2nd base was on Deimos (antares)... while my 1st base was on Proxion


[16-Apr-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oof


[16-Apr-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so I "secured" trade route goods that way


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Benten doesn't have much in the ALO/AL department... so bring that up from Ant was worth it


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	did I read it right that this game has an api?


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the data is collected by players interacting with the game (not automatic)


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since automatic would be against the TOS


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was thinking about using it to write like anaylist type software


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	or rather convert what I had to it


[16-Apr-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Denrol** left.*


[16-Apr-23 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	how many bases are we allowed?


[16-Apr-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and do warehouses require a base there? I think you mentioned you can just rent them right?


[16-Apr-23 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh I found it nice


[16-Apr-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	free players can have up to 7 bases... warehouses... most planets have them for rent


[16-Apr-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah i saw the warehouses


[16-Apr-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	on dustballs.. that infrastructure would need to be built


[16-Apr-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	people really do like their spicy herbs tho lol


[16-Apr-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the game itself... no... but a player supported one yes


[16-Apr-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	DW.CI1


[16-Apr-23 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	RAT.CI1


[16-Apr-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	instead of selling to a bid, you could choose to list your goods


[16-Apr-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah im looking at that now


[16-Apr-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	may take a bit longer to get the money... but the difference will likely make it worth it


[16-Apr-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	money that doesn;t make it back on the ship (via goods/etc.)... is still fine because you would have the time to place bids before the next supply run


[16-Apr-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	im most likely gonna get pro some time soon too


[16-Apr-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is fine, you'd be able to offer shipping to and from Nemesis


[16-Apr-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can help pay for fuel


[16-Apr-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and if I understand correctly you have pro/basic to use them?


[16-Apr-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes... Pro to post & accept ads/contracts... Basic (expired pro) can only accept ads/contracts


[16-Apr-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	awesome


[16-Apr-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	even with basic.. you can offer goods to other... just tell them to send you a contract for it xD


[16-Apr-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah exactly


[16-Apr-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is multi accounting against the rules? I assume so?


[16-Apr-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes


[16-Apr-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhhhh


[16-Apr-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats why I bet a lot of players do stuff their selves


[16-Apr-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	once you're on multiple bases... multi-accounting is less attractive


[16-Apr-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	lol


[16-Apr-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	with 2 basic ships... players can take care of like 7-10 planets


[16-Apr-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	they are "big"


[16-Apr-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'd place it more around 5-6... as that give your ships sometime to trade


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Honestly if I could sell them and buy cheaper ones with smaller cargo hold and less fuel consumption I would.


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most players get their second based from 40-60 days in


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	with RAT prices.. agriculture players will likely take less time than that


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was thinking I would have it in like half that time but I havent done any hard calcs


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well... getting everything you need is just one step.. than you need to plan the trip out there


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh true


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and that "trip" is not goign to make you anything..


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	not just "im ready for base 2"


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	exactly


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I get that


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	getting a second farm plot almost broke me so I could see where setting a base up is a big investment


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	most def gonna need to get more orginized so im posting buy orders and not just paying market price


[16-Apr-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	my second bace was day 49... but I could have done it sooner.. but waited to have a larger overhead in liquid capital


[16-Apr-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ill most likely feel the same way


[16-Apr-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just to cover incidentals and price movements


[16-Apr-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	Im still not sure I understand how to attract more work force... did you say it is based on jobs I have ready to go? So like if I build this other farmstead that should cause people to start coming right?


[16-Apr-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I have "living space for them"


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	make production buildings


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok kewl I just wanted to make sure I understood that


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	workers from the planet will be assigned to it (number)


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nice ok


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	after a week.. those workers will be "yours"


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahhhhh


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just make sure to house those workers... otherwise their efficiently will be very low.


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	does the gov have any control over specifically who gets what or just his job to provide it based on the consumables and what not


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope.. governor does not distribute pops...


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I thought not after reading the guide just wanted to double check


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	those "habitats" can be whatever your imagination wants them to be


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	hahaha


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	governor's job is to collect taxes and spend taxes (hopefully) maintaining the planet


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nextly can you have multi bases on the same planet? I assume no


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope.. which is why you can expand the base's are to 1k max area


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	which you use permits for


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and is the limit based on bases or permits?


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but I'd rather spend the permit on a new base than expanding an existing base


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	bases with 1 permit get 500 area.... expanded an existing base with a permit only gives +250 area


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I get that


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	its more "area" to get a new base, but in the interest of "area having a value" and maybe it being better to expand bases in high value areas


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is therea  limit to permits or only bases?


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	exactly


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	permits are gained by upgrading the HQ... there is no cap... but permits get very very expensive later


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ahh so there is kind of a cap for a free account


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I see


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you want some numbers.... https://pct.fnar.net/hq/

[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	you werent kidding


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup... fabs get expensive


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I guess if humans rapidly colonizing the galaxy need anything its food and buildings


[16-Apr-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	so it makes sense


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	likely you'll stick with farms, rigs, and FPs on Nemesis... then use some of the to supply a 2nd base


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yep


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I might just pepperage farms this biotch too


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if your 2nd base is manufacturing.. you'd get into weavers / BMPs.


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	right now I think im gonna get some money stacked up and then do a real like planning phase


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	pretend as if I was trying to get investors and just plan out the "future of the company"


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and really decide


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	a chemistry base would be for CHPs: CL, FLX, NS.. and POLs PG/EPO


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I most likely wont use my bases to branch out into other industries, I know not everything in real life applies here but that is really bad  idea typically (imagine if every company tried to make everything they needed) most likely ill "saturate and then internionalize"


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sounds good and it doesn't hurt to get some advice on your plan


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I agree


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I will most def run it by you when I know more


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and ill learn to spell too


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah, not just me.. but players on the help channel have helpful perspectives


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	noted


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	more complex materials will need multiple bases to work on things


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	could I have picked your planet to start on or does it not allow "hostile planets" as starting planets?


[16-Apr-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	only planets that use MCG


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but those can be anywhere you want


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	doesn;t have to be a starting planet... but the only opportunity to get on some is with your 1st base.


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but thats less important to me then others.


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I enjoy niches... doesn;t always mean going for the popular planets


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	exactly


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nitch af


[16-Apr-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah... benten doesn;t have a decent CUO deposit


[16-Apr-23 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so I enjoy doing things like that


[16-Apr-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	right


[16-Apr-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I like the time aspect of this... I mean at first I was like its slow but it does allow the game to progress better imho


[16-Apr-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it gives people with lives a chance to play on an even footing


[16-Apr-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there is enough time for many more people to get a say.. instead of the players on 20h a day


[16-Apr-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when players say..."the CX's margins are too wide" or "CXs aren't active enough" have not considered what this game is about


[16-Apr-23 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	everythign takes justa bit more time to happen because transportation matters...


[16-Apr-23 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what building does "refinement"


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@Eraser, depends on the material


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	click on the material's icon.. and it'll give a list of recipes and buildings that deal with it


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FEO is refined in a smelter (SME)


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	thats it!


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FE (iron) is still quite heavy itself


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeppers


[16-Apr-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but if you refine that into Pre-fabs in a PP1... you get much better rates


[16-Apr-23 04:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	see here is my base plan... move into your planet, set up a big mining op cause the iron ore is fat there, sell the ore and extra rations on the local market, and transport stuff to breten just for upkeep... then.. people are like woah if I mine there then there are rations for sale there


[16-Apr-23 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	we will see I guess


[16-Apr-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	plus im good under pressure


[16-Apr-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	;)


[16-Apr-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	little js-601c humor for you there


[16-Apr-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I think you'd be fine


[16-Apr-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	preliminary calculations yield an infininate amount of outcomes but show my current path to be at least a gain.


[16-Apr-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if your pumping HAL... you'll likely get between 200-250/u


[16-Apr-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	cost to extract HAL on JS-601c is ~45/u


[16-Apr-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	(cost of labor / units extracted)


[16-Apr-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FEO on JS-601c is ~17/u


[16-Apr-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what in the communist handbook manifesto is that!


[16-Apr-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	(im kidding)


[16-Apr-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what thats like 5% right?


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not quite sure what you mean... but FEO and FE sucjs to transport


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was just kidding


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	however for both resources... that is a very low cost to extract


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	cost doesn;t account for fixed/sunk costs of the building


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sure 1/7 of the price.. but add transport fees to it (those depend on how many per ship you can carry)


[16-Apr-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	of course


[16-Apr-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	also depends on the amount of demand for the stuff... so.. a lot can vary


[16-Apr-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oh of course just to restate I wasnt stating the extraction cost was expensive


[16-Apr-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I was just joking


[16-Apr-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	dont worry govenator ill still vote for you


[16-Apr-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	all good, I just wanted to make sure


[16-Apr-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I can tell its not expensive given what you told me you got in tax money and how many settled plots there are


[16-Apr-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I've kept the taxes low


[16-Apr-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	nod nod


[16-Apr-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	after our conversation, a larger player set down a base... I'm expectign they'll use 1k pioneers


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	hahahahah danggggg


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	they are listening!


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	stop listening!


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nah, that player doesn;t have a Nemesis base


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	He has an alt


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	"They" are always watching


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	very unlikely


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	always watching!


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I have enough pioneers anyways xD


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	or maybe the word of how good of a gov you are is starting to spread to the galaxy far and wide


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and befroe you know it you can make a deathstar


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and the extra base helps the planet grow further


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I know I was just kidding


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	we want all the bros there


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	but we dont want them there before I get there


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Benten doesn;t have much of an FE supply itself


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most of the FE on the market is imported


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Gibson's deposite is fine.. but not enough for a serious operation


[16-Apr-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	mmmmmm fe


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there is a reason I'm on KI-840c... which is ~3 days away from Nemesis


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	FEO


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can only fit 64 of those bastards on a starting ship


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	we will see about that ;)


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	oorrr I could just sell it and let you do that :P


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	and hopefully get more miner 49er dudes to your planet ;)


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	could certainly try... but FEO/HAL is soo plentiful 1 EXT is likely all you could handle


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	1 ext, couple SMEs, and PP1s or iron consuming building would be fine


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	what is cost for feo?


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	(just so I have both)


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	its 1/7th of current market price


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	well I dont at least


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	is there place like http://prosperous.freecluster.eu/ but shows you more detail about planets?


[16-Apr-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	maybe one with a key that can tell me a meaningful distance between the solar systems?


[16-Apr-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch this would likely be the most helpful


[16-Apr-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	awesome, what I am looking to try and calculate is fuel burn per au or jump or something, based on disntance is the formula somewhere?


[16-Apr-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	not really


[16-Apr-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	FTL jumps are measured in parsecs... so 1 jump at 3 parsecs will cost less then 6 parsecs


[16-Apr-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	show the number of jumps to a designated system... and with proper settings... can show a lot of detail about a system


[16-Apr-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the best way to test is the BLU menu with a full invetory


[16-Apr-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	I know you can test but im wondering if there is a formula that I can use to just calculate, and a way to figure out how many parsecs long each jump lane is


[16-Apr-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ok i can figure out how far each jump is like you said with testing


[16-Apr-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	of course the stl part of the site is blank on sct


[16-Apr-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes, the STL part is not as consistent as FTL part


[16-Apr-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	because orbits throw a large wrench into that calc


[16-Apr-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	yeah I get that


[16-Apr-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	hmm


[16-Apr-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eraser**:	ill just have to play around and reverse engineer somethinga s I go

**Aufricer**:	Thanks to the many donations we currently have a huge plus in population, that will give us extra unemployed workforce (ready and willing to work, latest with next distribution).


[20-Apr-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	As you may have relized I have NOT increased the "active" level of the infrastructure. That would probably raise the level of health and safety even more but would also suck the demand for inputs. I had the strong feeling, that wont be necessary. I am planning to keep the level as it is at the moment. With stuff in reserve we should balance the deficit of tax income in a while.


[20-Apr-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Not going to promis anything but depending on reserves and popi developement a decrease of tax at least temporary may be possible

**Aufricer**:	Hi everybody. I relized, that I had not run for gov. So I did it again. As a note. For the next term someoone else might need to step up. The period after falls into a longer holiday and also pro licence is expiring and I wont prolong it while in holiday.


[18-Jun-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Next week I will sum up the balance again and will also care for the next term. If someone is ready/willing to take over the duty after that (maybe I come back after 1 or 2 terms) - would be helpfull

[19-Jun-23 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	A word for the balance. If I did not forgot to add something. Costs are COCG	69854 Safety	130325 Inf	86400 Wild	63850 Emergency	45000


[19-Jun-23 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	That is total spendings of approx 396k CIS (rounded, estimated, shipping costs, fees etc. not included)


[19-Jun-23 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In this election term there had been 3 tax payments of in total 332.170 CIS.


[19-Jun-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Current deficit on spending is 63k and it will increase a bit more as the next COCG is due (check LM adds for DW and RAT)


[19-Jun-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	One tax cycle is worth around 105k CIS, the next will be in 6d.


[19-Jun-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Therefore I would say we are close to be balanced but that comes on the cost of having the POPI (remember pioneers) without big reserves, but still fine for everybody except those with huge expension plans, that better do it shortly before POPI upgrade.


[19-Jun-23 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	... the moment I was typing the LM adds got accepted. So COCG upkeep increased to 103k CIS (still PE and MCG not counted) and total deficit to 96k CIS for that period.


[19-Jun-23 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	That was me. Was I not supposed to do that? I also donated a few hundred DW to the Safety station.


[19-Jun-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	I also need pioneers- currently I only have the initial 200 (new base) while I need 800

**Aufricer**:	Pioneers I guess


[19-Jun-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@Gilith it was "only" 10k CIS


[19-Jun-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Best is to donate to the safety station worth around that


[19-Jun-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@Kindling Everything fine. Those adds are a way to return tax to local players. From time to time I just buy consumables for POPI or COCG local.


[19-Jun-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Next COCG cycle is due in about a few h. I was stocking for it a bit


[19-Jun-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it's a new base and I don't have much to donate, so I prefer cash :)


[19-Jun-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jun-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jul-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Looks like Safety Station has already been downgraded to lv 3 and the only other recommended change was taxes which I'll wait and just see how everything goes before touching :) Hopefully I don't have to at all lol

**Aufricer**:	COCG	201230 Safety	106890 Inf	10000 Wild	30000


[28-Jul-23 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Thats what I had wrote down as costs during last cycle. Note that there was a lot of donations, thus only the costs for COCG with about 202.000 CIS seems to be true


[28-Jul-23 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In the 10 terms the costs exceeded the tax by around 100k CIS. Not counting the donations to infrastructure etc. But that is fine.


[28-Jul-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Income iswas about 105 recently with a peak at 115k CIS every 7d.


[28-Jul-23 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In other words there is "only" 200k CIS left for the whole POPI. Either the feeding is not sufficient, there are donations or the tax simply have to be increased to solve issues with lacking population in a medium term


[28-Jul-23 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Sooner or later I will probably help by donating more POPI (Hospital and Security drone posts, that would give an option to use 1 of those insteadt 3 or 4 of the smaller).


[28-Jul-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	But thats more a long term whenever I feel like topic.


[28-Jul-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

If anyone has any input on demand feel free to DM me. There were a few things that didn't get filled in infrastructure but it doesn't seem to negatively impact the report. I will experiment and play around with this this week :)

[17-Aug-23 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Should be good, I've went ahead and ran a tech immigration program instead of pushing for wildlife parks. Should be good on techs for a bit


[17-Aug-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am experimenting with some things that require Technicians but have not decided to keep them - dpends on how much effort is required.


[17-Aug-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I have provided a bunch of supplies for Safety Station and Infirmary and  amd working on supplies for the Wildlife park.


[17-Aug-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I will look for the tech immigration program to see if I can add anything.


[17-Aug-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I would like to run a couple of ORC and a LAB and CHP.


[17-Aug-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	next pop report the program hits


[17-Aug-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Out of curiosity, does that mean infrastructure is immediate? In this case, referring to Wildlife Parks?


[17-Aug-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	infrastructure satisfaction depends upon how often the POPI needs are met (and by how huch %)


[17-Aug-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	much*


[17-Aug-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when the pop. report posts... the tally throughout the week determines the changes


[17-Aug-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Ok so general idea higher the happiness % and minimal unemployment % is good. Both being affected different by a program vs infrastructure


[17-Aug-23 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	unemployment up to (I think) 12% or 15% is not counted against the pop's happiness


[17-Aug-23 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	I've only been keeping up with DW for wildlife, that can be expanded to keep up with other resources. Taxes may be raised sometime this week. Currently the ~120k/week is *just* enough to satisfy most minimums


[17-Aug-23 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Not adding in my own DW production


[17-Aug-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Looks like our best option would be either SOI or FOD for adding resources to wildlife parks


[17-Aug-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	SOI, FOD, or PFE are usually better than DW


[17-Aug-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	FOD requiring 30 per 3 days @ ~300ea. Or SOI requiring 50 per 7 days @ ~465ea


[17-Aug-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for JS-601c, I have a CHP on Elon just for SOI


[17-Aug-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can supply it for ~230/u


[17-Aug-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Fod costing 18k per 6 days or SOI costing only 23k per 7 days. Which honestly isn't bad


[17-Aug-23 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	@RNGzero, would you be willing to fill 200 SOI currently for 40k?


[17-Aug-23 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	each week 1 park only needs 35 SOI


[17-Aug-23 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	50 per 7 days, filled up to last a month


[17-Aug-23 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	50 per 10* days


[17-Aug-23 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Oh sorry, my brain said 7 lol


[17-Aug-23 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	So month and a half


[17-Aug-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Currently Tech Immigrant program is running and will end next pop report (6.5 days) which will provide 100 technicians. SOI and DW should also be supplied to the Wildlife Infrastructure to help in the aid of technicians in the coming week.


[17-Aug-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	I will look into FOD as well after the next pop report.


[17-Aug-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I am making some FOD and will eventually be making PFE and SOI. I have made 4 DEC and have 3 in the queue.


[17-Aug-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	BRM is a bit of a problem right now but I will be building on a BRM planet soon.


[17-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Hold off on SOI production @BlueHeeler. I'll take care of that for the time being


[17-Aug-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Okay. I am not ready to make it yet anyway. But there is not BRM in Benton so that will be my first initiative.


[17-Aug-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Ya just don't worry about it for now. I've got it covered basically through my time as governor


[17-Aug-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	And then some


[17-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	Gotcha


[17-Aug-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ArduinoPirate**:	Taxes have been changed around just a bit. I forgot to mention earlier! Just a small increase to Resource Extraction, Food Industries, Agriculture, and Electronics. This is to offset costs of POPI materials needed and may change another time in the coming week. I will try to add more resources than just the base stuff I have been to help grow happiness

Thank you to those that donated FOD as well as other POPI mats! Pioneer unemployment is extremely low so we may have to do something about that so we don't run out

[06-Sep-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For the next term I will probably return tax to the previous high and DOUBLE it.


[06-Sep-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also the active level of safety station should be set to 4 (could be done already).


[06-Sep-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	There is a lot of material/donations already available for POPI. So it will take a few weeks for my to figure out the current costs to keep it stable


[06-Sep-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Expect after DOUBLING the tax a sharp reduction afterwards. Tax income was short for maybe 10-15 % earlier but we have been always a bit tight with pioneer reserve pool


[06-Sep-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	After reading my chat with Arduino I would say at least some pioneer tax will be reduced to 18

**Aufricer**:	Hi everyone. Just changed the collector of tax. I have also preparer a new taxation scheme.


[21-Sep-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	It will be - as announced - roughly double tax as it was during my last term.


[21-Sep-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I had some talk with Arduino - so I expect , thanks to all your donations and special contracts, a low demand on tax money


[21-Sep-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In turn the new taxation scheme will not be put into action - beside lowering 2 or three tax to the double tax niveau.


[21-Sep-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	That will be done later, when I am on a computer with the sheet where all new tax values (and the old once) are written down.


[21-Sep-23 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I like to remember, that once the new tax is active I will compare it with planet costs and then reduce them again step by step until the equilibrium is meet


[21-Sep-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	As final tax expect sthg. a bit higher as it was 2 months ago. I will pay more attention to reserve pioneer workforce (e.g. higher active Popi level)


[21-Sep-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Those that like to offer/continue contracts for delivery are invited to contact me ingame or in the faction discord

**Aufricer**:	Just a side note: 2 d ago the first tax money from the new gov cycle was received: 35.710 CIS. But with long lasting orders (tax is only paid after an order is finished or canceled) the real tax volume will be significantly higher


[26-Sep-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	At the same time a lot of donations for the POPI was monitored. So 0 costs till today and tax reserves are buffering

[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thoern**:	you may reconsider you contract. I don't thing that anyone will sell you OVE for 0,8CIS


[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thoern**:	when CX price is at 90


[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thoern**:	lol, big change to 0.95CIS per OVE. If you really think that production cost of OVE is lower then 1 CIS then good luck buying it


[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thoern**:	you may need it :P


[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**silentium_noxe**:	oh, do you mean that price for all contract. sorry


[05-Oct-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	ill only want you to if you agree not to sell under 160 cis at the cx


[19-Oct-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	I extract (1 extractor) SCR and smelt (2 smelters) it into S. But I also smelt ALO, FEO and STL all for my own use. My requirement for S is small so I wind up selling quite a bit of S and SCR. Compare to my mail sale item selling S and SCR is spare change.


[19-Oct-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	*compared  and *main sale item


[19-Oct-23 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Aufricer**:	When I started (yes on NEM). I had some EXT for MM farming. But rarely made S out of it. But that was very different times then. But SCR helped me to survive.


[20-Oct-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I then made my own BFABS with importing LST or FE from MOR.A trip to MOR was a thing (as FF was not yet available/produced). But with my own BFABS  I saved like 70% on market price. Took me like 100d for my second base (I am sure I could check how old the Coremodule is, but lets say 100d)

**Ryst**:	5k available PIOs is a ton. I have a full base and am using only 950. If any group of players is going to be expanding that quickly, they should probably give a heads-up beforehand...


[26-Oct-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**q333**:	300 by 20 poeple and its more than gone


[26-Oct-23 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Right. But also, only about 6000 new PIOs have been put to work in the last 8 weeks combined. So the probability of burning through 5k PIOs in the next 6 days is highly unlikely. It *could* happen. But it probably won't. 🤷‍♂️

**Aufricer**:	But its a good opportunity to ask everybody here: Is more upkeep needed ? I did not see a need for that until now. There is still a lot of donations for different POPI and I have an eye on the chamber of commerce.

**sisso**:	so.... getting start is too slow... I played a couple of years ago until equid of 700k and 3 bases.... food price is down and construction prefabs high. I will take a long time.... Looks like there is a new loan contracts that looks sweet. How probable is that if I create a loan contract of 100k-200k on 10 payments of 7 days with 0.2 (default) be accepted? I will need to migrate from basic to premium account for a while them.


[30-Nov-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Probably pretty likely. I'd take you up on that if you send the contract.

[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	Numbers aren't perfect but it's close enough to plan full bases out and such. I've got mine open 24/7 always planning or tweaking bases

**Elongatedgoose**:	Nah imma do my wont spreadsheet


[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	I use those as well but for planning out routes or keeping track of contracts and stuff. I use the prunplanner simply for base management + keeping track of how much I'm producing and consuming daily


[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ConstellationExpress**:	You don't want to see my spreadsheets xDD


[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Dec-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sisso**:	Aufricer, you should thanks me. I create a huge motivation for people to vote on you. Even for those are not planing to vote. Btw, if you are pocking some of our taxes, I want a little share on that.


[06-Dec-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@sisso I will check soon again on tax. Still a lot of donations for Popi. So maybe we lower tax again


[06-Dec-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The minimum STL setting is usually twice as slow for ~5% less fuel


[17-Jan-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	FTL is the reactor usage right?


[17-Jan-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yes


[17-Jan-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	that is 21h to not including back tho


[17-Jan-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That seems right


[17-Jan-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	so 2 day trip


[17-Jan-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yup. Just wanted to make sure you weren't accidentally setting yourself out at a super slow speed


[17-Jan-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	yee!


[17-Jan-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	now i need to figure out how much my stuff gonna cost


[17-Jan-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	o shit


[17-Jan-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Also, for anyone looking for something to haul, I posted 6 shipping contracts for 11k each from Nemesis -> BEN


[17-Jan-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	forgot ill be eating some of my rats


[17-Jan-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	i got free ships for the moment so let me look


[17-Jan-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	When you're there you should look at picking up PWO and possibly COF. They'll improve your efficiency


[17-Jan-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	when you get pwo does it take over for ove? or do you need both?


[17-Jan-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You need both


[17-Jan-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	how do i find your contracts?


[17-Jan-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And you don't want to run out of OVE (or RAT or DW)


[17-Jan-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	i make rat and dw so im good on thos


[17-Jan-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	They'd be on the local market (LM JS-299a) but they are a PRO/BASIC only feature


[17-Jan-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	wait so i got to be pro lic to accept?


[17-Jan-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yup. Devs restrict access to person-to-person contracts to prevent abuse (and because they have to eat)


[17-Jan-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But you can trade on the CX without restriction


[17-Jan-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	ahh


[17-Jan-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	took alook at the pro stuff. it is in euro i use usd where im from


[17-Jan-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep, same here. Their payment provider takes care of it. You pay in USD whatever the current exchange rate is


[17-Jan-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	cool


[17-Jan-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	ill look at that tomorrow tho. mind if i contact you in the future about those contracts?


[17-Jan-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you end up putting a lot of time into the game it's definitely worth it because afterwards you drop to BASIC which still lets you accept (but not post) contracts.


[17-Jan-24 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Sure! I do almost all of my business in and out of Nemesis by shipping contract


[17-Jan-24 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Really only visit once every 90 days for repairs


[17-Jan-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	is this planet active or are there alot of dead players?


[17-Jan-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It's definitely active. Most chat just happens in global or in the community Discord


[17-Jan-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	ahh


[17-Jan-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And my ships have other things they need to do


[17-Jan-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Another thing: If you can afford another building when you stop at the CX it may be good to buy it to start expanding


[17-Jan-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	i was thinking that. would it be a bad idea to have like 4 farms 2 food processors and like 3 rigs?


[17-Jan-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	just to nearly automate rats and dw?


[17-Jan-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	im hoping at some point i can automate ove then from there slowly automater everything else


[17-Jan-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yeah, seems like a good plan. Nemesis has a high fertility and lots of water so it's a good place to do that


[17-Jan-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	also i found it funny the person who named the planet is gone


[17-Jan-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It's not so good for things like constructing prefabs to build buildings, but that can be done on other planets (like Gibson next door)


[17-Jan-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I think it was someone named Frostwood?


[17-Jan-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It was named after a corporation, Nemesis


[17-Jan-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	ahh


[17-Jan-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	can you buy people out?


[17-Jan-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	like kinda a hostal takeover?


[17-Jan-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No


[17-Jan-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If they've cornered a market you could out compete them but nothing direct


[17-Jan-24 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	ahh. well there goes evil plan number 1


[17-Jan-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	For planning things out I think there are 3 good ways: Wing it maybe with some pen and paper, Develop your own spreadsheets, or use PrUN Planner: https://prunplanner.org/


[17-Jan-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Any or all of them can be fun


[17-Jan-24 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	aight yay! thank you.


[17-Jan-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	when i play math games like this i tend to do my own planing but this game is big


[17-Jan-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Maybe a bit in the deep end but here's the unofficial API: https://doc.fnar.net/


[17-Jan-24 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	https://fio.fnar.net/


[17-Jan-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	aight im guessing the api adds the planner directly into the game?


[17-Jan-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It pulls info from the game for use in other tools like your own spreadsheets or the planner


[17-Jan-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	https://rest.fnar.net/csv/prices for all the prices in CSV format


[17-Jan-24 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	hell ya. thanks man. ill look into them. for now got to get off and go to work. catch ya later

[27-Jan-24 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Buy it or produce it. But I guess for you it should be buying on Cx


[27-Jan-24 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For questions about playing global or help chat is a better starter


[27-Jan-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mac-Flar**:	Hi @Kratargon like Aufricer already said without PRO license you have to fly to Benton Station (CXL) and by it there and bring it back with you ship. But ceep an eye on Transpot cost. Don't fly to fast that will burn to much fuel and will not pay off


[27-Jan-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Morithalon**:	Hi @Kratargon yes, you can buy it from the Benton Station Exchange, but also keep an eye out for Contracts that reward BSE. I have stockpiled a small supply just from contracts alone. Just make sure it is something you can fulfill within the timeframe and won't be a detriment to your production goals.

**Aufricer**:	However we are at about 140k CIS tax each 7d. Thats 560k in a 28d cycle (1 election).


[07-Feb-24 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Cocg cost amount to about 320k. And in future I will provide all POPI infrastructure except


[07-Feb-24 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Art gallery with input. I just filled an excel sheet and came up to 2.300k CIS if everything is provided. But cutted some inputs out.


[07-Feb-24 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	My quick and dirty calcilations come up with an estimated cost of about 1.330k CIS cost in 4 weeks. Thus I will - once at home - check my sheet there and adjust tax to the numbers I had prepared a few months ago.


[07-Feb-24 03:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Expect tax that support agriculture and food production and punish to some degree everything else (as it is now).


[07-Feb-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	Agriculture is farmsteads correct? will you be punishing Food processors and rigs?

[07-Feb-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I think I explained it in 07/23 a bit. Focus is on agriculture (farmsteadt and HYF as well as ORC) and food processing (IVP, FER, FP)


[07-Feb-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	chemistry (to make NS ) is also a bit focused


[07-Feb-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Other industries are "relatively" punished. Depending on new tax income those fees will be adjusted again


[07-Feb-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	That all seems a little backwards... If Ag gets the COGC bonus and is the bulk of production, that should be what's taxed the highest, not the lowest.


[07-Feb-24 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I agree on that, you should charge the people who are getting the COGC bonus because the profit the most


[07-Feb-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	they*


[07-Feb-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I thought its an agri planet. Agricultural stuff needs to be produced (it is/was even quite expensive on CX). So if you want to do electronics or construction there is other places, that might be better. NEM capacity for agri (and food) should be focused. And I believe, thats what most people do here.


[07-Feb-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	But if there is a real strong dissent adjusting taxation (to be closer) is possible


[07-Feb-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And I will monitor the tax income. Tax was never that high on NEM - at least for 2 years


[07-Feb-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Main reason I set up a base here was for farms and water. The dirt on Gibson will grow stuff, but it isn't terribly productive, and water is always in short supply there.

[07-Feb-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	Im under the impression that low taxes for agri would encourage agri production. why farm on a high tax agri world if you get no profit. im still new so thats just my view.


[07-Feb-24 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	also how does chemistry function on this planet? we only have oxygen and that SCR. looking through the SCR line it seem like alot of work to melt it down into useable components


[07-Feb-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	Mine the SCR with an extractor and ship it to the CX at Benten. Let someone else have the headache of smelting it.


[07-Feb-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	It's only used in 4 products and only one is suitable for someone starting out. The other three require either a LAB or CHP, and those are not cheap.

[07-Feb-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Feb-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Something to keep in mind: If most/many people have Agriculture plots here — which should be the case with it being an Ag COGC — taxes raised *slightly* on that industry will be spread across a lot of production. Which means more tax income to be used to keep COGC & POPI running, while having minimal impact on Ag profits.


[08-Feb-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ryst**:	Perhaps part of the reason that tax income is low is because most of the high tax rates are being charged to production that makes up a minor portion of planetary output.


[08-Feb-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	It was 9 for agri pioneer before my summer and resulting in small deficit + popi /unemployement near 0%.


[08-Feb-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	It was lowered to 5 (Minimum on a faction planet) after that. Alot of you donated, so allmost no effort/cash needed. But I had worked out the current tax scheme at that time. And yes of course - most people do agri and food and probably ressource extraction


[08-Feb-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	It should bring the majority of tax. Depending on how much taxation will be lowered again. For now I just set the maximum level on


[08-Feb-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Savety station (was 5 before) and I will see if I have to increase it for


[08-Feb-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Infirmary. Still not sure how much input is realy needed to keep population available. In summer we had been close to lacking pioneers but in the end never faced a real shortage

[21-Feb-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trucidus**:	I set an order to extract some sulphur crystals for I dont know what and one to make a little fuel...


[21-Feb-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trucidus**:	And then....?


[21-Feb-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	This probably isn’t the best planet for fuel refining. It doesn’t have any of the parts of fuel. If you want to continue doing fuel stuff here you can fly one of your ships to the station (BEN) and pick up some more supplies like another building and PWO or COF to boost your workforce


[21-Feb-24 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Or you could start over with the COLIQ command. If you want to do fuel I’d advise starting on Katoa. And if you’re here I’d advise doing something with agriculture (food, carbon, etc)


[21-Feb-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xensored**:	For AMM you should have a look at Biogenesis. But in case you need only small amounts, AMM can be better to buy from CX than produce yourself. Usually AMM is cheap at BEN

[03-Mar-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkBlaireau**:	If you're talking about the different types of materials; Fuels, Gasses, Building Prefabs, and all the rest; I suspect it has to do with the way the database is set up, to try and cut down on search times, but, only the developers could tell you for certain. If you're talking about the 4 different active currencies, that is covered pretty well in the back story for the game.

[04-Mar-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vedurin**:	If you want to help your DB then you usually set up a limitation of maximum entries you query when displaying a page of information. The commodity categories have varying amounts of entries, they are an aspect of user friendlyness. So you don't get a huge list of all commodities at once. That also has the effect to reduce the size of resultsets you get from the database, but like i said, when your goal is to reduce DB load then you use limits like 10 items, 20 items, 50 items or such per data query.


[04-Mar-24 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vedurin**:	If the categories makes it harder for you try to look up materials you need and see what category they are before you go to the exchange or switch through all the categories in the exchange a few times to learn the colors each category has. Those two things help me.

**Aufricer**:	Said company asked about adding technicians to his/her base


[06-Mar-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	1) There is no plan to cut technicians or to not support them. As you see taxation is slightly higher for them, but thats it. Feel encouraged to add technicians


[06-Mar-24 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	2) I had a look to Popi numbers and support infrastructure. We have an unemployement for technicians.


[06-Mar-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Would say about 100 technicians. Technician happiness is limited by comfort. But supply and happiness and overall popi figures look welll for me


[06-Mar-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You should get your workforce - once added - latest with the next workforce redistribution.


[06-Mar-24 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	If there is demand for even more technicians other comfort infrastructure may be added. Inwould jeep an eye on that

[25-Apr-24 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tarvos**:	prob the slider thing and it only took 2 mins to correct i doubt it had any impact. Thanks for making sure I have enough workers btw. I'll be expanding to a new planet soon already made a CM kit for it.

[14-May-24 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-May-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Candor**:	Though double-check the contract before you do it. Don't do what I did yesterday and do something daft like put up goods for 1/10 of their value, lol

**Aufricer**:	Hi. You probably realized, that I tested some of thr new functionality of the gov system


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	yes


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	As expected  from all the notes and infos available before that update: It will be harder/more complicated to govern a planet


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Currently there is 0 cash in the gov balance (dont know if everybody can see it or not)


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	So payout is not possible (fullfill button not available)


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also I am looking for a volunteer to test a delivery vs. Payout contract or something like that. Just DM me ingame

***Trapper69** deleted this message.*


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Well: In general as government  you can recieve cash and pay out cash (only whats in the account)


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also a change of taxation level of Popi etc. is still possible. Also its possible to combine those activities in one "vote"


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For you fellow capitalists nothing must change.


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You can still fill the POPI by donation. In case you like to provide cash for the nemesis account you need to contact your government (me).


[26-Jun-24 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpium**:	That last motion... does that mean for a new base you have to pay a fee? If you expand would there be a fee too?


[26-Jun-24 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I guess its for new bases only. Just discovered it in the available votes. Have to read in the dev notes


[26-Jun-24 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also I believe, that the programs (e.g. festivals) would only start if there is enough cash in the gov account. Thus someone need to contribute or tax income must be sufficient

[26-Jun-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	There is a small bug or something. In the financial menu of thr gov I see current tranaactions. Now its only 4 of them 3 x fee payment and 1 x base establishement fee


[26-Jun-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	It seems the fee is incorrectly  0 and Indoubt that with so many players only 3 productions finished (2 of them are from my own base). But anyhow good news is - governemnt earned 42 CIS so far


[26-Jun-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	is there a way to donate?


[26-Jun-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Trapper69**:	i cant find it if there is


[26-Jun-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

Release Notes - Realpolitik
I just tested this locally and remembered there is one more rule: The first base is exempt from any base establishment fee no matter where it is established. Most likely it was a new player that joined your planet.   Starting planets cannot have base establishment fees. I added a note to create a local rules wiki article for the handbook explain...

[27-Jun-24 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In the end not to many things will change with new system.


[27-Jun-24 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The good thing is, everybody can get rid off the cooperations created only for governments and there is a small benefit in overview (e.g. I see that 2 x new bases are found)


[27-Jun-24 05:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	That said: I dont see a need for changing rules or taxes on NEM at the moment. My guess is, that after the first 1 or 2 election terms interesst in governing a planet will go back again. Good thing is a player is not limited to 1 administrative post anymore. So we may see a handfull of players actively managing cluster of planets

[30-Jun-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Not sure if companies have 69 in store or they would need to bring them in. But if you go for smaller adds of about 10 BSE you could maybe secure yourself a few. That said: Sorry I have 0 on stock

[03-Jul-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I realized, we charged the first base establishement fee


[03-Jul-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jul-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

Coming back to that  At least one company paid a base establishement fee, while the majority did not.    If that company replies to me I can or can not confirm if it was an established player.

[03-Jul-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**BlueHeeler**:	What was the fee 7 days ago?


[04-Jul-24 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@okie - degration works with ticks. There is a lot of discussion (check general chat or one of the discords). Some people say repair at 70d most at 90d. However after 90d you will realize that condition can drop from 90 % towards 50 % rather fast


[04-Jul-24 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	building condition is a base in the whole multiplication (formular is in handbook). So its more critical to have a condition of 80 % as 80 % workforce.


[04-Jul-24 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@all I will monitor whats wrong with the warehouse fees. From those 2 that replied + my own fee payment alone we should have earned more as is stated in the balance. On the other hand maybe they still went to the Cooperation insteadt of the government

[09-Jul-24 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlueHeeler**:	When repairing it is always wise to check before you head out in your ship and/or take a few extra. If you do the repair from Buildings instead of the Building Repair Assistant you should be able to repair some until you run out of MCG assuming you have a number of repairs to make. I often have this happen in spite of the recommendations that I gave you. But I also just forget to bring stuff. It is part of the game.

**Dlrow**:	One way of finding out is config any planet on PRUNplanner and add single BMP, since BMP needs 100 pioneers simple divide the daily I/O by 100.


[04-Aug-24 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dlrow**:	In which turn out to be RAT-0.04 / DW-0.04 / OVE-0.005


[04-Aug-24 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Weaver42**:	Wait, are we talking drinking water or regular water?


[07-Aug-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sisso**:	regular water, 2 players monopolize every CTX with buy and selling prices. Probably the only way to break them is to produce soo much water they will be wasting money buying everything from everybody


[07-Aug-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Weaver42**:	or to starve them out by only buying from local markets.


[07-Aug-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sisso**:	I think that is hard, create contracts take time, need special account, etc... Just build bases to sell water generate extra $$$


[07-Aug-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sisso**:	and... they have no cost to maitain the order once is already stabilized... so overproducing water and make them pay all the water in the world probably is the only way to cause the idea to breaks


[07-Aug-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Weaver42**:	the thing is, CXL always requires fuel to reach it. If you sell on local markets, people on the planet can buy directly from you without the need for fuel. This means you can sell for prices lower than the CXL and because you don't have to worry about fuel costs you make more of a profit.


[07-Aug-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Weaver42**:	That's not even assuming people would be willing to travel to you to buy at a lower price. Though admittedly it's difficult to see who sells what. I kind of wish there was an 'advertise' option at the CXL to show where you are, and what people can buy from you.


[07-Aug-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Weaver42**:	ok, I can't manage to get it above 100t. However I also managed to get additional items that won't put it over 24t. I will spread the payments for each shipping order based on priority. Is that ok? It will overall equal 200 in payment.

[15-Aug-24 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	would be good to discuss motions more, I would strongly be in favor of doing 0% interest loans from tax money for new players if that is possible


[15-Aug-24 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	there was also a recent discussion about base establishment fees. Those were introduced by Aufricer even though Nemesis is a starter planet. The discussion made it to a forum post where the game design team said the fee should be zero as Nemesis is a starting planet; they said "Starting planets cannot have base establishment fees. I added a note to create a local rules wiki article for the handbook explaining the mechanic."


[15-Aug-24 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	I also do not see the point in taxing players for establishing bases, so I would motion to remove the tax


[15-Aug-24 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	The planet is quite saturated already, so it would not create a tax deficit


[15-Aug-24 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	Worst case scenario it would be 200k deficit, which is only a quarter of the last tax payout, and allowing people to establish bases is much more profitable in the long run


[15-Aug-24 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	But that scenerio is highly unrealistic as there are also excemptions for new players, so only people who build a second base here would be taxed personally as far as I understand from the discussion; even more reason to remove it


[15-Aug-24 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dlrow**:	As the founder of a company established here, I greatly respect Aufricer for contributing most of the upkeep supplies for COGC and infrastructure, where I believe most of the payout tax go to. I agree more discussion is needed, and regarding base establishment fees, Nemesis is a very attractive agriculture planet, so a lot of companies setup here. For them it would be one of their many bases, only a one time fee and most likely an insignificant amount, so I doubt the fee will deter them. While for starting player the first base is exempt from any base establishment fee no matter where it is established. In my opinion, the fee serves as a good source of government income without any burden to established players.


[15-Aug-24 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	That clears things up as far as the tax part goes, good to have it confirmed that starting players are exempt from any base establishment fee, even if they are set. It was my main concern that would not be the case, and new players would be taxed, and indeed I also doubt that the fee will deter players looking for a second base.


[15-Aug-24 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MeltingSilicon**:	As for the upkeep for CoGC it has been managed well, the upkeep for the next cycle is already supplied. Good to have the agricultural programs, I also intend to continue those.


[15-Aug-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XaRdAx**:	I have a question to that upkeep. The tax payout happens since term #36. Does nemesis didnt had an upkeep before that? I highly doubt that.


[15-Aug-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XaRdAx**:	I indeed saw hes doing upkeep. But in high of the tax payout? Also to be doubt.


[15-Aug-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XaRdAx**:	Do things more transparent do avoid such discussions


[15-Aug-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XaRdAx**:	Also still doesnt said a word by himself. That is what honestly tell me the most. He had the time to declare candidacy but not the time so say a word to the tax payout? Sry thats not good.

[15-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Hi everybody,  so the current population report just came out.  Pioneer reserve is a bit low, thats why we will push the POPI a bit for security.   For all the questions raised on NEM chat.   The governor is or at least was supposed to provide the upkeep of a planet.  A task nobody liked and historicaly players with deeper pockets only had been  viable to do. Its a job that comes with some kind of micromanagement, extra transport and  in most cases brings you a deficit.   As with many planets for NEM nobody liked to take over the job.  If you look back in history the tax income never was enough to saturate the costs that occure. As someone mentioned you can grab the planet chats with one of the FIO websites or tools.  If you look back I had explained from time to time the current tax income and costs.   Before that last major update tax went to the cooperation. That stopped a few weeks ago, while the production fees still flew until 2 or 3 weeks ago.


[15-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In other words the fees are only due once a production finsihed or it was cancelled.   In 07/2023 I changed the flat taxation of NEM to the structure we have now. I adjusted them in about  02/2024.  The taxation is and was still very low compared to other big planets.  It shall encourage agri and food with a small encouragement towards chemistry (for agri support).  Ressource extraction is to bring in at least some tax. Tax should discourage all other kind of business but not punish it to much.  We never had engineers or scientist, so no need to set a taxation.


[15-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also a lot of players helped and donated stuff to POPI for a long time.  Thats why tax was 50% of what it is now. Until recently the zoo was taken care of as well as the art gallery. Gallery provides culture. I checked the handbook and thats for engineers.  The other POPI infrastructure was set to the levels they are at the moment a long time ago. From experience those levels are sufficient to keep the population happy.   a player contacted me some time ago - saying he will sack a lot of technicians. So no need to feed the zoo that much anymore.


[15-Aug-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	as far as I know NEM is one of few or only planet to have an emerency center and a hospital.  I donated those buildings long ago.   As a reference from checking the values. One level of one POPI input for Security Drone Post is worth  3 x the input for one level of input for the Safety station.  In other words water for safety station level 3 brings as much as POW for the security drone post.  Unfortuately the values for the emergency center are much more worse.   From here you can do your own math or consultate the game geeks and there sheets.


[15-Aug-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For NEM currently it is good to fullfill the Safety station at level 4 and the Infirmery at level 2 on top of that the zoo at level 2 should be feed with two inputs.  Thats for the POPI. Also the COCG needs attention.   Currently thats 465 DW; 620 MCG; 620 PE and 310 RAT each 10 days.  So in total 1.395 DW; 1860 MCG and PE and 930 RAT in one election cycle.  After a long time I filled one of my excels and thats - with current prices you should expect to pay for the safety station in 28 days.  For DW: 157.000; For OFF 112.000; For SUN 158.000;   For infirmery its (in 28d) For OFF: 56.000; For TUB: 159.600; For STR:  129.000;


[15-Aug-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The COCG would be   117.000 + 61.500 + 17.000 + 121.000 = 316.500   The ZOO is about  SOI -> 144.000  DW  ->  84.000  FOD -> 168.000 PFE -> 140.000 DEC -> 594.000  Lets say 2 of them -> 228.000   Add some extra for the Emergency center/Security drone post + currency fluctuation. And transport.   Its OK to say that the costs can be estimated to: 1.316.000 -> 1.350.000 against that stands an income from taxes, fees (yes even base establishement fees) of about 330.000 each 7 days.  Thats 30.000 more per week as it was 2 months before and adds up to approx. 1.320.000


[15-Aug-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	The base establishement fee was only 1.500 during the last 3 weeks or so. Someone that can create a 2nd or 17th base is able to pay 1.500.  I had a discussion with molp about that, as that change was not mentioned in the initial release notes, nor did molp know how the fees work.  It turned out, that only from 2nd bases on those fees need to be paid.   With the taxation balancing out the costs (more costs exceeding taxation) there is no buffer for programs or the  stargates announced recently.   A new parliament therefore would be wise to   a) increase tax*1 b) try to get the input for Popi and COCG for less c) best provided by a player   *1 2 players approached me for donating to the government but for different reasons it never happened.

[23-Dec-24 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	that's what I do, anytime I post a vote I throw a message in Gov chat - notifications are easy to miss at the bottom of the page

[23-Dec-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	In the end 1 vote (1 voter) is enough. Just you have to wait 24h


[23-Dec-24 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	exactly....or folks that sign up to work in parliament could represent and participate in discussions, planning and votes and things could move more quickly....votes will auto-complete after 24h, but will also complete when everyone has voted


[23-Dec-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I guess there's really no incentive though.


[23-Dec-24 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	typically there really isnt much to talk about people got this down pretty pack. 99% of people just want the Cogc upkept low taxes and to not lose workforce.


[23-Dec-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stbadreturns**:	the day the attach workforce happiness to production output then.. it might get intresting


[23-Dec-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I realize there isn't much to do, or even to talk about (though there are multiple ways to skin the same cat, and folks may want to try a different, more cost-efficient method).....but my point is two-fold, 1) we've all seen what happens when an active governor drops and others are idling in office barely keeping the seats warm in recent history, and secondly (less important), nobody likes to be the only guy in the room working.


[23-Dec-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the system went from rule by one guy to rule by committee, but it's still just one guy doing the work - everyone else is just adding another LEAD notch.


[23-Dec-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	all to say really, I don't support the public call-outs, but I totally understand the sentiment.


[23-Dec-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	guess i never figure to post in Gov chat since people aren't seeing vote notifications that popup the same


[23-Dec-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And I wasn't blasting anybody....just figured people see this and don't go to Gov screen, at least my notifications for planets that I have a base popup for me


[23-Dec-24 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	It is way easier on small planets with just one person....but some larger planets I am getting votes in less than 24 hours :)


[23-Dec-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	right now is holiday time...so not unexpected to have breaks


[23-Dec-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shadowz121**:	I used to vote, just saying :)


[23-Dec-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	NOTS are easy to miss - you have to move the bfr to the top of the page, then scroll to check them.....then yeah, switch contexts - it's a conscious effort.


[23-Dec-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**R.Hess**:	As a pleb voter, I just want to see the people that run for the office participate in the governance.  Last term the two-member parlement only managed a 35% voting rate.  So far this term it is looking worse.  I can not see voting for someone a second time that did not show up for the process the first time around.  Last thing we need is Govenor burnout and disengagement from beating his/her head into the wall alone.


[23-Dec-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	The voting public can see who is/is not voting/participating within the government - motion votes are publicly viewable on all planets GOV page (live as they're happening) - not so much for discussions, though many of the gov chats are fairly quiet (except where the gov likes to talk to the wall).


[23-Dec-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I am confused....how can the public see parliament stuff?


[23-Dec-24 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	I understand the motions but discussions?


[23-Dec-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And does anybody look at the motions....


[23-Dec-24 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	And how much of the time people actually vote...not just here but lots of planets


[23-Dec-24 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**R.Hess**:	There are 147 occupied plots here and 17 people voted in the last election.  Not a real great turnout, less than 12%


[23-Dec-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**R.Hess**:	I look at the motions just to see who is voting.  It is, the only way I can judge who is participating in the government.  I am sure I am a tiny minority of the small numbers that even vote


[23-Dec-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	Glad you look.  It makes being on parliament a more enjoyable thing when people participate, even question why am I doing something


[23-Dec-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	It doesn't make a huge difference when people don't vote as 24 hours isn't a big deal....but it just feels worse with no participation


[23-Dec-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	But parliament isn't for everyone, I enjoy it or I wouldn't be on 13 parliaments :)


[24-Dec-24 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I look, but nobody cares - folks vote for their corp mates or someone they've had pleasant interactions with before, they don't vote for candidates based on the facts of parliamentary behavior. I did not say they can see gov chat - in fact I acknowledged quite the opposite...but if they're not showing up to vote, they're not likely discussing anything either.

**Aufricer**:	Obviously your company did.not get deleted. How long habe you stayed offline ? Did you log in from time to time ? How did the restart went ? Everything still in store or did you bought everything from CX with deep pockets?


[27-Dec-24 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And: Great to help the newer players


[28-Dec-24 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	i did log in every time i got the deletion email and it's been about 700 days i think. I was pretty self sufficient, so i had a lot already in store for the restart. only had to buy a bit of DW and RAT and some BSE to be able to repair everything. but it was done after 3-4 days and now i am up and running with 10 bases again.

**farfenkugel**:	Can government purchase required materials for the upkeep? Or how does that work?


[16-Apr-25 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes, the government (on larger planets) generally pays for the mats (through reimbursement, payouts)....generally the governor or PM's provide the mats.


[16-Apr-25 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TAfirehawk**:	It is indirect for the mats as anybody can contribute and the government can do a payout to anybody...but 2 independent things as the Gov doesn't buy mats.
