[03-Feb-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Update on QJ-650c: Our transition to chemistry has brought a big influx of new players, and it's significantly increased the population of higher tier workers. Our settler count has tripled and technicians and engineers are on a steep rise. We've got 550 technicans and 400 open jobs. Midas is transitioning to a high tier workforce planet. Today I've got a ship departing with 400k AIC of upkeep items.   I've been chatting with Yuen and Melon164 about ways to support the planet as it grows, and they've both been very generous, launching a lovely Art Gallery and covering immigration programs.  Planetary Festivals are normally a great way to cheaply keep the happiness up, but if we want to grow higher tier populations, immigration programs are necessary instead. So that means more of the burden falls on upkeep items. I'll be raising the taxes in the next few days. It will never cover the costs of the planet, but it should soften the blow a bit.

**Archiel**:	Another INF is coming and POPI will be intensively filled tomorrow. I've been notified of some new bases opening with high scientist and engineer counts. Since Scientist growth is naturally pretty low here, we will need to rely on immigration projects for it, so I'll be pumping up POPI upkeep to match.


[06-Sep-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I was informed our planet has one of the higher active scientist counts in ANT space, and the planet has grown a lot since I started


[06-Sep-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	We'll keep it up, as it remains a great choice for high tier workers in Chemistry

**Churaviis**:	We tried to name this planet Midas but there was already a player with that exact name


[07-Sep-23 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Archiel**:	A lot of the growth isn't even OOG members!


[07-Sep-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lukeskye**:	I am interested. What would would be the time commitment per week?


[07-Feb-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	By the way, I just read through your good governance sheet. Quite detailed.


[07-Feb-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Awesome. Really it isn't too bad from a time perspective. A few hours the first few weeks to get a handle on it, then it's just a matter of remembering to fill COGC and POPI


[07-Feb-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Feel free to press RUN in the race and I'll withdraw and I'll vote for you


[07-Feb-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Okay, I will run.


[07-Feb-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	woo!


[07-Feb-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Okay I've withdrawn, and Lukeskye has my endorsement


[07-Feb-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Once you confirm that you've set a calendar reminder to take care of the COGC and upkeep, you'll have my vote


[07-Feb-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I've set a weekly reminder.


[07-Feb-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Thanks for the endorsement, Archiel. I see that some materials are present in the population infrastructure upkeep and some are not. Would you recommend to keep only using these materials?


[07-Feb-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	you generally only need to feed 1/3rd of POPI. OFF and UTS are usually the cheapest options, but knowing the answer to your question is precisely what Archiels governor helper sheet is built to do


[07-Feb-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Yep, you'll want to fill out the sheet. I do make some choices based on things that I make at lower than market cost


[07-Feb-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	and the needs do fluctuate a bit, so you'll change occasionally to match.


[07-Feb-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Like someone did reach out that they were adding a base of Techs this week, so that'll be something to watch


[07-Feb-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Okay. It says aim above 70%, is that for projected true happiness, or happiness with full employment?


[07-Feb-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I think if a category has high unemployment, you don't need to grow it, so those can be under 70%. But growth is calculated with the final number, not the one labeled "with full employment"


[07-Feb-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	It's broken out separately because unemployment can have a pretty drastic effect on the happiness, and it can also swing if people are adding big bases


[07-Feb-24 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I had been shrinking the settler and pioneer count the last few reports since they got pretty high, but I had already started a festivity 3 so that bumps them all up across the board


[07-Feb-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Since technician immigration is only 100 techs and with a festival we'll get at least 200

**lukeskye**:	Hello all, after governing for a couple weeks, I have found that taxes only account for about a fifth of material upkeep costs. Therefore, I propose that taxes be raised. My plan would triple (3x) the rates of pioneer, settler, and technician taxes, and leave engineer and scientist rates unchanged. This will also make the taxes more proportional, according to the 'cost per 100 workers' section of Archiel's spreadsheet. I will allow one week for discussion and financial planning (for anyone who takes taxes into account) before implementing these changes. - Luke


[18-Feb-24 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i'm all for it!


[18-Feb-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Great. I am also considering adding a second art gallery. The theme would be 'larger than life'. All types of artwork would be accepted, the only condition being that the surface area of the artwork is larger than the surface area of the average adult human. There would of course be an exhibit dedicated to the song by the Backstreet Boys of the same name.


[18-Feb-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I think 3x is probably too much considering what it should probably cost, but I think an increase is probably in order. I'm curious what your calculations for cost are based on. I plopped the current POPI numbers into the sheet and it suggests to me that POPI is currently overfed and could do with a pretty significant cut back given current unemployment levels (which are quite high for PIO and SET)


[18-Feb-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I am looking to keep unemployment high to encourage new arrivals.


[18-Feb-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	keeping happiness as high as it currently is will be increasingly expensive as unemployment increases, which is kind of my point


[18-Feb-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	it makes sense that the numbers suggest you need to triple taxes to pay for that, but it seems like a pretty big waste imo that's all


[18-Feb-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	like the happiness for all pops before unemployment is nearly 100%, that's really high, way higher than you usually need unless you are deliberately trying to grow pop because it's too low. This would be fine if it was low, but it's currently actually really high and should probably be either kept steady or reduced


[18-Feb-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	for a concrete example: it seems like you can achieve big positive migration still by reducing SST to just DW and OFF, INF to just OFF, and running festivities 3. This is nearly 100k/w cheaper than fully feeding both even after the 30k the festivities program will cost. You can save another 80k by not feeding the LIB with MHP (which suggests you don't need to upgrade the ART, either)


[18-Feb-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	to be clear: I support increasing taxes to whatever you need to break even, my point is just that tripling seems far too high. It would make Elon the highest tax planet I've settled by a large margin which suggests some likely inefficieny :)


[18-Feb-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Is the festival bonus 20% increase on current happiness or does it literally add 20% to happiness?


[18-Feb-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	archiel's sheet lets you simulate it, select festival in the top right. Looks to me like it's a straight +20% and it only costs 28k/w


[18-Feb-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Thanks, I see it now. That is a really big bonus. It seems to depend on the population, it is 47k for me.


[18-Feb-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	ah ok, that makes sense that it depends on pop, I checked aceland as that's where I'm gov and it's about a third the pop of elon. Interesting that it's not even a linear increase in cost


[18-Feb-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, looks like the festivities would save around 150k / week while still attracting high-skill migrants.


[18-Feb-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	the other thing I would say is if you study the tax rates of other planets, a common pattern is that they are much more progressive than the defaults, with PIO and SET being fairly low, TEC being a few multiples higher, and then ENG being a few multiples higher again


[18-Feb-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	with elon's pop distribution, you can probably significantly increase total tax revenue by leaving PIO/SET approximately where they are (maybe a small increase, like 25% or so), and doubling both TEC and ENG


[18-Feb-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	higher tier pops are so expensive anyway (a full ENG base is normally in the order of 3-5m per 180d) and the products from them have higher margins


[18-Feb-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Good point, I think I will increase all of them.


[18-Feb-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	By my calculation, a  full new base wouldn't be more than one or two percentages of the total population, meaning we don't need to maintain such a high unemployment rate just to be ready for new bases. The upkeep is higher than it needs to be and much of the happiness or would produce is being eaten up by unemployment. I would prefer to try lowering upkeep before we raise taxes or build new infrastructure.


[18-Feb-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Which kind of new base? A full set of labs is 800-900 techs, which is about 20% of the current population.


[18-Feb-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	With Roganartu's suggestion for regular festivities, the current settler and pioneer numbers can be kept steady while also attracting more techs, engineers, and scientists.


[18-Feb-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I will put the plans for the new art gallery on pause, now that I know the power of festivities.


[18-Feb-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	But I still believe in keeping plenty of high skilled workers around.


[18-Feb-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	53 bases, around 240k / week planned increase in taxes, gives an average of roughly 5k per week of extra taxes per company. My PG base is estimated at around 1200k profit / week. So the new taxes would reduce my profits by about .4%. Seems like a worthwhile sacrifice to grow the economy of the planet.


[18-Feb-24 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I think the final sentence is the crux of the contention here. I disagree that it grows the economy of the planet at all, I think it's largely just waste


[18-Feb-24 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	an important mechanic that may be being missed here is that the higher unemployment gets, the lower happiness becomes. The equilibrium happiness for a planet is somewhere between 60-70%, and the equilibrium unemployment in my experience tends to end up hovering around 10-20% or so. It can be valuable to push this number higher when you are expecting actual concrete new settlement (like people with a plan have explicitly reached out and plan to settle more than the pop you currently have available), but short of that pushing happiness higher to get higher unemployment numbers just in case is wasteful


[18-Feb-24 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	so if you spend a bunch of money pushing pop up such that unemployment becomes, I dunno, 20% for ENG (which imo would be unnecessarily high), if nobody comes along to actually employ them you will either have to keep paying otherwise-unnecessary upkeep to keep them around, or they will migrate away and the money spent to get them was then wasted


[18-Feb-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	It's nice when people reach out ahead of time, but sometimes people want more flexibility. They might be reacting to a shift in the market and waiting a week or two for the workers would make a big difference.


[18-Feb-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	What levels of unemployment would you suggest? You said equilibrium tends to be 10-20%, I am aiming for the higher end of that for higher skill workers.


[18-Feb-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Additionally, once the unemployment gets to our target, then the happiness can be cut back to 50% until more immigrants are needed.


[18-Feb-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	This reduces the long-term cost of maintaining higher unemployement.


[18-Feb-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	You also disagree that it grows the economy. By 'it' I am assuming that you mean unemployment. I do believe that it would grow the economy by making it more attractive for newcomers. More companies means more frequent shipping, more production, more opportunities for trade.


[18-Feb-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	you can't cut the happiness to 50%, that's not really how it works


[18-Feb-24 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	lots of things contribute to happiness, not just POPI satisfaction but also unemployment


[18-Feb-24 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	the higher unemployment gets, the more downward pressure on happiness there is. Inversely, open jobs applies upwards pressure on happiness


[18-Feb-24 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	generally speaking, 70% is neutral migration, under 70% is negative migration, and over 70% is positive migration


[18-Feb-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	this is what I was saying before, it's just wasteful no matter what you do. Spend a bunch now to get a bunch of unused pop, this costs a lot of money. Now you have a bunch of unemployed pop you need to continue paying to maintain


[18-Feb-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	waiting 2-3 weeks to get high end pop is totally expected. Everyone who builds an ENG building knows and expects this

[18-Feb-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	This page says under 50% is negative migration.


[18-Feb-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	On the governor sheet, even when I override the happiness to 0%, there's still no emigration.


[18-Feb-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	migration is calculated on a rolling 5 week average of happiness, the sheet doesn't reflect it perfectly for this reason. Happiness could go to 0 this week and you'd still have positive migration for probably the next two weeks


[18-Feb-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	look, you seem pretty gung ho on this and I'm not really that interested in fighting about it. I've said my peace, if you really want to jack taxes here up that high I mean it's your perogative


[18-Feb-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Were we fighting about it? I thought we were having a friendly discussion about the proposal.


[18-Feb-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I understand that migration is calculated over multiple weeks, I was referring to the handbook page that says the emigration threshold is 50%, whereas you said 70%. Trying to understand which is correct. The page says it's a 'legacy tutorial' so maybe you have more recent info.


[18-Feb-24 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	if you scroll back through the POPI for fk-794d, you'll see in report #18 it has negative migration at 60% after weeks of large positive migration. The only real change? unemployment went over 20%


[18-Feb-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	it continues for a bit, though that was a separate issue (POPI wasn't being fed at some point, which let it drop below 50%), which is why the migration didn't stop dropping despite unemployment getting lower


[18-Feb-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	honestly my main confusion here is why you want to get unemployment so high, especially for such expensive pops as TEC and ENG


[18-Feb-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	look at griffonstone for a good example of a more popular planet. It had negative TEC migration this week, unemployment ticked over 20% and they lost nearly 1300 techs. If you look at their POPI upkeep contributions, they're spending less than you are planning to and have 3x the pop


[18-Feb-24 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I've looked at both, and noticed that in all cases of emigration the happiness went below 50%.


[18-Feb-24 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	The discrepancy in the governor sheet is not explained by your statement either, since when the happiness is overridden at 0, immigration drops to 0, whereas you said it would not drop to zero immediately.


[18-Feb-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I said probably, in reality going directly to zero happiness isn't going to happen, and also the gov sheet is a lot of guessing. It's extremely useful, but it's not gospel


[18-Feb-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	broadly my point is: governing isn't that hard. For the most part, you can leave everything alone and feed 1/3rd of POPI, with very occasional adjustments based on observed trends and continued estimations/observations using the sheet


[18-Feb-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Well, with the assumption that the population can be maintained at 50%, it seems that doubling, instead of tripling, the tax rate will be sufficient.


[18-Feb-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I still think that having extra high-skilled workers to attract newcomers justifies the cost to maintain them, though I haven't done an exact analysis.


[18-Feb-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	let's run some numbers: there are 1081 engineers now, with 10.2% unemployed. This means there's 110 unemployed. To get to 20%, you need to add 90-100, which will probably take 3 weeks of 75%+ happiness and there'll be... less than one base worth of engineers available for these "newcomers"


[18-Feb-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	is that really going to attract anyone?


[18-Feb-24 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Why newcomers in quotes?


[18-Feb-24 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	have you got an ENG base, out of curiosity? or TEC? are you familiar with how one normally approaches setting up those buildings?


[18-Feb-24 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	No.


[18-Feb-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Anyways, I tested the difference between 10 and 20% unemployment in the spreadsheet. To maintain 20% instead of 10%, the difference is bridged simply by supplying 50 DW / Day to the Park. Divide that by 50 bases, and that means each person would be paying 1 DW per day to maintain the extra 400 techs, 100 engineers, and 25 scientists.


[18-Feb-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	If my work and the spreadsheet's estimate are accurate, I would assume 1 DW per day is not too much to ask.


[18-Feb-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	how do you reconcile that logic with the claim that taxes need to be tripled (or even doubled)?


[18-Feb-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Based on the numbers. I received 134k in taxes this week, the spreadsheet is showing 300k in mats, plus the 50k for festivities, which appears to be more efficient than mats.


[18-Feb-24 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	That is a bit less than triple, so I think double will be sufficient for now.


[18-Feb-24 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	My original estimate was made based on 700k, before I learned of festivities and maintenance rate of 50% happiness.


[19-Feb-24 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I don't believe that (m)any players will think "I wonder where I should put my next base, I know, let's look for planets with lots of unemployment".  Lack of workers is a malus like higher-tier building mats in that it diminishes your initial profitability, sure, but no more than that.


[19-Feb-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	The planet will get a bad rep if you persistently fail to accommodate the needs of existing bases, or fail to meet a clear trend of upwards growth.  But unemployed pop for the sake of unemployed pop is extravagant and won't attract anyone, IMO


[19-Feb-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Hello Melon, thanks for the feedback.


[19-Feb-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Let's look at an example. A base with all labs could potentially do a few hundred thousand profit per week. Missing 400 techs would cut about 1/3 of that. Assuming that my calculation on the upkeep costs was correct, their 700 / week extra in taxes would only surpass the 100k saved after a bit less than 3 years.


[19-Feb-24 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	For some people, this extra production doesn't matter much. But others are looking to respond to certain conditions that require quick action.


[19-Feb-24 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	For example, if a good suddenly doubled in price, or a corporation had a new source of demand to fill.


[19-Feb-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Not sure why the need to increase taxes to maintain almost 7k unemployed PIO and 5k unemployed SET's.  Increasing taxes on the bases with only PIO or SET's to increase the TEC+ unemployment pools seems abit lopsided.  And then it begs the question to what extent of unemployment for them will PIO & SET have to pay for?


[19-Feb-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Obviously gunna have some disgruntled folk here, as the comments so far are forcasting.


[19-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Hello TuffyLess, thanks for the feedback. In short, my revised plan is to raise taxes for all, not just pioneers and settlers. My current target unemployment is 20%, which will cost an extra 700/week/base avg. If you look back at the chat history, you will find some more info.


[19-Feb-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	This is according to the spreadsheet, which may not be entirely accurate. So it would be a sort of experiment.


[19-Feb-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Doubling taxes would make the lower three equivalent to griffonstone, and the upper two would be a bit higher.


[19-Feb-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	20% of 26.2k is 5.2k unemployed PIO's.  And 4.8k unemployed SET's.


[19-Feb-24 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	That doesnt seem like ... super-excessive?


[19-Feb-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	According to my estimate, the cost of such maintenance, vs 10%, appears to be 700 / week / base, which does not seem excessive to me.


[19-Feb-24 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I don't know if it would even be possible to reduce the population of settlers and pioneers without losing higher tier workers.


[19-Feb-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I said excessive in context of the % of maintained unemployment.  I mean, how many pop do you think a PIO base of 500 area consumes?


[19-Feb-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I know that the PIO and SET are unnecessarily high. It's a side effect of maintaining the others.


[19-Feb-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	And doubling the taxes means you'll be charging more than Griff.  PIO taxes for Chem on Griff are 20 AIC.  You're gunna tax Elon at 30 AIC for Chem?


[19-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Where are you seeing 20? I see 30.


[19-Feb-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	LR LS-300c


[19-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, it says 30 for me.


[19-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	You see 30 for Chem PIO's there?


[19-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Ah, my mistake, I was looking at the wrong row.


[19-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	How about SET's?  You see 50 for Chem?


[19-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	yeh


[19-Feb-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	And Elon is 1/3 of the pop of Griff to boot.


[19-Feb-24 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I dunno man, you took Gov so you do you.  Elections are regular.


[19-Feb-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I would think Education programs would help promote the pop upward in tiers?


[19-Feb-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I personally would like to see Elon become a Manufacturing CoGC but Im sure that aint gunna fly w/ anyone here lol :)


[19-Feb-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Why make it manufacturing?


[19-Feb-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	MG -> PG -> PPF & WPL's.


[19-Feb-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	but straight PG is a better winner for many I suspect


[19-Feb-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	ohh, BMP too


[19-Feb-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Example since I already have C & H here for PG, am also using BMP's to make PE as well, despite taking the CoGC hit for the PE.


[19-Feb-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Why would you make PE here instead of a planet that already has a manufacturing bonus?


[19-Feb-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	permits.  can never get enough


[19-Feb-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	and already have 1000's of C & H here


[19-Feb-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	And why not buy it on the CX? Prices outside of AI look reasonable.


[19-Feb-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	still have to buy on CX


[19-Feb-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Well anyways, I think QJ-382a is a good candidate for manufacturing MG, although I haven't compared processing it onworld or offworld.


[19-Feb-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	but that's why anyways.  More permits will change my config here, when that day finally comes.


[19-Feb-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	About the taxes for Chem, Im not necessarily against them being raised if for good promotional reason but simply to do to have 1000's and 1000's and 1000's and 1000's of unemployed peepz makes no sense and is a waste IMO


[19-Feb-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	and Educational programs will help alleviate the excessive unemployment at the lower tier and help to increase the higher tiers.?.  No?


[19-Feb-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	The main reason for raising them was to cover existing costs. The extra unemployment was for the upper tiers, and would be a minor fraction of the total upkeep.


[19-Feb-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Educational programs would help, but they would take the place of festivities, which appears to save a significant amount of upkeep.


[19-Feb-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	are you buying popi upkeep mats from the CX?


[19-Feb-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	On a separate note, I looked into MG processing at QJ-382a with prunplanner and it does appear quite profitable, if there is enough demand.


[19-Feb-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	@roganartu yes, some from the CX.


[19-Feb-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I would recommend finding a way to avoid that. Most govs either make their own upkeep goods or buy them off CX for much cheaper, would likely cut your project costs significantly


[19-Feb-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I would personally be very surprised if Elon costs more than 200k/w to maintain tbh


[19-Feb-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, through trail and error, I've gotten the nominal cost to maintain 50% happiness down to that number, only buying HD from the CX.


[19-Feb-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	*trial


[19-Feb-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	For times when more population is needed, it will of course be higher.


[19-Feb-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	not really, honestly. When more pop is needed there will be upwards pressure on happiness from lower unemployment. The only things that really increase maintenance costs are increased POPI satisfaction needs and increased cogc costs, neither of which are really transient


[19-Feb-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	anyway it seems at this point that the conclusion is “taxes don’t even need to double”, is that accurate? Increase sure, but more like 25-50% which is much more reasonable (and probably not across the board either, at least I wouldn’t)


[19-Feb-24 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I'm thinking 75% as of now.


[19-Feb-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	And to your point about the unemployment, at maintenance levels of 50% satisfaction, even with the assumption of 20% unemployment that many have objected to, happiness would still only be 70% at 0 unemployment, requiring further contributions for more workers.


[19-Feb-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	no it wouldn’t, low unemployment gives a big happiness boost that is not really accounted for perfectly in the sheet, especially open jobs


[19-Feb-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	this mechanic is why equilibrium tends to be somewhere around 10% unemployment or so. Low unemployment gives a happiness boost, open jobs gives a bigger one, high unemployment reduces happiness


[19-Feb-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	this is also why, for most planets, you just have to feed 1/3rd of popi or so, the whole system kind of just finds equilibrium itself over time. It only becomes expensive when you try to force it


[19-Feb-24 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Rune-Cailliau** left.*


[19-Feb-24 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hey Luke, I have not read the thesis written above and have notice the discussion here by chance. But the gist I read at the start is that youwanted to raise taxes as the current tax scheme only covers 1/5th of the costs, i believe I read.


[19-Feb-24 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I would merely echo what I think Archiel say previously, and im sure others. My Recommendation is to only put in the cheapest inputs for SST and INF


[19-Feb-24 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, however, I was informed of / figured out several ways to cut costs, so now it's around 1/2 or a bit more.


[19-Feb-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Dope. That is the move, 100%. Tax rates look pretty reasonable to me, but depending on your costs, a Bump could be needed. I'm sure you could look at any of the 6+ planets I run for examples of tax rates. But the sum of what I wanted to say is...


[19-Feb-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	each level of a infrastructure building has a set output of "fulfillment" of a resource like "health". SST for example outputs 1500 "Safety" points. Population use that poinfts of fulfillment, and depending on the quota used, generate a "happiness" %


[19-Feb-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If a building like the SST have 3 inputs, each input contributes 1/3rd of the total 1500 points


[19-Feb-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Okay. Is the negative migration only happens at below 50%?


[19-Feb-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So say you have a level 1 SST, and fill it with only OFF


[19-Feb-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	*I meant to ask is the legacy tutorial correct where it says this.


[19-Feb-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That generates 1500/3,  aka 500 points of safety fulfillment


[19-Feb-24 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Sure.


[19-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you want more fulfillment, you can either use DW or SUN to now get 1500*2/3 fulfillment OR, upgrade the SST to level 2, and only use OFF, so you get 2*1/3rd*1500


[19-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Its the same results either wya


[19-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But


[19-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	whats pivotal to recognize is, the fulfillment output is the same, but the cost of the inputs, like OFF or SUN or DW, are different


[19-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	OFF is the cheapest


[19-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, I've been optimizing those with Archiel's sheet.


[19-Feb-24 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So realistically, its always cheapest to upgrade SST and INF levels and just BURN more OFF than to use SUn or DW


[19-Feb-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and with Art galeereis and wildparks, UTS and DW are the cheapest options


[19-Feb-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes


[19-Feb-24 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	My main question is if the legacy tutorial is correct that negative migration only happens at below 50%, in that case, seems like it would be optimal to only go above 50% when more population is required.

[19-Feb-24 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Below 50 causes outward imigration


[19-Feb-24 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You want to keep it between 50-70& when station keeping your population


[19-Feb-24 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Great.


[19-Feb-24 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	When you want to grow it, you want ti above 70%


[19-Feb-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	And how long does it take for an increase in upkeep to take full effect?


[19-Feb-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Difficult to say, happiness is a a metric of the "true" happiness of the current week, and the past 3 weeks


[19-Feb-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The current week is weighted 40% to the "current" happiness, last week is 30%, 20%, then 10%


[19-Feb-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But ive noticed that when you have a low low happiness and you are bumpnig it up


[19-Feb-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	say with a huge spike in pop demand you by suddenly feeding new inputs into infrastructure, Ive only see a 10% - 15% leap or so at a time


[19-Feb-24 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	that can be where the programs to bump happiness 20% can really come in the kick the happiness in the pants


[19-Feb-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But, as a reminder, happiness programs only add happiness on top, after the existing happiness calculus is done


[19-Feb-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	so if  your last happiness is 30%, and you want to GROW


[19-Feb-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and you inject tons of POPI upkeep, it will likely go to 45%


[19-Feb-24 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	not great


[19-Feb-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But a bump of 5% or more via program will cause at least an education boost


[19-Feb-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	to get it to 50%


[19-Feb-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	but after, the following week


[19-Feb-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	A level 3 happiness program can get you maybe over 70


[19-Feb-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and if you are pio/set/tec, and depending on existing population, that is the best way to get a bump for most planets.


[19-Feb-24 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That being said, a brand new planet with super low population? thats where immigration programs come in


[19-Feb-24 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Great, I appreciate the info. One more question: do you have a certain target for unemployment, and if so, how do you determine it?


[19-Feb-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Realistically, Every extra unemployed pop is a leech on your POPI inputs and happiness metric


[19-Feb-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You want your unemployd popr as low as possible while still having a nice buffer for new people on planet


[19-Feb-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	i shoot for 10%


[19-Feb-24 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you see any of the 6-7 planets I manage, its all around 12/30/80/600/1200 for primarily COGC industry price, with it slightly cheaper for off industry


[19-Feb-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Where can I see the list of planets you manage?


[19-Feb-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It breaks even, even with the upkeep of like 2-3 other planets i cant find govs for


[19-Feb-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	There is no easy way to do so, as I use proxy friends to become gov and set my corporation as tax collector, and then leave, so only I colect the cash


[19-Feb-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I see.


[19-Feb-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	but in short, I think I collect on a random electronic planet or 2 with minimal population, then Hephaestus, A1E, A1A, Electronica... whiskey is preventing me from remembering the others


[19-Feb-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	SE-886e?


[19-Feb-24 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	LS-014A.... A3B


[19-Feb-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Quite an empire.


[19-Feb-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	occasionally SE-648a


[19-Feb-24 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	you used to upkeep KI-840c but seem to have stopped after I moved in ;)


[19-Feb-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	that was only as need as its benefactor left recently


[19-Feb-24 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	as needed


[19-Feb-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	but yeah, to sum up, make sure you are looking at your costs from a cheapest material perspective, and level the POPI to allow you to provide fulfillment levels needed with cheapest input... and that your prices for cheapest materials are accurate. They arent tooooo hard to make, and folks like me have production pipelines to get it produce in quantity if youneed to source it


[19-Feb-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	just ask :)


[20-Feb-24 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Hello everyone, on a topic unrelated to the governance of this planet, I am looking to invest in a COGC and administrative center on QJ-382a. It looks like a good place for manufacturing: it has a high MGS concentration, and its proximity to here makes for convenient manufacturing of nylon or kevlar. If anyone is interested in investing with me, please send me a message. - Luke


[20-Feb-24 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	If other investors come along, then I'll give the 26 BWS & 3 BMF towards it.


[20-Feb-24 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Awesome.


[21-Feb-24 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	Good plan


[21-Feb-24 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	I can give 24 LSE and 32 LTA. Just need few days


[21-Feb-24 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marismols**:	I would suggest COGC as priority


[21-Feb-24 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Great. If one more investor comes along with LSE,  LBH, or LDE, they are welcome, otherwise, I will contribute the remaining materials for both the COGC and ADM.


[21-Feb-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Jvaler has offered to fund most of the cost for the LM and warehouse.


[21-Feb-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	like half lol


[21-Feb-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Well, your contribution is appreciated.


[21-Feb-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	:)


[21-Feb-24 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Sorry I had missed this conversation! Luke is correct, I ran Elon at a pretty significant loss. That's usually the case. But it sounds like a lot of progress was made on upkeep. My focus on Elon was to maintain the high level workforce, and somewhat ignoring the overpopulation of low levels. To some degree, esp on electronics or chem planets, it's sort of unavoidable. Mathematically your best chance is to keep all the needs level (flat across the board) to avoid excessive low tier growth relative to high tiers.


[21-Feb-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	So, yes, the overpopulation is a slightly costly bummer, but 100 extra engineers and 5 extra scientists is, in my opinion, not excessive at all


[21-Feb-24 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	26% extra pioneers isn't awful, look at Malahat (where I'm going)


[21-Feb-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Mathematically, there's no way to get engineer happiness higher than pioneers, except for the unemployment based unhappiness modifier.


[21-Feb-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	So thumbs up!


[21-Feb-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Final note: My governance sheet does have some population cost sections on the right side, which can help inform tax rates, especially the proportion of taxes across worker tiers


[23-Feb-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Thanks, Archiel.


[23-Feb-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	In other news, the investment period for the new planet QJ-382a has completed, and the ADM and COGC will be built in the next few days. Again, I envision it as a manufacturing planet, if others have different ideas, please share.


[23-Feb-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	The LM and the warehouses will be built as well.


[25-Feb-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Update on the taxes: after our week of fruitful discussions, I have decided to raise taxes by 75%. This will cover upkeep for POPI with 10-20% target unemployment, plus a weekly festivities program. I am aware that unemployment is currently high (30% for PIO, SET, TEC), and the reduction in upkeep should cause some emigration next week. Below is the link to my upkeep plan for the week. - Luke

[25-Feb-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Your happiness is way too high, and you're running Festivities at the same time?


[25-Feb-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	It's going to drop a bunch.


[25-Feb-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I am reducing the mats significantly.


[25-Feb-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Festivities are a very bulky, imperfect tool in the long run. They're fine in an emergency, but if you're relying on them permanently, you'll mess up the happiness and won't have the tool of Festivals if you need a quick bump.


[25-Feb-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	By 'mess up', are you referring to the fact that it would take a couple weeks of increased upkeep to return happiness to positive immigration (>70%)?


[25-Feb-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The easiest, targeted way to get a specific POP is through Immigration, which you can't do while running Festivals. If you drop Festivals to get, say, more ENG quickly, your happiness will drop to under 50% for that week.

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Also, you're attracting ALL POPs indiscriminately, which need to be fed, which is why you've almost doubled the taxes for. Archiel is right that it's hard to balance the POPs perfectly, but Festivals makes it impossible to balance properly.


[25-Feb-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	imo


[25-Feb-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Higher level happiness cannot be achieved without lower-level happiness due to the caps. So I don't see how festivals makes any difference in balancing.


[25-Feb-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	If immigration programs are needed, then mats for that week can be increased to make up the happiness lost by festivals. Of course there will be a delay, and the frequency of immigration programs will be a factor.


[25-Feb-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Lastly, taxes would need to be increased regardless of the unemployment level.


[28-Feb-24 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Hello everyone, due to my recent election as governor at QJ-382a, I am currently unable to run for reelection. If anyone else is able to run, that would be appreciated.


[01-Mar-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Howdy folks. I've recruited a buddy, Frozenice, to step up and run for governor to return taxes to a more normal level, which I will use to manage the planet and pop more effectively and efficiently. I would appreciate any and all willing to vote for him.

[11-Mar-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You might expect some distruptions of populations, as the happiness atm is only maintain by the FES, which I wont be doing. There will be some serious outward migrations. Please let me know if you plan any big expansions of pop, and ill try and make sure you get them.


[11-Mar-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The unhappiness caused by super high unemployment will have a destabilzing effect until the excess pop is gone. Once that happens, we should see the happiness at an appropriate level.

[26-Jun-24 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hello good chemistry people of Elon. I'm Rise and I run about 17 or so planets in Antares and its surrounding space. I've governed on Hephaestus in Antares I for about 20 terms, and the current governor FrozenIce is a good friend of mine that I asked to step in to help manage the planet as a proxy, as up until today, we were limited by Goving 1 planet per Player. Through his help, I have supplied all the population infrastructure that has allowed our planet and its workers to thrive since he took office 4 months ago.  If you were unaware, a patch was deployed today that radically changes the way elections and governing operates in PrUn. What was once a benevolent dictatorship is now a power sharing among the highest voted members of an elected Parliament.


[26-Jun-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I am unsure how the Devs heard players request "Let us gov multiple planets" and then decided that it was a good idea to impliment, "You need click 20 buttons and get to have 1-4 other people to click yes to pass a single change", but here we are.  Given the fact that anyone can now govern multiple planets, or at least participate in the Parliament, I am asking for your vote to allow me to continue to run this planet and continue to provide POPI upkeep and maintain the healthy population/taxes as they are, as Ive been doing for the last 4 months. Please, if you would go to the planet info, to the Planetary Administration Center, and vote for me, I would appreciate it. Buffer code "ADM QJ-650c"


[26-Jun-24 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You will likely see many people running for parliament on many planets as its the new hot trend. While I appreciate and encourage you to vote for me, I know both Paris and Nano_xXx, and they are great dudes who I'd be happy to serve with.  Additionally, I am running for multiple other planets with the same goal of simple and effective governance sans any drama, many of which I have overseen for many months via proxy governors. If you would check out buffer "POL RiseofFilth" and vote for me on any planet you inhabit alongside me, I would appreciate it.


[26-Jun-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	I can vouch for this guy. He knows his shit.


[26-Jun-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I'd rather have a governor who knows how to govern than one who knows a lot about feces


[26-Jun-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	bold claim. I've heard of OOG-Run planets failing to meet Pop needs twice. On one of the occasion an OOG-Governor did not handle it well. He blamed the wrong reasons for insufficient pop and his soloutions have been very money inefficient.


[26-Jun-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Rise migh have feces in his name, but when it comes to governing he knows his shit better and all that while being money efficient.


[26-Jun-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	OOG Doesnt have tax going into the void issues anymore with this update. I dont care who governs the planets aslong as they are well run. If OOG can manage it better now after the update I dont mind. But your reputation has definitly tanked


[26-Jun-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Given the fact that OOG has governed most planets in Antares for years, it's pretty amazing that we've only had a handful of incedents. No one notices anything when a planet is run well, it's only when something goes wrong that people take note.


[26-Jun-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Rise and his puppets have not had a perfect record either. Perhaps that will change when it is him controling things directly but I'll be impressed if he can successfully manage all 30 of the planets he's running on, including many with complex upkeep requirements. At least with OOG, we are organizing so each member has only one or a handful of planets to focus on.


[26-Jun-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	I have no issue with issues happening. But how people deal with them. Admit "Hey I made a mistake, I'll get it fixed asap" fine. But blaming tthe wrong reasons and crying about not getting enough money from the planet: Bad reputation.


[26-Jun-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	OOG has never cried about not getting enough money, we only pointed out that we were subsidizing many upkeeps out of our own pocket, meaning the challenger would need to raise taxes to make ends meet, which is exactly what happened every time governorship changed from OOG. We're not complaining, we just want people to know what they're getting into.


[26-Jun-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Claiming that you guys where good at governing while some of your governers had to pay upkeep out of their own pockets is a bold claim. Your corporation structure just added problems to governing because taxes where shared equal to their members. These are no good arguments for OOG.


[26-Jun-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	The new update makes stuff easier for OOG and fixes the biggest problem it had. I believe that no matter if rise or oog runs the planet things should be fine.


[26-Jun-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's a good argument if you prefer to pay less taxes


[26-Jun-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	you could still have low taxes if you dont set taxes to a corporation which makes tax to into a void and into the pockets of governors with smaller planets lol.


[26-Jun-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	That wasn't the issue. Even if we had set up single player governing corps, the taxes would not have been enough. That's why those that took over after us always had to raise taxes.


[26-Jun-24 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	what are your usual taxrates?


[26-Jun-24 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Our usual tax rates are low


[26-Jun-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	so are those from rise. And he's not running into any issues because he's feeding popi very efficient.


[26-Jun-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	it looks like it will be rise or oog or a combination of both all around ANT.


[26-Jun-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	both parties have been running planets very well with little to no incidents. So it doesn't really matter


[26-Jun-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	bigger planets will have more eyes now on whats going on


[26-Jun-24 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@churavis I think you are either misinformed or intentionally misrepresenting what I have stated on several planets. I have no intention of personally running 30 planets. Voters willing, I plan to continue to run the 17~ planets I've run for months and years via proxy governors. I hope to win the top seat in those, but alas it may not happen, and I hope I can work with all Parliamentarians on all planets to allow for continuing effective POPI management. I have just put 30 days of inputs on almost every planet I manage, which I could not be paid for, given the voting mechanics, because I hope to smooth over whatever happens.


[26-Jun-24 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	On the other planets I have historically not managed, I hope to have a seat at the table, to observe, and to offer advice and constructive criticism towards maintaining a cheap, yet effective management. Even if by some chance, I get the top slot on those planets, I plan to, at minimum, continue to defer to the previous governor, assuming they are in Parliament, for maintaining POPI. As time goes on and things are running smoothly, I hope to find new candidates with a passion for leadership and governance who want to join me in Parliament and potentially take over supplying responsibilities. I believe, instrinsically, that having redundant supporting industries for supply POPI is the best and most robust strategy to ensuring as few points of failure as possible in the logistical process.


[26-Jun-24 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Why would anyone vote for you if you aren't actually planning on really governing yourself?


[26-Jun-24 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	At the risk of this being all about me... I'm capable, knowledgeable, and my planets are a fantastic track record for health populations and consistent quality management. And I personally manage it across 17+ planets. No one else in the game can make that claim. So I think when I have advice to offer, it is worth listening to. Having a seat at the table will enable me to offer that advise, and the tools to act if there is an issue not being address by others.


[26-Jun-24 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And last I checked... planets have multiple seats. Every single person on the Parliament isnt supposed to fight to provide upkeep. Its not 5 different 1-person shows on a single planet. Its a single show on a single planet, and as a group, even among disagreements, they must act.


[26-Jun-24 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	No single member of Parliament governs. Even the governor is not all powerful. I plan to work with everyone that get elected alongside me.


[26-Jun-24 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	So you're hoping to not get enough votes to be governor, just be an MP?


[26-Jun-24 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you read the statements I've put out on other planets, you will see the answer to that. (spoiler, I'll take any and all votes, but I do not desire usurping existing leadership of the planets, even if I got the most votes.)


[26-Jun-24 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If somehow I got more votes than Paris on Deimos, I would continue to support him and his management of the POPI.


[26-Jun-24 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	So you want the glory without the responsibility?


[26-Jun-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	This is like taking to my neice who keeps asking "But Why", "But Why", "But Why", "But Why". If someone gets elected, they share responsibility with everyone else elected to provide competent management and leadership. That doesnt mean we cannot lean on existing structures and production capacity to provide POPI inputs.


[26-Jun-24 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If there is a problem and OOG's existing management falters, as has happened before across mulitple POPRs, across multiple months, across multiple planets, I have no problem with stepping in to assist and make up for any shortfalls. I hope that does not happen and look forward to working with everyone, OOG included, who gets elected on various planets.


[26-Jun-24 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	It wouldn't be OOG management though if you're top billing, it's the governor who's responsible in the end. they got the most votes after all


[26-Jun-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	So this "give me all the votes you can" despite chiming it's "not about ego" doesn't make a lot of sense to me


[26-Jun-24 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	If you wanna be an MP, get the 5 votes it takes and leave it at that.


[26-Jun-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	If you want the top votes, you'll get the top blame for failures


[26-Jun-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you are stating that you are unwilling or unable to maintain the planets you currently operate, let me know and I will take over for you.


[26-Jun-24 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I trust me to do the right thing and to maintain planets competently, as I've done for years. I have operated 20 months at Hephaestus and 16+ other planets for months and years. I have sourced and produced the upkeep solo with the tax revenue I've collected via proxy govs. I couldnt collect the revenue without them, but it would be dishonest to say the effort was anyone other than my own when it came to maintain the planets. If I get the top spot, I trust myself to do what is best, alongside working with the other elected Parliamentarians. That doesnt mean I am forced to personally produce the upkeep for it, if other are willing to do so.


[26-Jun-24 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So you may interpret it as me being ego centric if you prefer. I cannot control your opinion. My focus is ensuring all planets in Antares, to the best of my influence, are competently and efficiently managed. Having the most votes empowers me to assist existing management and new parliamentarians in doing just that.


[26-Jun-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so yes, you want to take the more glorious titles for doing no work, ok


[26-Jun-24 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	This discussion doesnt seem productive. It appears as if you are more interested in lashing out at me and projecting your own feelings onto my actions. I'd advise you reflect on why you feel the need to do this. My record on my 17+ worlds speaks for itself, as does your checkered reputation on yours.


[26-Jun-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	man, I appreciate what you do, but being an arrogant prick is a great way to lose all the favor you've built with people. It's not like the other factions fail, if you weren't here then someone else would run the planets


[26-Jun-24 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it's not something only you can do


[26-Jun-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Again, a false narrative. I've never once claimed I am the only person able to manage a planet. I've stated that I am experienced and capable, with the supporting industry to provide the necessary upkeeps, should the need arise for me to supply beyond what I already do to the planets I've managed.


[26-Jun-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I enjoy and am interested in the governing mechanics as a whole, as I find it rewarding to work on something that directly impacts and benefits the community as a whole. You may personally view it as trophy to be won. I do it because its fun and it helps people, and historically, not many people step up to do it.


[26-Jun-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The difference between a governorship being a mere trophy or not is whether you take responsibility for the duties of a governor when you run. If you are elected governor then you are ultimately responsible for the upkeep of the planet and maintenance of the worker population. If you aren't willing or able to take on that responsibility then you shouldn't run at all. When you say that you don't actually want to take responsibility for the 30 planets you're running on, it sounds like you just want trophy positions.


[26-Jun-24 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I think the entire premise of your argument is incredibly disingenuous and I KNOW you are smarter than this. Are you trying to claim that every single person elected, governors and parliamentarians, are personally required to each have their own parallell production chains for every single POPI input? That each person is required to contribute their own POPI individually? Are you planning on making motions to disemburse money to each elected member???


[26-Jun-24 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The obvious and infinitely smarter manuver is to allow the Parliament, as a collective team, to source materials, as a group, to support the POPI. Who it is, is completely irrelevant. As long as the group supports it and pays them via motions, why does it matter where the material comes from? Why does it matter if one or more people on Parliament do not personally produce or supply POPI, and instead just assist with passing motions, checking funds, watching income vs expendatures?


[26-Jun-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Any planet I run, including Elon, I will source materials for the cheap and reliable source. Whether it is me, or another producer is irrelevant. I will not expect other elected officials to "tithe" their production capacity to me or whatever the fuck this nonsense is.


[26-Jun-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	From a*


[26-Jun-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I never talked about sourcing at all. I said the governor is 'ultimately responsible' meaning you get blamed if it doesn't happen. What did you mean when you said "Even if by some chance I get the top slot on those planets I plan to, at minimum, continue to defer to the previous governor,"? That sounds to me like shirking your responsibility as governor, but please correct me if I misinterpreted.


[26-Jun-24 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Finish the sentence. Ulimately responsible for what? What has a governor, in the past, always had to do? Source and provide POPI? Manage populations?

**RiseofFilth**:	You didnt say the word "sourcing", but do tell me, what is it you get blamed for if "It Doesnt Happen"? What is "it" that a governor does, if not provide/source POPI and manage populations?


[26-Jun-24 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you are elected governor but you "defer to the previous governor" and then the upkeep isn't provided, who should be blamed, you or the person you "defered to"?


[26-Jun-24 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If I get elected to a position, it is absolutely my responsbility, along with everyone else elected, to ensure POPI is provided. Any position I get, I have equal responsibility, imo. If I become governor of a planet, but have 2 hostile parliamentarians who refuse to disemburse money to pay for POPI in any way, I'll likely upkeep for a month or so, and appeal to the planetary population but a better parliament next round. But at the end of the day, 2 Parliamentarians outvote a governor 10/10 times.


[26-Jun-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	For a better parliament*


[26-Jun-24 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But the point of "deferring" was to encourage the existing people to be the people we source POPI from, and pay them with funds from taxes.


[26-Jun-24 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But ultimately, if the Parliamentarians are hostile or do not want to continue to be paid by taxes to provide upkeep, I'll seek other sources to provide the necessary POPI.


[26-Jun-24 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And thats irrelevant of if I am governor or a Parliamentarian. The whole point of being there is to ensure the planet is being run well.


[26-Jun-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	OK, so you agree that if one is elected to the governorship then they should be ultimately responsible for maintaining worker populations. My original point was: If you are elected to the 30 governorships you are running for, or even just the 17 you say you want the most, how are you going to keep track of so many planets? How are you not going to burn out? What happens if you get sick of it and quit the game, leaving all those planets in the lurch? Why would anyone want to have you as a single point of failure in the Antares economy? That's my concern that you have not addressed yet.


[26-Jun-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Again, completely disengenuous. Have you read ANYTHING about the changes?


[26-Jun-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Say I am governor of Elon


[26-Jun-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And i never log in again. Does the Parliamentarians have the power to disemburse funds? To set taxes?


[26-Jun-24 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Yes. Yes they can. They can pay anyone in the game, including themselves, to stroll over to Antares CX, buy some OFF and DW, and fill up the POPIs.


[26-Jun-24 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Rise wants to keep planets well governed


[26-Jun-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So then really, your concerns are completely invalid from the outset, because the system is entirely designed around being viable even if 1 or more do go inactive


[26-Jun-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Unless the real source of your concern is for my mental health and well being


[26-Jun-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and everything else is just flowery talk


[26-Jun-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	At which point, I've flattered. But Ive done this for years on multiple planets, and I think I can handle it. I'll be around for some time. and if I'm not, well I guess its a good thing there are other people in government


[26-Jun-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Worker happiness depends on the past 5 weeks of upkeep, so inadequate upkeep won't show up in populations for a month or two. I don't doubt your intentions, I'm just certain that if anyone was governor of 30 planets they would inevitably let some of them slip through the cracks and then it would take months to fix, even if a parlamentarian could take over as soon as the population was discovered to be inadequate. I'd much rather have a governor that could focus on just the one mid or high tier planet with maybe a few easy low tiers on the side.


[26-Jun-24 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	High tier planets need niche upkeep MATs that one cannot simply buy off the CX for a decent price, making it difficult for a parlamentarian to simply take over at a moments notice.


[26-Jun-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	if the member of parliament responsible for providing POPI upkeep disappears and it takes the other two members 30d to notice, letting the POPI slip into problematic areas like you're concerned about, I'd say those other parliamentarians are asleep at the wheel and as much to blame as anyone in that (rather contrived) situation


[26-Jun-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	the reality is for most planets and most POPI, as long as the planet is otherwise healthy, a single week of missed upkeep is fairly meaningless and easy to recover from. If it takes longer than that for the others to notice they should probably reflect on whether they can handle the stress of governing ;)


[26-Jun-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	How bad is that stress of governing going to be when you multiply it by thirty?


[26-Jun-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I was poking fun at your claim that rise is gonna burn out by simply doing a bit more of what he clearly currently enjoys doing


[26-Jun-24 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I've managed over a dozen+ planet for months and years. I stockpile almost 30 bases already. I fill popi once every 3 weeks, and spam click all the COGCs 1-2 times a week. It is actually very little work. Taking the trash to the curb takes longer.


[26-Jun-24 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	my point is that your whole claim that, even if he does just outright disappear, his planets are gonna immediately fall into disrepair is just fear mongering


[26-Jun-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	we all enjoy different things. I manage a few really big group projects and I'm sure what I do there would burn some people out but I love it. My monday mornings involve accepting and filling a couple hundred payout contracts to a bunch of different people, which I'm sure sounds like hell to some but I have my process. Why would you assume that someone who manages a lot of planets would not have the same love for it?


[26-Jun-24 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Of all the people currently running for office only hernanduer has a terrible reputation in the recent past. He did not feed Nike's upkeep and the Population crashed nad let to people loosing profit. He was called out for that and his reaction was not: "Sorry, I forgot, I'll do better next time." but instead he blamed it on other reasons which got debunked very quickly. This is not how a governor should act and OOG as a whole took a bg reputation hit for that. Calling rise out for his ambitions and wanting people to vote for hermanduer instead is just unreasonable.


[26-Jun-24 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I think the finger point of responsibility is a silly argument to make. I think asking "What if" on if I suddenly get hit by a car or leave the game is also ridiculous. I'm here, I've done it all along on a number of planets, and I think its not difficult for me to help supply popi, or assist others in Parliament on various planets organize and do the same.


[26-Jun-24 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@harveyG honestly, that I'm less concerned about. Its in the past, unless someone wants to dredge it up. I'm looking forward and what comes next.


[27-Jun-24 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I think collectively, with the power of having many hands on the wheel of each planet, we can collectively ensure good leadership


[27-Jun-24 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	This is definitly true. But when the argument is: Rise has to oversee too many planets, why should people vote for him? Placing another candidate that failed to overlook a single planet can't be the replacement for you.


[27-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	OOG has governed a great many planets, greater in quantity and complexity than Rise or his patsies and for much longer, and done so wonderfully. Rise's record isn't bad but it's not perfect either. Relative to the planet's governed, the complexity of those planets and the time spent governing them, I don't think our record is much worse than his.


[27-Jun-24 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Do you judge a man by his worst moment or by the entirety of his life?


[27-Jun-24 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	patsies lol


[27-Jun-24 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	says a lot about where all this nonsense is coming from, I suppose


[27-Jun-24 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	and, to answer your silly rhetorical, of course we judge people by their worst all the time. Murderers are a great example


[27-Jun-24 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	less ridiculously, though, the reality is that governing is about trust, and trust is hard earned and easily lost


[27-Jun-24 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Do we judge rapist Brock Turner for raping a woman passed out in an alley way? yes we do


[27-Jun-24 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	So years of good governance of dozens of planets, many of which are high tier, means nothing because of a single incident spanning a few weeks a while ago with a single member who isn't even the main frontrunner here?


[27-Jun-24 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Who's being silly now


[27-Jun-24 12:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	I dont see anyone here argueing against OOG as a whole. People say that rise has a great track record and no one denies OOG's track record. I just called out the second OOG-Candidate. And my main Issue with him is his attitude. If he


[27-Jun-24 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	'd admit that he fucked it up and not blame it on other stuff. I'd be silent


[27-Jun-24 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I support many OOG's candidacy and I look forward to working with them. Paris, Katinga, Domincus to name a few that I see running in parallel. I also dont see those people in here questioning me and fear mongering.


[27-Jun-24 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	It's the attitude I dont like. I can oversee errors in governing. But for that people have to admit their mistakes.


[27-Jun-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's not fear mongering, it's a legitimate concern that I have a right to raise so that it can be discussed and the voters can decide for themselves. If you can't stand being questioned then you shouldn't run for office.


[27-Jun-24 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Your legitimate concern is that: Rise has to oversee to many planets as a single person. Which is a valid concern. You are trying to put hern with paris into the office. Everyone is fine with paris. With hern we have valid criticism. And the criticism is not about "everyone can mistkakes". Its about how those mistakes are handled and with what kind of attitude.


[27-Jun-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Sorry I claimed "we have valid criticism". I have that criticism. I cant speak for the others.


[27-Jun-24 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	For me it's: Paris > Rise > anyone else OOG > Anyone else > Churaviis > Hern. My reasoning for this is: ATTITUDE and types of arguments that are being made. Rise has attitude issues aswell. But until now all of his claims have been truthfull and not any straw man arguments

[27-Jun-24 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And I just wanted to hear more about Paris! Where is the debate over his health and motivation to play the game? Deimos is very stressful I hear.


[27-Jun-24 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Like, what kind of clothes does he wear? What is he wearing right now? Do you think he takes vitamins? His hair is so shiny, he must. THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THE PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO!

[27-Jun-24 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	I would like to formally apologize to both of you.  After thinking about it and reflecting on my statements, I would like to retract what I said about you. OOG does very valuable work in Prun and you are also part of this community. Personally, I think it's important to be able to argue objectively and clearly and to own up to your mistakes. I got too involved in individual situations that were not handled well by you, at least from my perspective, and gave too much importance to the past.  Translated with DeepL.com (free version)

***harveyG** deleted this message.*


[27-Jun-24 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Like everyone here, I want planets to be run in a stable way. This can be achieved with OOG as well as with the experience of RISE. Perhaps there will even be synergies in the collaboration.


[27-Jun-24 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	At this point I would like to emphasize that people here on Elon can recommend people from OOG without exception. I can make the same recommendation for Rise and his colleagues. I personally prefer Rise, but this is really just a personal preference and not a factual assessment.


[27-Jun-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	@hsrveyG, you had just started the game when that was going on on Nike, you clearly have no idea what happened and only know from someone else telling you. We were like 200 ENG short because I was trying to balance populations. "Population crash" LMAO


[27-Jun-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and now there's a surplus of 15% over because there was such a fit and several OOG members fed different POPI, rather than letting me deal with it.


[27-Jun-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	So now we're overfed and it'll have to be shrunk back down to 5-8%, doesn't take long


[27-Jun-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	of course, if Rise wins governor it won't be my problem anyways


[27-Jun-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	my main issue here was some discussion of a "POPULATION CRASH"


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it was 135 ENG in the hole out of >3000


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	to be precise


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so not even 200


[27-Jun-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Harvey feeling guilty aside, some serious revisionist history going on in here about Nike. If desired, we can go week by week in the POPR records and show each week where there was clear upcoming issues that were being ignored despite people sounding alarms in local chat.


[27-Jun-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But like, idk why want to rehash this months later 🤷‍♂️

[27-Jun-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Also, @Hernanduer, is it the official OOG position that if you or other OOG lose Governor of a planet while I sleep through an election because of your own poor management, you will just take your toys and go home and refuse to continue to support/provide upkeep(paid via taxes of course)


[27-Jun-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	that's my choice


[27-Jun-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	you want all the votes, get all the responsibility :)


[27-Jun-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	or just say, I want to observe, give me a few votes guys


[27-Jun-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but your ego won't let you


[27-Jun-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Strange, considering “I want to observe” is the literal text I put In Nike local

**RiseofFilth**:	but yes, my ego…


[27-Jun-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so is "I'll happily take any and all votes"


[27-Jun-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	also let's ignore the fact that Heph has been under 5% free engineers for the last month


[27-Jun-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and in fact was negative for 2 weeks


[27-Jun-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	JUST LIKE NIKE


[27-Jun-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That is how people tend to get elected, seems odd to ask me to, with over 7 days left, intentionally ask people to not vote for me


[27-Jun-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	The pop on Nike had issues. And it was an management mistake. But this is something I can accept. Everyone makes mistakes. My Issue was with how Hernaduer responeded to the criticism. It was very irational and his statements where not facts. Rise and rogan stated facts. But in a very poor manner. I cant blame hernanduer to respond poorly if he gets attacked like that.


[27-Jun-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	shit dogs, I can


[27-Jun-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	you're deliberately running a platform of doing nothing and taking titles for the legacy planets


[27-Jun-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That is the emotional maturity and growth I expect from a OOG gov.


[27-Jun-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Rise, I know you've said that you "enjoy trolling", but I think it would help to realize that sometimes it's just being mean, and hurting people's feelings doesn't help anyone. Not everyone enjoys being "trolled", I'd even say most people don't


[27-Jun-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	And comments like that aren't helpful either.


[27-Jun-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	the different between our comments here @hernanduer, is that I’m saying, over and over, I don’t care about getting the top slot. But whether or not I get it through no canvassing of my own, or whipping every Corp member in my 1 man Corp to vote for me, I will stand by and fulfill my duty to maintain the planet. If you don’t get exactly the spot you want, you are going to throw a temper tantrum and take your toys and refuse to keep contributing.


[27-Jun-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	that isnt trolling @archiel. That’s me calling him a child.

**RiseofFilth**:	I’m just parroting his own words back to him. His own words and actions are what label him as such.


[27-Jun-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You're free to disagree but name calling makes the debate less than friendly. Focus on the substance of the argument and let the public make their own conclusions.


[27-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The election is over now anyways so I don't know why you're all even still talking


[27-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I’m not hearing any disagreement or condemnation of his words to abandon his planet should he lose an election that is 7 days out.


[27-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I told you, that's my choice


[27-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	we are talking about Nike for some reason, because this is the appropriate place to have it


[27-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	after all, you'll be governor, it's your responsibility


[27-Jun-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	(if you are)


[27-Jun-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and I want to set a precendent here, being the first large planet up for election


[27-Jun-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	yes, is it every person’s choice to take their toys and go home and refuse to play if they don’t get exactly what the want


[27-Jun-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I won't have you walking in and taking top spots without taking the responsibility


[27-Jun-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	If you wanna have an honest discussion.. currently there's no framework or precedent for how a parliament divides up the work for a planet. You've got governor and one MP here, so you effectively have full control over the planet. That means it's the responsibility too.


[27-Jun-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	here is an idea. Ask people for their vote. convince them you are a good candidate


[27-Jun-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and maybe not throw a temper tantrum 1 day into an 8 days election cycle


[27-Jun-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	that's why we're having this chat on Elon


[27-Jun-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	So what are you advocating for on Elon- you want OOG to fill POPI? If that's true, this is not the way to ask for the help


[27-Jun-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@Archiel I realize you may not have read my posts across multiple planets, but to sum up, I said, “I’m rise, I do xyz, I’d love to observe this planet and make sure it’s run well and offer advice.” And then further clarified here that “no matter if I get any top slot, I would defer to previous admin/govs/parliament”.


[27-Jun-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I mean if everyone said that, nothing would get done. Someone does need to take responsibility. Especially since you and nano were gunning for total control of Elon


[27-Jun-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So I would expect, in any planet I’ve managed in the past, regardless if I get top spot, I will work with those in parliament, as their vote is as goon as the governors and can easily outvote the gov,


[27-Jun-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	You can't go for the top slot and 2/3rds of parliament and say "I'm just observing and offering advice"


[27-Jun-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I would offer to continue to upkeep and expect payout from the r tax revenue


[27-Jun-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@archiel I was referring to Nike


[27-Jun-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Here, on a planet I’ve run for the last 4 months, I ran for the top spot


[27-Jun-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Okay so, what's the plan here on Elon then? Normal as-before governance?


[27-Jun-24 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Nike and other planets run by OOG, I’ve specifically said multiple times I just want to help and offer advice, not take it over


[27-Jun-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but then say, give me all the votes


[27-Jun-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it doesn't make sense


[27-Jun-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	your words don't align


[27-Jun-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	This man doesn’t know how elections work


[27-Jun-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Why wouldn't anyone want to vote for someone who isn't taking responsibility?


[27-Jun-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	i don’t think you all SHOULD


[27-Jun-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	correct me if I'm wrong, your platform is: give me all your votes, I will do nothing but watch?


[27-Jun-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	but I can’t control your collective emotions and hurt feelings


[27-Jun-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You are wrong; and that’s not what I said


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	then tell me


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	You can stop trying to cause hurt though


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	in one sentence


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	read ip


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	up*


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	stop writing huge paragraphs


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	big words too complex?


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	they obfuscate the point


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	let me write in 3 word sentences for you


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	lol


[27-Jun-24 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Elect me plz. I want help. I offer advice. I offer support.


[27-Jun-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	comprend?


[27-Jun-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@Archiel this planet will be maintain as it has been since I took over via proxy gov 4 months ago.


[27-Jun-24 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I welcome all advice and support from those who want to offer it


[27-Jun-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	youre welcome to attack me because I offer you the same as I ask for, but I think it rightly makes you look foolish.


[27-Jun-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Ok guys. Lets make this stuff clear since it's a convoluted mess. Rise wants planets to prosper in Antares just like OOG does. How does rise want to achieve it? He wants to be involved in the government and help people run the planets. Either through advice or helping with upkeep. Rise will run that planet alone if he has to. What rise does not want is to usurp any existing governors. If a planet was run by someone else before he wants to get a seat on that planet to look out for the planet and offer advice or take things into his own hands if things go wrong. The ultimate goal to have well governed planets is what OOG and also rise desires.


[27-Jun-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	This is atleast my understanding. I've been working with rise for a while now and know how he has puppet managed planets in the past. So I assume I have an understanding of what he actually wants and will do if elected


[27-Jun-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	I think both parties got heated up because they havent quite understand each others goals


[27-Jun-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We want well governed planets too, we just don't want to do the work and have someone else take all the credit. We also would like to keep the debates friendly and focused on the substance of the argument. As soon as a person resorts to name calling instead of logic, they have lost the real debate.


[27-Jun-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	From my experience rise stands by what he says and makes truthfull statements. When he calls someone out on something he is making well funded arguments and packaging it into banter. If he gets voted on a planet and people run the planets without his help or advice I dont thin he'll take any credit for that.


[27-Jun-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	Because until now his Factual arguments have been correct. And if he would take any credit without doing something for it he'd loose his credibility


[27-Jun-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Calling someone out is different from name calling


[27-Jun-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	sure but you cant just ignore the entire debate just because he called the other party a child


[27-Jun-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I'm not ignoring the entire debate, I'm calling him out so that we can avoid it in the future and keep debates friendly and focused on substance.


[27-Jun-24 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	rise got frustrated because you kept misunderstanding what his goal is


[27-Jun-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**harveyG**:	I mean I dont speak for rise. But I've lost my temper this morning aswell.Which is why I aplogised to you.


[27-Jun-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I understand his goal, I just disagree on that being how things are going to play out. If you're governor you get the credit for how well the population is maintained regardless of whether you try to take it or not.


[27-Jun-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I do appreciate your apology and hold no ill will towards you, harveyG


[27-Jun-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you will stop attacking me, here is my first piece of advice.


[27-Jun-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	how about you wait beyond the first day of an 8 day election is over before screaming at the top of your lungs how I’m taking over planets you run, and then stating you’ll refuse to participate in maintaining the planet.


[27-Jun-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Or like, come to me in person and ask, “Hey, I saw you message here in local chatting saying you want to help, but my I’m worried with how many votes you have because I’d like to remain governor because it is important to me.”


[27-Jun-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	cause I’d be like, “bro, chill, it’s the first day. I just want to help. Tell me how I can help and I’ll work with you.”


[27-Jun-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	you know, or keep doing what you are doing. I’m sure my vote counts have nothing in common with the shitty attitude you give me every time such discussions occur.


[27-Jun-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	(And this is a plural “you”, not anyone specifically.


[27-Jun-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Who's screaming? The closest anyone can get to screaming through chat is typing in all caps and I don't recall anyone doing that. You're hyperbolic descriptions of us trying to have a friendly debate are ridiculous.


[27-Jun-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	You know, I'd like that and it would be a nice route to go in the future. I hope we can have nice conversations like that, but expecting that based on current past experience is fanciful thinking. I'm hoping our forced cooperation going forward will make conversations like that in the future more likely


[27-Jun-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	**but expecting that RIGHT NOW is fanciful thinking


[27-Jun-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	man y'all really hate rise, huh? trying really hard to paint him as the bad guy here lmao


[27-Jun-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	"bitches and moans" "hey why you bitching and moaning?" "me? bitch and moan? never, it must be you that's wrong"


[27-Jun-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	but hey, why argue when we can just let the elections do the talking. Oh wait, those haven't been going well for you guys now that people have choices, huh?


[27-Jun-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	might this be a little bit of the salt being applied here? nah, I'm sure you'll find some way to say it's not your fault you don't get votes. Something something rise's patsies, couldn't be that people see right through your bullshit, no no


[27-Jun-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Wow, you're as bad as Rise when it comes to sensitivity to criticism and ridiculous hyperbole whenever anyone doesn't think like you.


[27-Jun-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	ah there it is, my fault. Gotcha


[27-Jun-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	literally the whole criticism of you and Hern recently was that neither of you accepted responsibility and instead were overly sensitive to criticism of your actions on Nike and Phobos. It's a pity I have to bring it up again, because as was previously mentioned it's in the past and the actual failure itself really isn't a big deal, but to accuse others of being too sensitive to criticism in that context is a bit hypocritical, no? People in glass houses and all that


[27-Jun-24 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Did I cuss at anyone for criticizing me?


[27-Jun-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The endless mock outrage is tiring.


[27-Jun-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	so now you’re mad I swore? No desire to address any of the points of the argument, gotta nitpick that I swore in front of children or something


[27-Jun-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	"Rog, how dare you swear or insult anyone. Do not pay attention to the fact that someone from my corp make a personal insult first. Thats handled internally, BUT HOW DARE YOU."


[27-Jun-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If they spent as much time managing their planets 2 months ago as they do trying to invent things to be disgrunted over at me, their planets would actually be well run. Hell, the whole region could be run on such Herculean efforts.


[27-Jun-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I admit, Hernanduer should not have insulted you personally. I expressed my displeasure with him just as I have with you. Part of being a politician is being able to take criticism without resorting to personal attacks or weird "this is how you sound" hyperbole. Let's keep the discussion to the substance of the debate.


[27-Jun-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	what? I never insulted anyone...


[27-Jun-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	ah, unless you mean where I said being an arrogant prick is a great way to lose favor. I never called you one


[27-Jun-24 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Just a factual statement


[27-Jun-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	more a warning really, to not be that. anyways, I've said my where I stand right now. we all better learn to get along or it's gonna be real annoying


[27-Jun-24 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	No, that's a personal insult by any reasonable person's definition

[12-Aug-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hey All, just wanted to give an update so you are all in the loop. I’ve just initiated a motion to raise taxes from 12/30/80/600/1200 to 15/35/90/700/2560. This represents a 10-20% increase for all pops. The reason for this is at the latest calculations, the planet is pulling in 760k or so a month, but upkeep costs 752k. That is break even, and that is not good for a growing planet. Of particular note, I wanted to highlight the SCI tax. There is only 1 building in chemistry that uses SCIs, and it uses 100 SCI, where as most other buildings/industries use 40 or less. Taxes are collected per building. So those 100 SCI are generating less revenue than any other building, but their upkeep is 75k/month from UNI POPI upkeep alone. I, along with the other MPs, believe setting this to max is a reasonable move given the mechanics involved. So I’ve spoken with other MPs and received approval from both, and have put the motion up.


[12-Aug-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I hope everyone on Elon can support these changes, as they are for the health and support of our beloved planet. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in the breakdown of financies further. For now, I will just post the screen we govs see from finances.

[12-Aug-24 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Minor note, am dumb, messed up EEP area/size for SCI worker usage. It makes the math a little more friendly, and makes the tax rate more like other planets just fine. Going to run a follow up and revert SCI tax rate to a more reasonable level.


[13-Aug-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	FYI half the SCI here are employed in my three SPFs, which makes that calculation even more friendly.  And since that leaves 70 employed SCI, I suspect someone else is running something other than EEP as well.


[13-Aug-24 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Finest_One**:	I am working on fixing Sci jobs we may need to up UNI to level 2 down the road depending on pop needs besides that everything is looking fine planet wise. The planet does not have a large stockpile atm only about a month buffer for POPI and COGC goods so will keep taxes monitored as well.


[14-Feb-25 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Uni to 10! Follow EW lead!


[14-Feb-25 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I might suggest if you consider that route, that you reach out to Archiel to see if Phobos is willing to finance it

**Pxlfox**:	missing roughly 300 PIO rn, but will probably fill up in the next POPR, right?


[09-Apr-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ielisa**:	Yes


[09-Apr-25 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Finest_One**:	Regarding Temp Tax increase, Planet has grown and did not have any stash when I took over. The planet can fund itself with current tax levels with about 100k profit per POPI cycle. The planet is however about 500k in debt to me atm so we should be able to expediate that so the planet can run itself and taxes returned to appropriate levels. Thank you.

**Finest_One**:	Happiness Levels are looking good for the pops we need. Short 277 Set and 23 Sci. I will not run an additional program this week. Looks like we are capped on Safety now so i will monitor levels and see were we end up next week. Thank you all.


[19-Apr-25 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Finest_One**:	If a Sci base wants to fund a Sci immigration I will run it. 125k if not we should be able to slow grow the rest with 73% happiness. I will try to double run the SST this week
