Anyone with a free ship going nike to
ANT, unless @Deleted User you can run it for me quick?

If I may propose a small edit, making this a shipping and trade channel or creating a separate trade channel (just thought it may be easier than having to dm to order stuff/request stuff)


[23-Dec-23 02:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Done. ^^


[23-Dec-23 02:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
A sight easier, lol
Thanks a mil, sorry to be a disturbance.

No worries.

[09-Jan-24 12:09 PM] jvaler#0000

hello Antares friends! excited to help out how I can. I'm preparing for a pretty big expansion so shipping and funds are tight, but I do make a small selection of things in excess that I can offer for pretty good prices.
KOM: 500/u (limit 100/co/wk for now while I build up)
SIO: 50/u
sometimes available on request: PE, MCG, C
also available but less interesting: OFF, BGO, BCO, TUB
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[12-Jan-24 04:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
OFF and TUB how much?


[12-Jan-24 04:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
BTW I think that should go into #internal-offers ?

[12-Jan-24 06:35 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
TUB 140/u, I've got 2k available, OFF 90/u, I just sold a lot so I've only got 300 available but 2000 in production

pretty sure the damage reduction just isn't worth the price and the reduction in speed


[13-Jan-24 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
and that's just with 500 storage, it is more than likely going to be a lot slower with HHP at maximum load


[13-Jan-24 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
plus you'd have to repair with HHP, would you not?


[13-Jan-24 12:06 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah i wonder if the increased production cost of HHP just entirely negates the damage reduction savings lol


[13-Jan-24 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's some math I'm not bothered to do at this moment, lol.


[13-Jan-24 12:07 PM] jvaler#0000
same here


[13-Jan-24 12:11 PM] kapusta0577#0000
i dont remember a math behind this, but LHP are the best. make ship lighter and are cheap to make


[13-Jan-24 12:13 PM] havanista#0000
maybe u right, but anyway i need to build a hull weiding plant cos i have 2 high power blast furnace allready lol, and  there is no market in the whold universe for alloys, i have them on sale on all exchanges lol


[13-Jan-24 12:17 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd consider a Ship Kit Factory over a Hull Welding Plant if you want to utilize an ASM. BHP and LHP are basically the only hull platings used by anyone, and ASM output in a HWP can only be used for higher tier hull platings which don't have any demand. ASM output in an SKF however has much more demand because you can make cargo bays and fuel tanks for ships which are always being used by people


[13-Jan-24 12:23 PM] havanista#0000
yes i was planning this at the beginning , when i saw the cost of allows, i have gave up the idea, might reconsider now, since i can't sell alloyw alone, or it's very time consumming so far, take a longgggggggggggggg time


[13-Jan-24 12:24 PM] havanista#0000
but still i can make both, since metalurgy in the progrma in Deimos üôÇ

[16-Jan-24 10:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000

Otherwise I'll send them ASAP, 15k each work as payment?


[30-Jan-24 04:52 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I don't have anything planned for that ship atm so I can hold take-off til the cont comes through. 15k is more than generous for that trip but I'll take it if you're offering lol

Gotcha, no worries.


[30-Jan-24 04:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can thank cataclism for my generous shipping nature, he'd pay me 10k just to go where I was already headed to take barely anything sometimes.


[30-Jan-24 04:55 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I've noticed. I make good supplemental income for such an early position just on shipping though lol


[30-Jan-24 04:59 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
The grant -> first base running full -> shipping fees and I'm ready to drop half of a new base and it's only day 8 for me. I'll be returning the favor for ADI the second I'm set up well

[30-Jan-24 07:42 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
Sure! Also what's a POPR


[30-Jan-24 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
POPR (planet ticker) is essentially a weekly thing where population growth is taken into account and pops are distributed throughout all companies with open jobs.


[30-Jan-24 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Each week you get a small reserve of pop from the unemployed pops, however if this isn't large enough to fill your base, you need to wait for popr.


[30-Jan-24 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Since having buildings built means degredation which costs money effectively, building right before popr is great since you minimize the damage done to your buildings while maximizing profits.


[30-Jan-24 07:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Phobos isn't too bad with the reserve/unemployment so most got fulfilled anyway, but still nice to have it done in 4h not 7d.

[31-Jan-24 09:03 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Understood, it'll be whatever going market requests are (probably cheaper / discounted as well I'll figure it out either way it'll be cheap)


[31-Jan-24 09:04 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
You want a Nike or Station pickup when I get them done?


[31-Jan-24 11:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can add 20% to your price for the inconvenience and favor, nike is okay if it's better for you since it's going to Timbuktu anyway :)

[31-Jan-24 12:01 PM] avalock#0000
oh uh i need to figure out like logistics if i wanted to trade, its not a whole lot tbh, 605 ALO


[31-Jan-24 12:02 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
No no you fed my people when we couldn't, it will be more reasonable than that since you will have to pick up from Nike. So it'll be under market / or at cost.


[31-Jan-24 12:03 PM] cdgwaddell#0000

looking to secure a deal with someone producing LST on nike to reliably buy from them at a set price. i consume ~168/d (at 5th expert, 147 currently) on hephaestus
looking at CXPC and considering the logistic relief 115 AIC/u seems fair, though i'm happy to negotiate

no this isn't a response to the recent LST spike lol just a coincidence


[01-Feb-24 06:21 AM] cdgwaddell#0000

idk if anyone here has a base on Phobos but if you do and you're headed there from ANT with space any time soon let me know...


[01-Feb-24 03:01 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I'm flying out to ANT here in a sec because I forgot to pick up some DDT but that's all I'm picking up so I'll have plenty of space and I wouldn't mind making that mistake flight a little more worth my time so I can cargo to Phobos if you need something picked up. I'll have 497.14t/499.74m3 available


[01-Feb-24 03:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
sure! it'll be... a few contracts. god I wish you could bundle multiple things into shipments...

[01-Feb-24 03:21 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
12h 38m, I'll probably be on around an hour or two after that

If you want to change the item, you need to first change the amount to a different amount and then change it back otherwise you can't save.


[01-Feb-24 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
So if you want to send 5 rat and 5 dw, you'd need to change it after you do the first 5 rat to like 6 dw, and then back to 5 dw for it to save.

[02-Feb-24 06:42 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I have a ship headed to ANT taking off in about 5 hours, it's usually ~12h flight from Harmonia. She's free for shipping needs after that


[02-Feb-24 06:42 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Is that with max FTL usage?


[02-Feb-24 06:42 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Asking for future reference.


[02-Feb-24 06:45 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
No, that's just normally the most fuel efficient/slowest I'm willing to travel


[02-Feb-24 06:46 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
7 hrs max ftl/ min stl, 5 hrs max all on an empty ship


[02-Feb-24 06:49 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Ah, I tend to max FTL and do 25-50% on the STL slider.


[02-Feb-24 06:50 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
~200-300 SF is the sweet spot for fast and efficient STL flight, then it's diminishing returns. FF is a linear change. I usually aim for 250 SF, then adjust FF to land at a reasonable time to actually be at my PC ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[02-Feb-24 06:52 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Ah yes thats the number 250 SF (I usually hit it in the 25-50% range)


[02-Feb-24 06:53 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Without a bigger FF tank though max FF will run you empty *quick* so careful not to get stranded üòÖ


[02-Feb-24 06:55 AM] schizophoric_38402#0000
I've been being conservative  with fuel up until now, I only just bought my first supply of fuel yesterday lol before that I had my starter fuel and I tend to take Antares contracts that award me fuel


[02-Feb-24 07:05 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah, once your shipping demands increased its worth it. Fuel is cheaper than new ships and those starter ships can do *a lot* if you're burnin fuel and planning routes

[02-Feb-24 04:45 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000
>.> what are afabs anyways, I see them mentioned but I haven't quite connected the dots yet


[02-Feb-24 04:48 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the highest tier of construction prefabs. bfabs (BSE, BDE, BBH, BTA), lfabs (LSE, ...), rfabs, afabs. Higher tier biuldings require higer tier fabs. Also higer company HQ levels require higer tier fabs. So there's *a lot* of money to be made making afabs since that's the bottleneck for all of the biggest companies getting more permits


[02-Feb-24 04:48 PM] schizophoric_38402#0000

Introducing the KAWA trading list! This is a live list of things that I [probably] have to trade (green) or am looking to acquire (red). I will trade materials in green for materials in red *that are lower on the list* at a rate better than current CX prices. The bigger the separation, the better the deal will be. So if you make anything in red and need anything higher up on the list in green, consider trading for a better deal! üòä This list will grow soon to include much better deals. If you need a green item but don't have any of the red items, let me know what you *do* sell and I'll see if I can work out a deal for you anyway üíö üí∏

how does that work for SIO? it's a green item but it's at the bottom of the list so nothing is below it


[11-Feb-24 01:01 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeeeah... the list is auto generated so that may happen occasionally, or a red item on top. Just means I have SIO that I'm willing to sell/trade but it might not be at a discounted rate.


[11-Feb-24 01:02 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
all the items are positioned based on the price difference between KAWA's internal market and CX average. So low green items just meant that our price is close to the CX price so I can't offer *much* of a deal. can still work somehting out though


[11-Feb-24 01:06 PM] jvaler#0000
oh that's automatically made? that's so cool


[11-Feb-24 01:15 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah! I've got this sheet here that compares CX prices to KAWA prices and sorts them by how good of a deal KAWA's price is. The higher on the list the better rates I can offer trading it. So if I trade an item higher on the list for an item lower on the list both parties get a rate better than their usual. The boxes on the left I just check based on what I need and have to sell, then the published website list is just all the items with checks sorted by the value column ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø it was a fun tool to build and still improving before I expand it to a corp-wide endeavor. Right now I'm just experimenting

[11-Feb-24 01:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
next step figuring out a way to simplify inquiries about trade ratios and stuff. I just improved my formulas to automatically calculate an even trade ratio based on both parties getting an equal percentage of value gain (a model that is much better for others than myself, but the math was easier üòÖ ), so now if you tell me what you have to trade and what you want in return, I can get a list of trade ratios much quicker. Could probably automate it if I knew how to code better but eh ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[11-Feb-24 01:25 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Is there anything else that would be helpful to automate ? I thought about it but can't find anything that's not against TOS (auto trade routes)


[11-Feb-24 01:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you can make whatever tools you want for pulling and visualizing information, you just can't do anything that takes an action in the game, sending information *to* the server.


[11-Feb-24 01:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
There are some amazing base management tools out there though that do a lot. and some secret trade finding tools too that people probably won't share as quickly üòÖ

I'm working on a spreadsheet that calculates what I need at each of my bases, then I want one page where I can put in where my ship is at, and what planets I'm going to, and it will pull up a list of everything I need to load onto that ship while I'm there

in AA we use FIO groups and the findmat command with FIDO to keep track of inventory and burn

yeah, we use FIDO a lot too, mostly for the findburn command

we have another inventory bot we're working on too though that's really cool because you can set a buffer

[11-Feb-24 01:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it's like if you did findmat on FIDO and someone had 2000 LST but wanted to keep 500 for them, they could set a buffer and the findmat would only show 1500 to everyone else

Experts you get while your production is running, they also increase your efficiency. With the production you are running you will get Resource Extraction, Agriculture and Food Industries Experts. You can have a max of 5 per Category, giving 28.4% efficiency. Have a read: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/index.html

actually that might work


[12-Feb-24 05:45 AM] jvaler#0000
since there's a few more factors delaying things

@Deleted User kindly lemme know if you have any of those, or can point me to anyone who might

I want to make a note here that if you want to purchase anything off me, unless otherwise stated you can just send a contract for the qty and preferably 7 day deadline for sanity sakes. You only need to make a noise if you have other qry. or want to make an arrangement with the contracts. (Payment etc.)

If somebody has x amount of DW in a warehouse or a base they can transfer it over to you through contracts.

It won't magically teleport to Promitor.


[13-Feb-24 09:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
You'd need to ship it in, unless they had it on Promitor.

[14-Feb-24 01:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If you‚Äôre on Deimos it will probably fill within a day at 75/u


[14-Feb-24 01:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I bought 700 ALO and got it all within a day using the LM in Deimos


[14-Feb-24 01:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If you‚Äôre really worried about it I could get you some


[14-Feb-24 01:08 PM] literaltrash#0000
The more immediate need is 21 if you have it, aside from that I can probably wait on LM


[14-Feb-24 01:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
How about 63? That way you have a little bit of a buffer

Although an actual loan program could be something that may be an idea.


[18-Feb-24 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Perhaps open it up to the whole universe instead of just Antares, and use the interest payments to help fund the bank?


[18-Feb-24 04:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Something to consider, although not pressing at the moment, since our waiting list is null and void.


[18-Feb-24 04:49 PM] literaltrash#0000
True. And I'm not looking for more handouts, I've had more than enough


[18-Feb-24 04:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is always best to find the balance between handouts and when you should cut yourself off regardless.


[18-Feb-24 04:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
You'll never get anything out of this game if you never progress or make money yourself.


[18-Feb-24 04:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or in reality, a fine line between helping people and just giving handouts.


[18-Feb-24 04:52 PM] literaltrash#0000
Yeah, this first setup is making decent money, I need to actually settle on what I want to do with my second base


[18-Feb-24 04:52 PM] Deleted User#0000

Construction making prefabs on Nike would work well.


[18-Feb-24 04:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
They are substantially easier to transport and sell better arguably than AL.


[18-Feb-24 04:53 PM] literaltrash#0000
How would that compare to alloys?


[18-Feb-24 04:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
In terms of Nike? Much better to do bfabs.


[18-Feb-24 04:54 PM] literaltrash#0000
I mean in terms of a second base


[18-Feb-24 04:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Probably still bfabs by a massive margin.


[18-Feb-24 04:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
You could prunplanner it but I'd recommend bfabs regardless.


[18-Feb-24 04:55 PM] literaltrash#0000
Hmmm, ok. I'll have to run some numbers on that then


[18-Feb-24 04:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Especially since you make so much AL on Deimos, shipping would be trivial.


[18-Feb-24 04:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
LST is also present on Nike in abundance, so, you have pretty much anything you need on one planet.


[18-Feb-24 04:56 PM] literaltrash#0000

You can just download the .css and use it within better discord.

@literaltrash @.urpalhal I've got 700 more C to trade, if you're interested just let me know how much AL you've got. Same rate, 135 C per 100 AL

Deimos


[19-Feb-24 04:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôve got another 100 for ya


[19-Feb-24 04:29 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Absolutely. How much AL do you want to trade? Could do up to 300 from you until we hear back from the other person


[19-Feb-24 04:57 PM] havanista#0000
i just send you 100 al and u send 100 c?


[19-Feb-24 04:58 PM] havanista#0000

[19-Feb-24 05:01 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
rate may change in the future, this is a loss even for me, but we need AL right now and have some excess C so seems a good deal on Deimos


[19-Feb-24 05:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I could do 300 in 2-3 days. Should have 100 tomorrow


[19-Feb-24 05:04 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
135 C per 100 AL until I've got 500 more AL, then rates will change a little but still be good


[19-Feb-24 05:11 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm hoping to trade it all asap but I'll save enough to at least trade for the 100 tomorrow if you want


[19-Feb-24 05:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
alright


[19-Feb-24 06:02 PM] literaltrash#0000
If others want it you can trade with them, there's been a snafu with my ore provider and I had to send what AL I had to market, only 70 on Deimos and I'm out of ore.

You‚Äôll have to ask him. Idk what his rate is rn


[21-Feb-24 08:50 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah I'll have to reference my sheet,  none will be as good of a deal as C probably,  just because C is expensive at ANT specifically, but I'll check later. These AL prices are rough so I'll ship in as much as I can to trade with anyone who wants to

Here's the ratios I can trade at for AL, I don't have all of this in stock immediately, most of it I'd need to ship in from Etherwind, but current rates are:
```
KAWA     YOU
1  C     1 AL
8  DW    1 AL
7  OVE   1 AL
3  PWO   1 AL
85 PE    1 AL

If you want any of the other stuff let me know in advance, some of it is at ANT, but some of it I'd have to ship from Etherwind or Katoa

C delivery has been delayed so I'm starting to run low. If you need the C to use and not just sell I could trade for 100

Or preferably, both.

I‚Äôve got a spare ship with a mostly empty tank hanging out up on the station, I can gas it up and head out. What sort of timeframe?


[21-Mar-24 03:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
I won't be home for another few hours to set it up but it's just a whenever possible kind of deal.

Willing to pay my usual 10k for it.

@tanda Fancy doing a run from ANT to Harmona and Life or would you only be going to one?

@talryk Fancy doing a run from ANT to Griff instead?

That way if Tanda is already heading that way it'll be better for them.

I'll pay 10k for the ANT to Grif and 15k for the Life and Harmonia since it's a two trip.

Same. It's good for quickly drafting up ideas. Besides, i plan to use it to drown the other servers in Antares propaganda


[30-Mar-24 11:22 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
The data is unethical and most likely illegal, the art is bad, the people behind it are not open, the goal is dystopian, to replace the jobs people enjoy doing before anything we don't


[30-Mar-24 11:22 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
At the absolute best a draft that never sees the light of day and is used for a reference is just barely acceptable

You personally might not be john hollywood that will replace the writers with soulless lying machines, but showing any amount of public acknowledgement for AI art normalizes the idea it can be used


[30-Mar-24 11:26 AM] bojangles_1#0000
I like the motto. Quick. Punchy. And I like the color scheme and imagery

[30-Mar-24 11:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
In reality it doesn't affect me really, art is art, and at the end of the day what we are looking at is simply to gain a reference on what could be done.

Based on the limited in game lore for Antares "always forward" fits so amazingly.

"Always forward" with an image of a trashcan rocket, puttering through space

By lore, first to leave, last to arrive.


[30-Mar-24 11:30 AM] bojangles_1#0000
Either way, my intent with the images wasn't to start an the terminator war lol. Just to get ideas for what people in here liked so I can draw something better

[30-Mar-24 11:31 AM] jvaler#0000
the outcome may be okay, but the essense of it is lacking because there is no intentionality in any of it.


[30-Mar-24 11:31 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
AI art used for end-product is still widely looked down upon and public sentiment based on polls is more than 50% cautious or worried

For a discord the impact is not large and I am confident everybody here has the best of intentions but I am not willing to give any ground when there's people saying we already lost

[30-Mar-24 11:34 AM] bojangles_1#0000
As I said, I used it to generate ideas for something I intend to draw myself. I wanted opinions on the general art style and direction before I went ahead and took hours to draw something that might not have been what the members of the Initiative liked lol

Either way, I'll get you the last 100 in a few hours because I need the smelter cycle to end

no no, i sell Alo from nascent to Tanda, he needs, and i buy my ALO, becaus ei'm busy smelting Titanimin, Gold and Iron

is it common to just ask in #internal-offers  or here - or DM? or should I just setup the contracts i'd like fulfilled ingame without reaching out typically? whats uhhh.. etiquette for that sort of thing?


[16-Apr-24 02:59 AM] talryk#0000
Any of the above would be equally viable, I should think. But sending contracts out of the blue, while not technically wrong, isn‚Äôt something that seems to be common practice.

what would be recommended?


[21-Apr-24 09:57 PM] jvaler#0000
idk, does anyone here have experience with CLR? most of it's products seem niche


[21-Apr-24 09:58 PM] jvaler#0000
i know TRN is somewhat used for PT, i use the TRN PT recipe myself. dunno what the profit margins are on making it though

yeah it looks like I mighta goofed by making em

From what I have seen electronics are mostly used by other electronics there is only a handful of other endpoints that branch out


[21-Apr-24 10:01 PM] jvaler#0000
electronics (ü§¢)


[21-Apr-24 10:02 PM] seacilia#0000
It's not the worst fate, but It would be worth planning out a way to branch out with what you can make off of them.


[21-Apr-24 10:03 PM] jvaler#0000
best use case i think would be NCS, but only for self-supply for making things like NG or NR. there's basically no market for NCS alone


[21-Apr-24 10:03 PM] seacilia#0000
diversify then later on when you have a better production base come back and maybe combine them into say space suits or something


[21-Apr-24 10:04 PM] jvaler#0000
CLR is used in HSS?


[21-Apr-24 10:04 PM] seacilia#0000
Bulldosing is also an option, as long as they haven't been running too long you will get most of your resource back


[21-Apr-24 10:04 PM] seacilia#0000

[21-Apr-24 10:05 PM] jvaler#0000
oh and TRN for SEN i guess


[21-Apr-24 10:05 PM] seacilia#0000
pcbs and sen


[21-Apr-24 10:06 PM] seacilia#0000
Otherwise the only other viable endpoint I can think of is with batteries and lithium for spacecraft parts

I'm not counting the opportunity cost of selling these products, it's true, but this is actual cost to me to produce these items


[22-Apr-24 09:12 PM] jvaler#0000
and that's 3 permits worth


[22-Apr-24 09:13 PM] jvaler#0000
it just obfuscates where your actual profits come from by mashing it all together in the end product base


[22-Apr-24 09:13 PM] jvaler#0000
so with those models your nascent and harmonia bases make 0 profit but your deimos base makes extra


[22-Apr-24 09:13 PM] jvaler#0000
the exercise is pointless imo


[22-Apr-24 09:14 PM] tanda#0000
the exercise was entirely based around me wanting to know actual production cost of items in my production chain. I achieved that, but yeah, it's a bit myopic in scope


[22-Apr-24 09:15 PM] tanda#0000
I generally don't sell GRN or C so I wanted to know what my end product needed to exceed to stay profitable


[22-Apr-24 09:15 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't sell the GRN or C i make either, but that doesn't make the bases free nor the permits they sit on free


[22-Apr-24 09:16 PM] jvaler#0000
consumed or sold is all the same value, one is just more direct than the other


[22-Apr-24 09:16 PM] jvaler#0000
so using that reduced CoGM as a figure to compare to is misleading


[22-Apr-24 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
honestly the point of the spreadsheet was to make sure I had a baseline cost so I could know when it was time to pull out of the market

I know extracting ALO on Deimos is a loss over just buying it on the CX


[22-Apr-24 09:24 PM] jvaler#0000
extracting it for your own SME is, but dedicating the base to max EXT and selling to the LM is actually pretty decent considering 0 logi required(minus consumables)

@jvaler Do you have some MGS I can buy off you? Market rate of 185/unit good?


[26-Apr-24 08:40 PM] jvaler#0000
works for me, send for 224

okay, thanks!

[26-Apr-24 09:24 PM] jvaler#0000
wait i'm not thinking right, we should probably consult the project lead before deciding on a price


[26-Apr-24 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
well this is good for now. isn't MGS really low value given what else you're mining?


[26-Apr-24 09:33 PM] jvaler#0000
no not really

my CLI is set to 200/u cause that's the deal i have with rise


[26-Apr-24 09:35 PM] jvaler#0000
the alternative is giving it to you for free and just tracking how much MGS needs to be reimbursed for when the project is more established


[26-Apr-24 09:38 PM] tanda#0000
huh, okay then


[26-Apr-24 09:39 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm gonna send a cont to give you back the money


[26-Apr-24 09:39 PM] jvaler#0000
i'll keep track of the MGS in a XIT NOTES


[26-Apr-24 09:40 PM] tanda#0000
okay, works for me.


[26-Apr-24 09:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I mean, whatever price you both agree on is right


[26-Apr-24 09:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I did think we ought to pay more for your MG @tanda as we wouldn't have enough to begin with without you. How much would your base make at CX prices ?


[26-Apr-24 09:47 PM] tanda#0000
at current CX prices, it makes about 19k profit per day for 357 MG


[26-Apr-24 09:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
How much would MG need to cost for you to make at least ~40-50k ?


[26-Apr-24 09:50 PM] tanda#0000
around 150 each, which is unreasonable. This is a manufacturing base, so if I drop a couple more BMPs I can make a lot of other things to increase my profit margins


[26-Apr-24 09:51 PM] tanda#0000
even at 9 BMPs, I still have spare cycles to do PE with


[26-Apr-24 09:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Surprisingly it hardly makes a difference. Daily MG cost goes from ~8k to ~13k


[26-Apr-24 09:55 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If BMPs help you get there that's cool too


[26-Apr-24 10:03 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
You need cheap MG?...


[26-Apr-24 10:18 PM] jvaler#0000
the profit comes top-down depending on however much profit the PG makes


[26-Apr-24 10:19 PM] jvaler#0000
right?


[26-Apr-24 10:19 PM] jvaler#0000
that way everyone's equally benefitting


[26-Apr-24 10:21 PM] jvaler#0000
of course i'm only using 13.86% of a permit for all the MGS, but the numbers should be accurate and account for that regardless


[26-Apr-24 10:37 PM] tanda#0000
If I scale the base to cap (as I will eventually) I'm only going to use 36% of a permit for the projected MG consumption


[27-Apr-24 12:03 AM] .shiva.#0000
@jvaler sent a contract for some MCG, thanks!

if it's in stock feel free!


[06-May-24 05:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Actually, maybe it‚Äôs easier if we use currency instead of bartering üòÇ DDT is 3000/u


[06-May-24 05:40 PM] jvaler#0000
OH you wanted to trade PE for DDT lmfao


[06-May-24 05:40 PM] jvaler#0000
that's why currency exists after all


[06-May-24 05:40 PM] jvaler#0000

[06-May-24 08:59 PM] acramernc#0000
@uncle_leslie69 any idea when you will have BDE


[06-May-24 09:09 PM] tanda#0000
MG I planned on doing 100/unit. More or less pinned to the market through. Only reason I'm here is because the market can't support the volume this project needs


[06-May-24 09:21 PM] acramernc#0000
sent you a contract


[06-May-24 09:24 PM] jvaler#0000
what's your base plan? i could try and price my MGS around giving you ~50k/d profit per 500 area


[06-May-24 09:25 PM] jvaler#0000
err wait no, i need to know how much the PG bases are making first to give you a fair price


[06-May-24 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
I'm planning on further expanding the base in the near future and making my money elsewhere. the MG is not my primary focus for the base at this point


[06-May-24 09:27 PM] jvaler#0000
@histidinedwarf you're running this, right? what's the PG base plan? 24 POL?


[06-May-24 09:28 PM] jvaler#0000
right, but i can use the % runtime of the MG recipe and divide by 500 to get a fair price


[06-May-24 09:28 PM] jvaler#0000
doesn't need to be a full base


[06-May-24 09:29 PM] jvaler#0000
mm 24 seems ambitious with only 1 STO and ~250m^3 import per day

@jvaler if i pay off the ALO loan, can i borrow some more?


[14-May-24 06:19 AM] antisyntax#0000

Nope, I got a WCB lol


[14-May-24 10:05 AM] evany.#0000
im saving for a wcb lol.


[14-May-24 10:05 AM] realharvey#0000
if you run a full H extraction planet at some point you'll need a volume hauler


[14-May-24 10:05 AM] evany.#0000
where are you extracting from ?


[14-May-24 10:06 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I do lol, I‚Äôm governor on ZV-759g


[14-May-24 10:06 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000

full new ship or an upgrade?


[14-May-24 11:46 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Full new ship, I want 1 hauler, 1 Volume tanker and one fast 2k/2k


[14-May-24 11:46 AM] realharvey#0000
hauler = wcb? what is a plume tranker? xD


[14-May-24 11:48 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yes WCB hauler, and a volume tanker


[14-May-24 11:49 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
So I have a variety of capabilities lol


[14-May-24 11:51 AM] realharvey#0000
ahh I see


[14-May-24 11:51 AM] realharvey#0000
the best thing you can do at the beginning is upgrading a starter ship to a wcb


[14-May-24 11:51 AM] realharvey#0000
there are some ship upgrade mechanics that determine the amount of material that's needed


[14-May-24 11:52 AM] realharvey#0000
and getting from a starter to a wcb starter is quite alot cheaper than anything else


[14-May-24 12:31 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah I‚Äôve got a WCB for shifting my AL,FE and building fabs


[14-May-24 02:25 PM] evany.#0000
i need that too.. my ships are doing like 4 trips a week now just to supply AL


[14-May-24 03:09 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Harpercz supplied my WCB, talking like 800-900k for a WCB ship because you also need an LFE too I think?


[14-May-24 03:58 PM] akyantor#0000
Hi @.urpalhal , I've sent over a few contracts for BTA, BSE, and BBH using the internal market prices. No worries if you can't do them, just decline. Thanks

i don't think i can afford it


[14-May-24 04:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Morning @jvaler , I'm in the market for KOM. The last update in #internal-offers was that you were out of stock, is that still the case? Thanks!


[18-May-24 01:02 AM] jvaler#0000
latest update is that i'm in stock üßê


[18-May-24 01:02 AM] jvaler#0000
does it not update in real time on others' end?


[18-May-24 01:03 AM] akyantor#0000
Erm, I was looking at the screenshot which is the last post in the #internal-offers channel, which I thought superceeded the spreadsheet. Maybe I'm not looking at the right place


[18-May-24 01:03 AM] akyantor#0000
Is there somewhere that's dynamically updating?


[18-May-24 01:04 AM] jvaler#0000
ohhh that shouldn't be used for live stock lol. my actual post gets updated with stock and has a timestamp of the last update at the top of it

I may start contributing by offering EPO via the programme if there was interest, as that's primarily what I'm making. Albeit in relatively small amounts as I'm still early on,


[18-May-24 01:07 AM] jvaler#0000
EPO is good money, nice choice


[18-May-24 01:09 AM] akyantor#0000
It's a fairly safe fit with C. I'm also making small quantities of NR, but that's more of a gamble as the liquitity for that product is a lot lower. Mostly doing EPO.


[18-May-24 01:09 AM] jvaler#0000
sounds about right


[18-May-24 01:09 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, thanks. I may do that. I'm likely to sell either today or tomorrow, so shouldn't be long.


[18-May-24 01:10 AM] jvaler#0000
well i just had someone pay off a 3mil loan yesterday so i am in no rush lmao

[18-May-24 01:16 AM] akyantor#0000
Erm, amazing... someone bought my NR already! So I can pay you now.


[18-May-24 01:16 AM] akyantor#0000
I only put it up 10 minutes ago, very lucky


[18-May-24 01:17 AM] akyantor#0000
In fact... they cleared out the market whoever bought it. Now I wish I'd made more!


[18-May-24 01:19 AM] jvaler#0000
damn NR supply seems pretty weak universally... just 1k is enough to clear it out

[18-May-24 01:20 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, there's a lot of ask volume. it's just quite slow moving, as can be seen in the vol.


[18-May-24 01:20 AM] akyantor#0000
Occasionally someone comes in and nabs all the supply, but perhaps only every week or so


[18-May-24 01:20 AM] jvaler#0000
do you do staged/staggered pricing?


[18-May-24 01:21 AM] akyantor#0000
I didn't, but then my supply at this point is super low. I'm making about 100 a day.


[18-May-24 01:21 AM] akyantor#0000
So I only put 250 on the market today.


[18-May-24 01:21 AM] jvaler#0000
ah


[18-May-24 01:22 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah if your supply is really low and you don't have a lot of liquidity it can be hard to do


[18-May-24 01:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Only 28 days in, so didn't want to go all in on it.


[18-May-24 01:22 AM] akyantor#0000
I need stable income for a little longer I think, which is why I've mostly been doing EPO

[18-May-24 01:23 AM] akyantor#0000
I may build another LAB alongside more EPO production to expand the supply a bit, but won't overcommit for now.


[18-May-24 01:23 AM] akyantor#0000
I've tried to avoid having to sell at the ask price for NR, as you can get a lot more for the bid... if I can ensure the C/EPO covers expansion/operating materials.


[18-May-24 01:24 AM] akyantor#0000
That way occasionally I get a nice block of cash to do expansion.


[18-May-24 01:24 AM] jvaler#0000
you mean avoid selling at the bid?


[18-May-24 01:24 AM] akyantor#0000
Ah, I mean bid


[18-May-24 01:24 AM] jvaler#0000
ask is the sellers, bid is the buyers


[18-May-24 01:24 AM] akyantor#0000
Maximising the amount I get


[18-May-24 01:24 AM] jvaler#0000

@jvaler How is it that you offer MCG for free! Do you have a large oversupply, or is it just to help folks out?


[18-May-24 02:16 AM] jvaler#0000
i've been running somewhat scarce lately lol. in-group demand has been high :P

originally i needed something to take up part of my 20 BMP production runtime so that i didn't over-consume certain resources, and i just decided i'd just give away the byproduct to be nice. 
so the SIO, LST, and BMP runtime come out of my own pocket


[18-May-24 02:17 AM] jvaler#0000

[18-May-24 06:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
On paper if LDE is one of the 5 orders I cycle through it would be 19 a day‚Ä¶.. so 40 a week is fine (or less too)

Ive got some there if you still need it, send me a cont (:


[25-May-24 08:49 AM] akyantor#0000
Does anyone here sell AEF? I don't think anyone does based upon a scan of #internal-offers , but I thought It'd ask.


[25-May-24 10:19 AM] jvaler#0000
yup @darkgineer


[25-May-24 10:21 AM] darkgineer#0000
Welp, @uncle_leslie69 sells two times cheaper üò¨


[25-May-24 10:24 AM] jvaler#0000
that seems... ridiculous lol. CoGM for PE is like 5.5/u last i checked. probably up at 6-6.5 now that C prices are high

[25-May-24 11:01 AM] tanda#0000
I have some ALO buy orders out for 100/u, if anyone wants to make a little bit more than the CX


[25-May-24 11:10 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
if you buy the AR, i can make them on Nike for you


[25-May-24 11:26 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
3/u is less than KAWA price... (only by 0.1 but still üòù )

considering how slow AEF is, I can also spare some factory cycles. I'm dropping new PP2's in a few hours

Is there any particular reason why RiseofFilth is the only seller of EXO in ANT ? I was looking to add to my manufacturing and I don't wanna step on any toes


[25-May-24 04:15 PM] tanda#0000
I don't know


[25-May-24 04:16 PM] igfloz#0000
well, I guess all I can do is find out when I undercut him a little. I see@jvaler lists EXO in the internal prices channel, but it isn't added to  @antisyntax  group list at the end


[25-May-24 04:19 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't think demand for EXO is crazy high so they probably just make enough


[25-May-24 04:19 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I haven't checked in-game though


[25-May-24 04:20 PM] igfloz#0000
oh, ok.......... so I may be looking at a slow burn market for EXO, dammit I should look at chart shouldn't I ?


[25-May-24 05:07 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i'll be changing that soon, just need to ship metal over


[25-May-24 05:49 PM] jvaler#0000
the way it's been priced for a long time made it not particularly appealing to make, at least for anyone who wasn't already set in their ways making it. so recently the CXOB emptied out and there just hasn't been enough time for people to fill the gap, or the price isn't good enough for people to even want to yet


[25-May-24 05:51 PM] jvaler#0000
god with the new prunplanner update i can't tell if i should trust these numbers
but they apparently look pretty good? hm

[26-May-24 02:06 AM] jvaler#0000
i use ~14% of harmonia to make RCO which turns into OVE and EXO. it's not enough to be noticable profits but a nice convenience to not open CXPO buffers to buy


[26-May-24 02:06 AM] igfloz#0000
similar, I'm doing RCO on Harmonia also. Slow but steady income

wait that 14% might be wrong i don't remember... it's only 6.5 RCO/d so it's small

theres not a lot on the market.. if you ignore the crazy guy with 1000 units; less than 1000 units total on the market


[29-May-24 08:23 PM] jvaler#0000
not that much, that's why you need to turn it into LDE yourself

oh yeah I think so. Haven't looked to much into it yet.... still need to pay off a loan, and upgrade my other ship


[30-May-24 04:26 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah those ships are very expensive compared to rise


[30-May-24 07:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, all of our customers understand that the higher price comes with the benefit of them being immediately available and they've been happy with that.


[30-May-24 07:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
Some have even said that they are in the queue for other shipbuilders, but need a ship immediately.


[30-May-24 07:12 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah true, the fact that they're immediately assembled is very nice


[30-May-24 08:31 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Ships are more of  a QoL investment too. Sometimes the price is irrelevant


[30-May-24 03:48 PM] evany.#0000
how does that work anyway. buy all the components on a shipyard then just assemble the ship?


[30-May-24 03:48 PM] evany.#0000
buy and then just wait the 20 hours or whatever ?


[30-May-24 03:54 PM] flor2081#0000
yup


[30-May-24 03:55 PM] flor2081#0000
and I assume they'll provide fuel too


[30-May-24 03:55 PM] flor2081#0000
so you dont need to do anything besides put the materials in the slider, wait a day, and you can fly away


[30-May-24 03:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep exactly. And upgraded the warehouse to fit the whole thing (which isn't strictly necessary, but it's convenient)


[30-May-24 04:01 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah if you've got the money that's definitely very nice


[30-May-24 04:01 PM] flor2081#0000
though compared to AA internal market (rise) that's almost double the price, so I'm not too big of a fan personally üòÖ

@uncle_leslie69 I've messed up two contracts with you, set for RAT rather than BSE & BBH. Would you mind rejecting 1QEY0Z4 & VR7LIMD

i mean, its decent

not on berthier

are you looking at LS-093a? that also takes MGC üò≠

if you just need lst/alo that might still be the best option, lemme check


[01-Jun-24 11:11 AM] sidepipe#0000
oooooh MGC. I read MCG


[01-Jun-24 11:12 AM] tanda#0000
it costs almost half as much for base degredation as for supply

that's with CoGC though, if you're gonna build there might aswell build that too

export frequency of 0.9 days sucks though haha


[01-Jun-24 11:16 AM] flor2081#0000
wait damn, you'd be #1 producer of LST if you just do that

i also read it as MCG ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

how funny would it be if you crash the entire LST market with just 1 base?


[01-Jun-24 11:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
1 base and 3-4 WCBs üòÑ


[01-Jun-24 11:20 AM] flor2081#0000
you need to be there every .9 days with a WCB


[01-Jun-24 11:20 AM] flor2081#0000
and shipping time is about 22h from hrt->lg


[01-Jun-24 11:20 AM] flor2081#0000
so actually you just need 2 WCB (:

HRT CXOB only has 14


[01-Jun-24 11:24 AM] flor2081#0000
true, i'll have to get from mor


[01-Jun-24 11:24 AM] flor2081#0000
full base doesnt even cost 2m, so thats very decent


[01-Jun-24 11:53 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Hot take: HRT and BEN are better for most early/mid game and support needs, like consumables. MOR and ANT are better for the interesting late game goals, like ship building and fabs. ANT is a harder start that HRT or BEN, but great later if you commit to it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

if you want that deimos plot i agree. metallurgy isn't the nicest start


[01-Jun-24 11:59 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It was rough


[01-Jun-24 12:07 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but later you'll be *really* happy you've got that plot.


[01-Jun-24 12:07 PM] akyantor#0000
It may be tough, but wonder if I'll regret not having the plot. Started on Harm. :S


[01-Jun-24 12:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Vulcan/Nascent is also a great AL combo, or you could just do FE metallurgy on Vulcan. there's still lots of options. And Harmonia is filling up quick to and is a great place to be


[01-Jun-24 12:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'd argue that if you plan to fully commit to Antares having that Harmonia plot is more important than having the Deimos plot. It's like the only fertile option in ANT

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[01-Jun-24 12:09 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I suppose there are at least some other spots with ALO in ANT


[01-Jun-24 12:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Nascent is pretty good


[01-Jun-24 12:40 PM] jvaler#0000
nascent is literally a second deimos, just with a different CoGC


[01-Jun-24 12:40 PM] jvaler#0000
didn't mean to ping u cptcoleslaw sry


[01-Jun-24 12:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000
A superior cogc


[01-Jun-24 01:23 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
eh... usually the 'higher tier' CoGC ends up being more efficient. A benefit of Nascent is that it's not a starter planet though, so you could build a corp HQ on it


[01-Jun-24 01:23 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
actually... that's one we should add to the options @jvaler


[01-Jun-24 01:23 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the extra +10% is even more beneficial for a mixed industry planet (RE and Metal) because it can benefit both


[01-Jun-24 01:24 PM] jvaler#0000
wdym?


[01-Jun-24 01:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
we were talking about making an open corp that's free for anyone to join just for the production bonus. CULT or ADI or however we want to brand it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[01-Jun-24 01:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
we'd discussed Nike or Vulcan as options, Nascent would be a really good one to. Or Norwick


[01-Jun-24 01:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
ir Hephaestus? is that a starter?


[01-Jun-24 01:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
oh it is


[01-Jun-24 01:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
so Nike, Vulcan, Nascent, or Norwick


[01-Jun-24 01:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
or... all of the above?


[01-Jun-24 01:28 PM] jvaler#0000
heph isn't


[01-Jun-24 01:29 PM] tanda#0000
Nike or Nascent would be the standouts, wouldn't they? Most ADI members immediately expand to one of those two planets


[01-Jun-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
i personally wouldn't have value in nike or nascent as corp HQ locations, but others probably will


[01-Jun-24 01:39 PM] akyantor#0000
FYI - @sidepipe I've sent over a contract for 200 RAT.


[01-Jun-24 01:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah I'm just thinking of these being a useful free bonus for new players, so I agree that Nike or Nascent seem like the obvious standouts since they're the usual first expansions in Antares.


[01-Jun-24 01:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
what planet do you want a bonus on @jvaler ?


[01-Jun-24 01:44 PM] jvaler#0000
if i knew i would have done it already üò≠ lolol


[01-Jun-24 01:44 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

[01-Jun-24 01:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
right now I'm leaning towards JS-570a or RC-040d. My 2 chem planets.


[01-Jun-24 01:46 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I have more permits on JS so that would give a bigger bonus, but I could use the extra production boost on RC so... idk


[01-Jun-24 01:46 PM] jvaler#0000

how much RCO?...


[01-Jun-24 01:46 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I got a little extra at those sweet sweet KAWA prices üòÜ


[01-Jun-24 01:47 PM] jvaler#0000
just a little, enough to put me positive on OVE. rn all my extra OVE gets turned into EXO and puts me at like -2 OVE/d globally


[01-Jun-24 01:47 PM] jvaler#0000
but maybe i can live with it

wdym?


[01-Jun-24 01:50 PM] jvaler#0000
afaik all the PG bases are full POL bases, and the MGS/MG are below 500 area capacity. but if both raise +10% it works out

[01-Jun-24 07:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's about how much I make per day, I just can't ship it to ANT as consistently as other people here


[01-Jun-24 07:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have some things I primarily sell through here and things I primarily sell through OOG (and the CX ofc), so I try to only buy from ADI for things I plan on selling back to ADI

will have new stock in a few hrs


[01-Jun-24 07:42 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's fair, my priority is KAWAs internal market, but anything I have for sale here is excess and already making me more than what I'd make there. so even though it seems like a discount to everyone else, I'm *more* than happy to sell extra stuff here for cheap


[01-Jun-24 07:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I sell to KAWA, then ADI, then AA, then CX ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[01-Jun-24 07:43 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
and each of those steps up makes me more money, so never feel bad accepting discounts from me


[01-Jun-24 07:44 PM] jvaler#0000
i sell to ADI, then AA, then KAWA. that's why i artifically lower my MCG stock in the KAWA listing ü´¢


[01-Jun-24 07:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's fair. I feel like the ADI internal market started out as discounts for new players (that's def why I started listing my stuff), but it's pretty much become a sub-economy at this point


[01-Jun-24 07:47 PM] evany.#0000
i wondered if that was intentional


[01-Jun-24 07:47 PM] evany.#0000
but i kept to myself


[01-Jun-24 07:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it just happened organically as people played longer


[01-Jun-24 07:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
I had 1 base when I joined way back when and saving 20-30 AIC on RATs made a lot of difference to me, so I wanted to pay that forward


[01-Jun-24 07:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
and filling the RAT demand here and in OOG gave me some milestones. Still does, now that there are people buying by the thousand üòÑ


[01-Jun-24 07:51 PM] evany.#0000
same thing - i realized after a few days i could save money then buying off cx (even made a spreadsheet about it)


[01-Jun-24 07:51 PM] evany.#0000
and when i got the grant money after about a month of playing.. i went from making 3200aic/day to almost 6000


[01-Jun-24 07:52 PM] evany.#0000
then i got a grant and well; been crazy since


[01-Jun-24 07:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
I guess I just haven't bought much from here since I'm at the point where the savings don't make a huge difference, and I don't want to exhaust stock for others


[01-Jun-24 07:53 PM] evany.#0000
not to pressure but any eta on @jvaler any eta on that mcg

even if you're a more established company, if you're here you're probably here to help this community grow and I'd rather sell to you guys than the CX, so if it's on my list it's there to sell. I've no intention of just dumping it on CX if I can avoid it

I've been chatting with @evany.  and I think I'm gonna start listing my products soon(ish) OVE PWO & EXO - I have never really taken advantage of the associate trade prices for similar reasons that @sidepipe mentioned (sub-economy), but watching this recent thread is kinda convincing me that it's too good to pass up really


[01-Jun-24 07:56 PM] tanda#0000
I initially held off from taking advantage of the internal pricing because I had nothing to offer in return


[01-Jun-24 07:56 PM] evany.#0000
its okay if its free if you have a ton of stock! it can't be free if you have none sir!! sent


[01-Jun-24 07:58 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's how early game is though. This internal marked especially is for *exactly* that kind of thing. I'm listing stuff here cause I can afford to sell it at those prices and I'd rather it go to newer players than to the CX. I expect nothing in return ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[01-Jun-24 07:58 PM] evany.#0000
there used to be someone in here that maintained a spreadsheet i saw it forever ago that was old- is there any interest in that "coming back" ?


[01-Jun-24 07:58 PM] sidepipe#0000

it certainly seems that way!


[01-Jun-24 07:59 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
this game really naturally incentivizes older players to invest in newer players. just take my money already üòù


[01-Jun-24 08:00 PM] evany.#0000
thats kind of my take too. i plan to provide some stuff in the next few weeks i'd rather sell it for 600 internally than for 750 on the CX and both are still profitable so!


[01-Jun-24 08:01 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
hmm, thought: what about a channel for players who feel like they've reached the point we have ( @sidepipe @jvaler ) and aren't really buying from the market much, we're just here to invest in others. But occasionally I need something random that I'd love to get cheaper than CX, or CX actually doesn't have supply. Would be cool to have a more niche 'want to buy' kind of channel for asking for that kind of stuff that I know most newer players here wouldn't have anyway.


[01-Jun-24 08:02 PM] tanda#0000
honestly that seems like a great idea. If something is wanted enough, perhaps it might even become the focus of an ADI project?


[01-Jun-24 08:04 PM] evany.#0000
i thought about that too "Opportunities"


[01-Jun-24 08:10 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
in KAWA our discord has both a "want-to-buy" and a "want-to-sell" channel that are kind of a bulletin board style like the #internal-offers channel here. that channel is like a want to sell, wouldn't be a bad idea to have a 'want to buy' maybe ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø but KAWA's market also functions very differently so idk if that actually makes sense here


[01-Jun-24 08:11 PM] evany.#0000
yeah i think opportunities would be more like 'flows' rather t han one off's


[01-Jun-24 08:35 PM] .shiva.#0000
I kinda think using Forum posts like UFO and maybe have them bot managed would be the "ideal" way to go. I was sort of thinking about writing up a webapp+discord bot for fun and seeing what it'd look like


[01-Jun-24 08:37 PM] evany.#0000
ah yeah.


[01-Jun-24 08:37 PM] evany.#0000
bot could be cool to live update stock levels and stuff too


[01-Jun-24 09:48 PM] jvaler#0000
you don't need to put in to take out, the internal market is implicitly a way to subsidize whoever wants to use it.

Stuff happens! I normally fly back empty unless there‚Äôs a good trade opportunity, so I‚Äôm more than happy to wait a bit for cargo üòÅ

I don't think any of the things that ANT is known to have good cheap supply on are good or cheap right now, lol

Yeah, I had a good thing going for a while exporting AL and buying DDT for import - no more üòÑ

Hey I am looking for a steady PG supply at ANT or HRT. Does someone have some stock? :)


[04-Jun-24 12:03 PM] acramernc#0000
i think i have 12k at ANT rn


[04-Jun-24 12:04 PM] realharvey#0000
whats your price on that? and How much of that are you willing to sell?


[04-Jun-24 12:05 PM] acramernc#0000
haven't considered an internal price, how do people usually decide what their internal price is


[04-Jun-24 12:05 PM] igfloz#0000
I think there may be multiple PG supplies to ANT  (I maybe wrong) - I know @evany. also produces PG


[04-Jun-24 12:05 PM] acramernc#0000
yeah theres at least 3 of us


[04-Jun-24 12:06 PM] realharvey#0000
I consume about 9400 a Week


[04-Jun-24 12:06 PM] realharvey#0000
There are multiple approaches to that. And it is dependend on what kind of situation you are in


[04-Jun-24 12:06 PM] realharvey#0000
First rule is: Cover your costs. (obviously)


[04-Jun-24 12:07 PM] realharvey#0000
Second rule is: Keep in mind that your running costs might get higher


[04-Jun-24 12:07 PM] flor2081#0000
Third rule: copy the rest


[04-Jun-24 12:07 PM] flor2081#0000
Is what I'd do üòÑ


[04-Jun-24 12:07 PM] igfloz#0000
I've only just started - but I kinda drop below the top ask price (but don't treat the item as free $$) - it does cost you to make it in the 1st place


[04-Jun-24 12:07 PM] realharvey#0000
after that. Look at what the average CX price is and choose something between your running costs and the CX price


[04-Jun-24 12:09 PM] realharvey#0000
Price for PG has gone down over the time but is pretty steady on the CX

its a good mix between Green and Red orders. So poeple with time set buy orders that get filled and people that need it quick also use buy orders


[04-Jun-24 12:10 PM] acramernc#0000
okay, lets say... 34/u for now?


[04-Jun-24 12:10 PM] acramernc#0000
we're trying to pin the cx price at 37.5

how often do you want to buy? want to know how much to hold back


[04-Jun-24 12:17 PM] realharvey#0000
I consume about 9400 PG per Week


[04-Jun-24 12:17 PM] realharvey#0000
so weekly? ^^


[04-Jun-24 12:18 PM] acramernc#0000

a whole 0.158% damage


[07-Jun-24 09:07 AM] antisyntax#0000
currently im at 97.7% and 96.7% so we are perfectly fine until... 80s the repair point, right?


[07-Jun-24 09:08 AM] antisyntax#0000
i know one of them works perfectly fine until 80. is that prod buildings or ships?


[07-Jun-24 09:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
80% is when ships start slowing down


[07-Jun-24 09:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think for buildings the general rule of thumb is 90 days, but I think that depends on a bunch of different factors that I'm not smart enough ot understand

```3,200x MCG @ 0 AIC/u?
```
@.urpalhal - Do you have:
```200x BBH @ 1,700 AIC/u
170x BSE @ 1,000 AIC/u
40x BTA @ 600 AIC/u

Total: 534,000 AIC
```
@parisinspringtime - Do you have:
```25x TRU @ 250 AIC / u

Total: 6,250 AIC
```

@uncle_leslie69 - Do you have:

If anyone doesn't have that, can you please tell me a rough ETA on when you think you'll have that much in stock.

[ Picked up at either ANT or Deimos ]
[ All prices based off internal offers ]

Thanks a bunch!


[07-Jun-24 02:16 PM] jvaler#0000
that'd be negatory, it's above my listed stock


[07-Jun-24 02:17 PM] jvaler#0000

god damn that costs 150k??


[13-Jun-24 09:00 AM] jvaler#0000
it's 5% of the order's sale value, so 4k KOM @ 750/u is 3mil * 0.05 = 150k


[13-Jun-24 09:00 AM] flor2081#0000
damn thats painful

it resets after like a day so it's not too bad

Best part is 120 BSE is only like 100k while 500 AL is like 450k rn


[14-Jun-24 10:16 AM] jvaler#0000
BSE is always >1k/u, but still not worth 500 AL

100k / 120 can't be more than 1k

even if AL was 750/u it'd be 1:2 BSE:AL

BDE is one of those things that not too many people make due to the PP1 requirements

I think I mixed up the message. I meant BTA, BSE, and BBH. üòõ

bse will come in on my next ship


[15-Jun-24 10:49 AM] akyantor#0000
I might make BDE. Just working to get my Heph base up and running to make PE, then might get a base up on Nike. Could start out with BDE.


[15-Jun-24 10:50 AM] tanda#0000
the problem with that is unless you run PP1's you can't afford to make BDE below the MM, and if you do run PP1's, you need a FE smelting base on  Vulcan


[15-Jun-24 10:50 AM] .urpalhal#0000
well FE is just heavy


[15-Jun-24 10:51 AM] .urpalhal#0000
you could do a mix of PP1 and 2s


[15-Jun-24 10:51 AM] akyantor#0000
Ah, I was going to have a small number of PP1 to do BDE, and then have the rest be PP2, so I could do a small supply of BDE


[15-Jun-24 10:51 AM] akyantor#0000
As I will have the PE to do it


[15-Jun-24 10:52 AM] akyantor#0000
I've not a source of AL yet, so makes sense to start that way around for me


[15-Jun-24 10:55 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh i said I would have your BSE soon, but I finally ran out of AL. my life extending measures to keep my prod running while I wait for my AL to be returned by Yinxx couldn't keep up


[15-Jun-24 10:56 AM] .urpalhal#0000
so I will pull some BSE from another base

That‚Äôs what I do on Nike and it works out pretty well üôÇ


[15-Jun-24 11:06 AM] akyantor#0000
I think eventually it'd be good to be in a position to use the EPO/NR that I make to do more advanced fabs... but that's quite a long way down the line, and may or may not make any sense


[15-Jun-24 11:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
It would make a lot of sense! And you can just sell any excess EPO / NR you make


[15-Jun-24 11:08 AM] tanda#0000

My wife listens to me ramble about this game, then occasionally makes fun of me by rambling back to me about it (she doesn't play). I think it's hilarious.

>>> They‚Äôre going to want to build a base that puts out a lot of carbon. That‚Äôs definitely the most in demand commodity currently.

I think HYFs are a bit underused due to high costs in this area


[21-Jun-24 02:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd suspect most people making NS are making it for themselves and selling the excess, too. There's more profitable things you could be doing with CHPs if you're just selling direct to the CX right now (like CL)


[21-Jun-24 02:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
though the traded volume isn't too bad right now

I'll probably start up a base for it eventually. I might have 2 HYF bases in the near future, so it could be worthwhile üòÑ


[21-Jun-24 02:58 PM] flor2081#0000
i've found that even with 2 HYF bases it's still doable from the CX


[21-Jun-24 02:59 PM] flor2081#0000
but it does reduce your costs by a lot if you make your own


[21-Jun-24 03:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, that makes sense


[21-Jun-24 03:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
It's one of my two most expensive inputs atm, so I need to figure out if it's a more efficient use of a permit to make my own + sell excess or to do something else with it

I was going to make a CHP to make CL and then add FLX and NS to it


[21-Jun-24 03:04 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah it needs a couple 2k's fulltime


[21-Jun-24 03:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
might as well make CL while the prices are still crazy high

@razesdark regarding C for the Heph base, how about 550 for an initial load in of 1k C and 600 thereafter? That will help you keep costs down until the base can start paying back a bit

[25-Jun-24 12:23 PM] realharvey#0000
hey @.urpalhal I heard you are the right man, when it comes to HAL-Business. Do you still have capacity for a regular customer?


[25-Jun-24 12:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think so


[25-Jun-24 12:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôm not exactly sure how much HAL/d others are using but I still have 4k


[25-Jun-24 12:28 PM] realharvey#0000
I am looking for 132 HAL da day. So about 925 HAL a week


[25-Jun-24 12:29 PM] realharvey#0000
where do you produce it and what's your price? @.urpalhal


[25-Jun-24 12:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I make it on Halcyon


[25-Jun-24 12:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I will have to 1000 on ANT for 150/u here shortly


[25-Jun-24 12:53 PM] realharvey#0000

[26-Jun-24 04:32 PM] chobbycock#0000
Where is home? I have my SF stored at ANT, or ZV-759e, so you'd need to swing by there to get it


[26-Jun-24 04:32 PM] jcheung#0000
Ant


[26-Jun-24 04:32 PM] jcheung#0000
Well


[26-Jun-24 04:32 PM] jcheung#0000

[26-Jun-24 04:33 PM] chobbycock#0000
That's pretty much ant, why would you go all the way to benton?


[26-Jun-24 04:33 PM] chobbycock#0000
Ah I see, you wanted the cheaper prices


[26-Jun-24 04:33 PM] jcheung#0000

[26-Jun-24 04:38 PM] jcheung#0000
What's the bottleneck?


[26-Jun-24 04:38 PM] jcheung#0000
And do you do FF or only SF?


[26-Jun-24 04:38 PM] chobbycock#0000
Just not enough ships, with not enough space and too many bases


[26-Jun-24 04:39 PM] chobbycock#0000

[26-Jun-24 04:44 PM] razenpok#0000
@jcheung ping me when you need more RCO, we'll need to figure out the logistics


[26-Jun-24 04:45 PM] jcheung#0000
What needs to be figured out for logi?


[26-Jun-24 04:45 PM] razenpok#0000
Well, how to get the needed amount in ANT space


[26-Jun-24 04:46 PM] razenpok#0000
I think I'll just post a 500 unit buy order in HRT for 650/u, wait until it's filled and then ship back to ANT


[26-Jun-24 04:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Ah.


[26-Jun-24 04:47 PM] razenpok#0000
Or, if you (or anyone else here) have another idea, that would also be good

Bad currently. I have only 4 days supply at Nike, but Deimos is chugging away still. How soon are you going  to need supply?


[27-Jun-24 04:36 PM] evany.#0000
about 2.5days


[27-Jun-24 05:00 PM] tanda#0000
Give me a day and I can have 500


[27-Jun-24 05:01 PM] evany.#0000
no rush. i saw your big order for sidepipe the other day and left you alone for a couple days. normally i would arestocked by now


[27-Jun-24 07:44 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I just got that completed yesterday. apparently deimos already pushed out 380 in AL


[27-Jun-24 08:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[27-Jun-24 08:09 PM] evany.#0000

[27-Jun-24 10:31 PM] tanda#0000
Hey folks, just wanted to say with some increased demand on my end and having some semi-permanent deals with some members here, I will for the time being no longer be selling AL, and will have extremely limited C to offer. I do have some small supply of CL and NA available now, so that's exciting!


[27-Jun-24 10:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll miss your AL! Thanks for having offered it here üôÇ


[27-Jun-24 10:36 PM] tanda#0000
no problem! I'm planning an expansion in production but I have so many plans I have no idea when that will happen. Hopefully one of the newer ADI people steps in and takes off in that niche


[27-Jun-24 10:40 PM] evany.#0000
I haven't posted yet but if people need C, I produce a little bit of it now that i don't use all of it


[28-Jun-24 09:41 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv got AL production and very soon some C if people need it


[28-Jun-24 09:41 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[28-Jun-24 09:59 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Sure, can you just give me a week or 2 to ease the logistics then we can do a regular delivery? At this point all my ships are pushed to the limit plopping down bases


[28-Jun-24 10:00 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Unless you wanted a one-off 1K Al?


[28-Jun-24 12:27 PM] riseoffilth#0000
yes please. Regular supply is always good


[28-Jun-24 03:09 PM] evany.#0000
how regular can you supply that ? i might want more


[28-Jun-24 03:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Mmmm idk üòÖ I'm about to shut that production down, but KAWA might still have enough excess to provide a regular supply. I'll check. I think there's like 6k+ I can ship down for now though


[29-Jun-24 01:12 AM] evany.#0000

Out of curiosity, any player here would consider giving out a loan to help expand AL production in ANT?


[29-Jun-24 12:26 PM] tanda#0000
you haven't even asked for your grant yet, @shrewdsun_88540


[29-Jun-24 12:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I was told I do not qualify because I‚Äôm to big already haha. Even tho my company is 12 days old, I do have 2500 area of production online


[29-Jun-24 12:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
This being said I would gladly take a grant


[29-Jun-24 12:28 PM] tanda#0000
oh, okay


[29-Jun-24 12:28 PM] tanda#0000
I am currently going through another expansion phase, so I'm unable to offer a loan right now


[29-Jun-24 12:28 PM] tanda#0000
I'm hoping my CL money might make that a thing in the near future


[29-Jun-24 12:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I‚Äôm actually looking for 10-15M in additional loan‚Ä¶ need a ship as well so I‚Äôm making the rounds raising money


[29-Jun-24 12:30 PM] evany.#0000
im 100 days old and my biggest loan was 2mil


[29-Jun-24 12:30 PM] tanda#0000
I am 180 days old and I am taking my first loan from sidepipe for the INS base


[29-Jun-24 12:30 PM] evany.#0000
i think you'll be challenged to find that kind of money available to someone so new


[29-Jun-24 12:30 PM] tanda#0000
I did receive the grant though


[29-Jun-24 12:31 PM] evany.#0000
nevermind only a handful of people would be able to give a loan of that size


[29-Jun-24 12:32 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv already gotten 10M in loans of various form so not to worried about that. Not my first time playing so I did have a few relationships to leverage


[29-Jun-24 12:32 PM] evany.#0000
that said https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1202333376422625350/1202333376422625350


[29-Jun-24 12:32 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Iv got a ship on order for delivery in 2 weeks, so iv got a good 2 weeks to find the 10is million I need


[29-Jun-24 12:32 PM] evany.#0000
ah yeah prior relationships may open a few more venues for you then


[29-Jun-24 12:33 PM] evany.#0000
but to tanda's point i'd encourage you to take the grant, i dont think theres any restrictions on it especially any area-based ones


[29-Jun-24 12:33 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Oh grant, I just need to go to the grant channel?


[29-Jun-24 12:33 PM] evany.#0000
yeah i would encourage you to ask here

[29-Jun-24 03:02 PM] jvaler#0000
ik i sound stingey rn, but they have millions in loans right now already (including from myself)
i don't think a 750k grant is necessary


[29-Jun-24 03:02 PM] jvaler#0000
oh, archiel already took it up i suppose


[29-Jun-24 03:05 PM] evany.#0000
yeah fair, it seems a bit crazy to do such big loans early on but i guess if he has the personal relationships to leverage then. eh whatever none of my business really


[29-Jun-24 03:07 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm all for them skipping to late-game PrUn lmao, it just kinda excludes them from the "less developed" clause of #agp-information

[01-Jul-24 09:06 PM] evany.#0000

[01-Jul-24 09:06 PM] evany.#0000
i'd prefer to get conts of 1k


[01-Jul-24 09:06 PM] evany.#0000
but if thats too much feel free to send smaller and ill work around them


[01-Jul-24 09:07 PM] evany.#0000
i dont have a base or warehouse there though so set it to a few days (5 days for pickup)


[01-Jul-24 09:07 PM] .shiva.#0000
Sure, that's no problem


[01-Jul-24 09:07 PM] tanda#0000
would you like to buy 1k of overstock GRN on Nascent?

@evany. how about 1k @150/unit?


[01-Jul-24 09:13 PM] evany.#0000
i'd buy 3million at that price my friend


[01-Jul-24 09:14 PM] tanda#0000
that's twice my cost of manufacturing but yeah, like only 50% of the market


[01-Jul-24 09:14 PM] evany.#0000
right now im buying for higher than that and im having to ship it!


[01-Jul-24 09:15 PM] evany.#0000

its hard to ship enough !


[01-Jul-24 09:17 PM] evany.#0000
i re-read your message and you mentioned grn OR  hcp


[01-Jul-24 09:17 PM] evany.#0000
if you do a mix - just keep them at 1k as its all i can haul at the moment ! 770grn 230 hcp is perfect


[01-Jul-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
I only make about 20 extra GRN a day, so that's literally 50 days worth of overstock

My ships are going that direction anyways


[02-Jul-24 04:34 PM] razenpok#0000
I just figured: I'm going to bed now (11:34 PM CEST), and if somebody sends me a cont, this somebody probably won't be online to provision the shipment when I wake up tomorrow


[02-Jul-24 04:35 PM] jvaler#0000
fair


[02-Jul-24 04:35 PM] jvaler#0000
i guess there really isn't a way to win


[02-Jul-24 04:35 PM] razenpok#0000
Ye, it's kinda strange that there's no auto-provision for custom conts

AVG CL cost is about 1700/u if you get everything from the CX. If you source HAL from our HAL guy, then you are making profit

How does LDE @ 8k, LSE @6.6k, LBH @ 2.1k, LTA @ 2.8k sound? That's about 1k below buy for the LDE and LSE, 500 below for LBH and LTA. Call it a bulk discount üòÑ

Question : Is there a real demand for NL in ADI ? I know that I have fed small amounts to @.urpalhal but I don't see any  requests from recognisable people on ANT CX


[11-Jul-24 03:15 PM] realharvey#0000
depending on the price I'll buy all the NL


[11-Jul-24 03:15 PM] realharvey#0000
I can supply with PG


[11-Jul-24 03:15 PM] realharvey#0000

@.urpalhal i got a bunch of NL if you still buying it?


[11-Jul-24 03:47 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
80 rn


[11-Jul-24 03:51 PM] realharvey#0000
I have two full bases on my own making PG. But I also burn alot lol.


[11-Jul-24 03:51 PM] realharvey#0000
whats your price?


[11-Jul-24 03:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Sound like I need to make a dedicated LFAB base


[11-Jul-24 03:53 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
3500/u


[11-Jul-24 03:53 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
The current CX is 4250/u, so good bit off the price


[11-Jul-24 03:54 PM] igfloz#0000
..not so much (maybe) - I was thinking about how the price has dropped in the last 30 days - I mean I used to sell @ >6K/u, but I don't see an ADI "demand" on the CX


[11-Jul-24 03:55 PM] realharvey#0000
with that price I'd be selling LDE at a loss when I use my internal pricing. But others will probably buy it at that price


[11-Jul-24 03:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh well I stopped asking for NL on CX bc I would wait months for any NL


[11-Jul-24 03:55 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
what price were you thinking?


[11-Jul-24 04:00 PM] realharvey#0000
My Target LDE Price is 4800/u


[11-Jul-24 04:00 PM] realharvey#0000
I produce my own AL at 560/u


[11-Jul-24 04:01 PM] realharvey#0000
dont sell NL to me


[11-Jul-24 04:06 PM] jcheung#0000
What does your current NL cost? üòÆ


[11-Jul-24 04:07 PM] evany.#0000
is that achieveable ? not to sound c razy we can take it to dm's
@ 560 AL your targeting like 
thats like 1650 leaving yourself 10% profit your target NL cost is like max of 1800?


[11-Jul-24 04:08 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i've not even calculated what my LDE costs to make,
i make my own C, H, NL, PG & AL though so probs cheap


[11-Jul-24 04:09 PM] realharvey#0000
your NL costs you probably about 1600-1800/u


[11-Jul-24 04:09 PM] realharvey#0000
I also produce NL myself and my LDE target margins are thin


[11-Jul-24 04:10 PM] realharvey#0000
this makes me unable to source from you guys without feeling bad


[11-Jul-24 04:10 PM] jcheung#0000
Is the LDE just for personal use?


[11-Jul-24 04:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
we all source from each other and feel bad about it üòõ


[11-Jul-24 04:10 PM] realharvey#0000
I sell it to rise and roganartu so they can help newer players build bases :)


[11-Jul-24 04:11 PM] jcheung#0000
I'm still in the mooching phase üò¨ need to grow a bit before i can really contribute


[11-Jul-24 04:11 PM] igfloz#0000
so... you have all kinda answered a major question I was thinking about. Is NL only really being used for LDE ?


[11-Jul-24 04:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's how the whole thing works. You feel so bad about buying cheap from others that you start selling cheap, and the cycle continues üòÑ


[11-Jul-24 04:12 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
mainly, you can make HSS with it too but meh


[11-Jul-24 04:12 PM] igfloz#0000
hence the peaks and troughs in sales chart - kinda makes sense


[11-Jul-24 04:13 PM] realharvey#0000
1 Full PP2 base producing LDE takes 3 Bases producing NL


[11-Jul-24 04:13 PM] realharvey#0000
there will always be enough demand for NL


[11-Jul-24 04:13 PM] realharvey#0000
just the pricing has to be right


[11-Jul-24 04:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
@jcheung  jokes aside though, the ADI market is no-obligation. People list their stuff at those prices because they're happy to sell to you at those prices. So you shouldn't feel bad about taking advantage of those offers, and no one expects discounts just because they sold to you at a low price


[11-Jul-24 04:14 PM] realharvey#0000
I actually want to save on permits and let other people produce NL for me. But I havent found a way that makes it worth while for everyone


[11-Jul-24 04:14 PM] jcheung#0000
If your goal is low profit production for base starting, that's a hard proposition to handle


[11-Jul-24 04:15 PM] jcheung#0000
What price can you source pg at?


[11-Jul-24 04:15 PM] realharvey#0000
I produce it myself for about 23/u


[11-Jul-24 04:15 PM] realharvey#0000
and I source it from here for about 35/u


[11-Jul-24 04:18 PM] jcheung#0000
Tried to pick a number in the middle and at 27/u it *costs* 2.3k each to even make


[11-Jul-24 04:19 PM] realharvey#0000
Oh I forgot. I source my own ALO now. My AL is actually cheaper


[11-Jul-24 04:19 PM] realharvey#0000
I can produce LDE for 3265/u (with 24/u PG price)

{Reactions}
üò± 

[11-Jul-24 04:20 PM] realharvey#0000
but that takes me 3 WPL bases, 1 ALO Base, 1 AL Base and the PP2 base


[11-Jul-24 04:21 PM] realharvey#0000
so basically 6 Permits


[11-Jul-24 04:21 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm assuming full permits ?


[11-Jul-24 04:21 PM] realharvey#0000
only ALO isnt fully required

My mistake, forgot to put in experts. 2.1k


[11-Jul-24 04:23 PM] realharvey#0000
I do want to get rid of the NL bases tho since they take up alot of permits


[11-Jul-24 04:28 PM] evany.#0000
funny i was just talking to someone about spinning up NL


[11-Jul-24 04:35 PM] realharvey#0000
thats cool :) But I can't buy it from you for a reasonable price for my ambitions sorry


[11-Jul-24 04:36 PM] evany.#0000
for sure


[11-Jul-24 08:56 PM] nyanism#0000
only way is prolly you rent the permit lol, its hardly going to worth selling NL at that price for that very purpose


[11-Jul-24 09:08 PM] tanda#0000
@acramernc I'll buy all your overstock ALO every week at 100/unit if you like. The forges hunger

okay, otherwise I would have sold it to you at a discount


[12-Jul-24 08:28 AM] acramernc#0000
PSL is the only thing i actually had on hand, i think i got a bunch extra from my last base

When I just began playing prun I had this idea of circular logistics network between all major CXs, and I imagined it operating with two ships, one going clockwise, and other going counter-clockwise. Hence electron and positron ship names

Select template and fill -> Buy -> MCG -> Amount -> Save tamplate


[26-Jul-24 01:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
if you can wait 1000 MCG is arriving on ANT in 4 hours


[26-Jul-24 01:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
or you can just buy it off the market if you have money for it


[26-Jul-24 01:15 PM] marat_sh#0000

I'm not in any need, so def let others trade first, but if you have leftover KOM or DDT (or even HER) I'd be happy to trade a bunch of H or OFF if you find those things useful


[29-Jul-24 09:30 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm top PE producer in game and the only thing I import is the H. And KAWA governs like 12 planets with over 1.3m total pop. I would *love* some H and OFF ü•∞ lol


[29-Jul-24 09:31 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
let me check my sheet and see how well those trade


[29-Jul-24 09:31 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
looks like the OFF is a pretty terrible trade, but the H is great.

üòÜ nah you're good. I'm winding down bases to reduce the day to day need for game stuff like shipping and keeping up with repairs and all that. But I still plan to do some trading and governing. I won't be making any more DDT, but I'm happy to sell you my remaining stockpile whenever you need some. I'll keep it stocked at ANT until it's gone


[29-Jul-24 10:11 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
guess it doesn't matter too much right now anyway though. With these KOM prices you don't need cheap DDT to profit


[29-Jul-24 10:21 PM] jvaler#0000
well i may as well buy it all out cause i'll need it eventually. how much you have?


[29-Jul-24 10:56 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'll have to check tomorrow, but probably 1000 total between ANT, BEN, and Proxion

[01-Aug-24 09:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
And I guess I should add that the NA is no strings attached, you don‚Äôt need to sell any SF here if you don‚Äôt want to. I just brought it up since I know people were talking about fuel supply a lot recently


[01-Aug-24 09:52 AM] chobbycock#0000
Yea na, the plan was always to sell it in here, as its a good market since everyone needs it and if I can do it at a lower price once I'm fully set up its consistent income


[01-Aug-24 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
Sounds good üôÇ


[01-Aug-24 09:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
Feel free to hmu if you need any help with financing or anything like that. I‚Äôd be happy to do 0 interest loans if you‚Äôd find that useful


[01-Aug-24 11:22 AM] chobbycock#0000
Sorry just seen this, that is definitely something I'd be interested in. Planning on setting up about 4 refinery planets in total to meet expected demand so I'll definitely need funds for the bases, plus probably another ship to handle the logistics of it


[01-Aug-24 11:28 AM] sidepipe#0000
Are you planning on doing all this at once, or in stages? I probably don‚Äôt have deep enough pockets to finance everything, but I‚Äôd definitely help you get the first or second base off the ground


[01-Aug-24 11:32 AM] chobbycock#0000
In stages, don't want to overwhelm myself. I already have a refinery planet on the go, my next step is sorting a NAB production chain that can supply all my planned refinery's


[01-Aug-24 11:33 AM] chobbycock#0000
I've got a plan set up for a NAB production base on electronica, that when fully operational can supply all my refinerys, I've pretty much got all of the things I need for that so planning on doing that in the next day or two


[01-Aug-24 11:34 AM] chobbycock#0000
So right now the only thing I'd say I'd desperatly need is maybe a loan for another ship to get my logistics under control, biggest issue I'm facing currently is shipping liquids and gasses about in high enough numbers to sustain everything


[01-Aug-24 11:36 AM] sidepipe#0000

cost to make 1 unit of INS is around $60 (materials) and it sells for more then double of that price... ü•≤


[03-Aug-24 12:34 AM] realharvey#0000
Did you include consumables and repair cost?


[03-Aug-24 12:35 AM] marat_sh#0000
no, just material cost


[03-Aug-24 12:36 AM] marat_sh#0000
fills like the recipe should produce more considering the investment it takes to start the production


[03-Aug-24 12:38 AM] riseoffilth#0000
it used to produce less. They buffed it


[03-Aug-24 12:39 AM] marat_sh#0000
next buff should be lowering the amount that is required to build


[03-Aug-24 12:39 AM] realharvey#0000
Hey bro you need sleep

[03-Aug-24 12:42 AM] marat_sh#0000
Is ROI > 30d?


[03-Aug-24 12:42 AM] tanda#0000
17.26days for that


[03-Aug-24 12:43 AM] tanda#0000
so I've already recouped construction costs


[03-Aug-24 12:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
So we just need more INS bases


[03-Aug-24 12:46 AM] realharvey#0000
Well when the market is saturated the price will fall significant


[03-Aug-24 12:47 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, that's the point. Then it'll be a lot cheaper to run bases on INS planets


[03-Aug-24 12:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
Fills like people on CX don't compete with each other and sit waiting for sales


[03-Aug-24 12:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
since people will buy at higher price anyway


[03-Aug-24 12:48 AM] tanda#0000
honestly yes. Both me and evayoo hold some in reserve for ADI


[03-Aug-24 12:49 AM] marat_sh#0000
its happening to every good on CX, not just INS


[03-Aug-24 12:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
DW, RAT, PE, OVE, C and some more the only ones that compete for price


[03-Aug-24 12:51 AM] marat_sh#0000
The way to fix it I think would be Holding goods you are trying to sell on CX in your storage and not Ether


[03-Aug-24 12:52 AM] tanda#0000
I do do that! I love my sidepipe sponsored spreadsheet showing my instocks


[03-Aug-24 12:52 AM] realharvey#0000
Stockpiling does not generate revenue and slows down your expansion :)


[03-Aug-24 12:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
it slows down everyones expansion Trade is so slow when people just provide for themselves


[03-Aug-24 12:53 AM] marat_sh#0000
That spreadsheet is so good


[03-Aug-24 01:06 AM] marat_sh#0000
Imagine the world where people are forced to sell their goods on CX because they runout of space


[03-Aug-24 04:56 AM] razenpok#0000
Yep, np, I have a buffer for several days


[03-Aug-24 08:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
@avalock how much for AR? üôÇ


[03-Aug-24 08:57 AM] avalock#0000
180/u as per #kevin-operations (i havent checked cx prices tho)


[03-Aug-24 08:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
and would you be able to sell me 582 thereof?


[03-Aug-24 08:57 AM] avalock#0000
i think i have upwards of 2k


[03-Aug-24 08:59 AM] avalock#0000
i‚Äôd have to calculate transport prices tbh since its at KI401d


[03-Aug-24 09:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
Ah, good old KI-401d. I don't mind swinging by and picking it up, especially if anyone else needs stuff taken out there


[03-Aug-24 09:00 AM] avalock#0000
sounds good!


[03-Aug-24 09:01 AM] avalock#0000
maybe i‚Äôll talk about expansion plans in #associate-planning because i would love to make a route that goes Aceland <-> KI-401d


[03-Aug-24 10:28 AM] sidepipe#0000

[03-Aug-24 03:24 PM] jcheung#0000
I don't know why the stupid things default to rat


[03-Aug-24 03:24 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
should be default to empty


[03-Aug-24 03:24 PM] jcheung#0000
There's plenty of other places you have to punch in commodity type that are empty


[03-Aug-24 03:27 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
i hope they fix the contract to have the abilty to have more comoditites per contract

yup


[07-Aug-24 11:16 AM] evany.#0000
that kind of makes sense. but nowhere does it say that


[07-Aug-24 11:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000
if avacyn made a sell contract then you could just pick it up


[07-Aug-24 11:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000
but since you made the buy cont you need a war


[07-Aug-24 11:17 AM] evany.#0000

[07-Aug-24 11:18 AM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah...


[07-Aug-24 11:19 AM] .urpalhal#0000
in sell contracts the seller's inv acts as the buffer

ok cool, i can send 30 cont for both location, your book say 2,500 a piece correct?


[07-Aug-24 07:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
that's the right price! I could bring them to nike. I do need to bring other stuff there


[07-Aug-24 07:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
then it would just be one cont


[07-Aug-24 07:49 PM] nyanism#0000
no need, i dont need them at NIke, but i do have ship inbound/plan to be there, so its an ok-ish pickup

I've got LHP at ANT. I can ship in some SSC but it's all on Proxion right now

How much for LHP? I'll buy SSC from CX probably, they don't cost much

Yeah a cont is fine


[08-Aug-24 09:20 AM] tanda#0000
oof, I'll have to delist that then. AI1 is like 100 below CoGM for me, and thats even just counting my AL as cost


[08-Aug-24 09:34 AM] razenpok#0000
Does it mean lse is underpriced rn? :blobthink:


[08-Aug-24 09:40 AM] tanda#0000
most likely just overproduced for its actual consumption


[08-Aug-24 09:56 AM] realharvey#0000
Do you source AL at those insane CX prices?


[08-Aug-24 09:57 AM] tanda#0000
no, when I decided that price, I used prun planner to figure out the CoGM for my AL. It's like 430/unit


[08-Aug-24 09:57 AM] tanda#0000
the main issue is the PG price


[08-Aug-24 10:01 AM] razenpok#0000
Oof, insane. LSE is one of the most unprofitable recipes in the game rn (in ANT space), according to my estimator. Full LSE base would generate 20k/d total loss.

I can sell at 6k/u and still make enough margin

I don't make my own PG, so I cannot do that


[08-Aug-24 10:08 AM] realharvey#0000
the LSE price is fine. PG is totally overpriced

with all Material from the CX PG is 23/u

and ANT is the cheapest right now. Wow


[08-Aug-24 10:09 AM] realharvey#0000
I dont produce all PG myself (would need 4 bases üòÇ  for all my Demand) So I've set it at 30/u for my internal pricing calculations

Went through and revisited my internal offers in case they were stale data. I think the others are good, though some other people might want to revisit their offers as well due to having razor thin margins

I see that you put it on internal offers for 730 AIC. On the CX there is a buy order for 49375 C


[11-Aug-24 08:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
at 730 AIC


[11-Aug-24 08:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
If you would offer at 10-20% lower then BID order on CX. I am sure you can find some people who would buy your stock


[11-Aug-24 08:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
if not People would just use CX or their own internal suppliers

I was up way too late last night *and* a friend bought me a couple beers and I may have shipped 19k DW to ANT instead of the 3k I wanted to send... It filled almost a whole ship so I don't really want to send it back, lol


[12-Aug-24 09:34 PM] tanda#0000
I will totally take 3k

well, I would but I don't have anything above that on your sheet I'm willing to trade


[12-Aug-24 09:56 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I also added it to my internal offers matching sidepipe at 65/u if that works. And it's actually items *below* it that I trade for. (pretty sure I told you wrong before, I was just looking at direct comparisons on the backend of that list and forgot how I'd set it up üòÖ ) My more acurate original instructions are here: https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1183249045624471582/1206308706468499526


[12-Aug-24 09:57 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

I'd potentially want as much as 6,000, but probably can't afford that much in one go. üòÇ . 
@cptcoleslaw I have 1,300 H that I could trade on a barter basis (which looks like is on your need list), and probably stretch to 300k AIC in cash (in two days). So whatever that will buy I'd probably take off your hands.

I can do 1600 DW for 1300 H, and the other 4400 DW (286k CIS @ 65/u) with a long payment deadline if that helps. As long as you want to set it ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[13-Aug-24 11:03 AM] akyantor#0000
That works. Will be able to do it fairly quickly, but will have to convert the AIC to CIS. I think I should be able to do that easily enough within corp. üôÇ

Mmm. I can back fill Droxx's stuff, I just need details. 

As an actual side note.... You guys should enlist some PRO licensees, who're able/willing to process your commodity transfers... I'm not applying for such a thing....

When 1 person becomes the king-pin of a production organisation, it becomes an easy point of failure... It's best to have backups, in case such things are ever realised.

^ Yep.


[18-Aug-24 03:45 AM] akyantor#0000
If anything it's good to have some demand not go through internal markets, as it ensures the CX remains reflective of the true demand.


[18-Aug-24 04:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You will never have that, since many projects/corporations, have chosen to go through internally structured transfers, rather than letting the CX be the arbitrator of them. It's why I claim many commodities be "surplus markets" since they reflect what some are willing to sell at a given price, but not a good majority.


[18-Aug-24 04:21 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Give me ~50 new bros, and I shall teach them how to engage in CX trading, so that they can thoroughly compete, and offer their surplus at the highest CX bidder. Your CX markets would change after that, your FIO margins would reflect that, and your strategic decisions would be bound by that.... **memes aside**.... you will never have such, since everyone is bound, by the FIO stat?!? (statistics).


[18-Aug-24 04:24 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lets see, 50 newbros, at ~300k AIC farming bases, all around Antares --- huge COGC pressures, decent profitability margins... --- Ok I've had my fun.

hello @tanda !
are your prices updated ? 
whats your current price for mcg ?
 if the balance in your sheet is negative, is it because you don't have stock ?


[20-Aug-24 12:36 PM] jcheung#0000
ANT ask would be... 79/u right now


[20-Aug-24 12:43 PM] laaxus#0000
i'll reiterate my request :
(as soon as I get my grant)
I would be looking for anything in this list,  but from highest priority to lowest :
BBH
BDE
C
PSL
LSE
LDE
MCG
H

A few of us list OVE and PWO, I also have 100 (I think) BBH at the moment, but that could change as I have been using it for repairs


[20-Aug-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
honestly, ove and pwo  is not what I'm looking for right now, as it is kinda peanuts compared to the building production
I'll look into it once it becomes my main expense


[20-Aug-24 12:51 PM] jcheung#0000
i strongly suggest looking at #internal-offers and reaching out to some people


[20-Aug-24 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
mcg you can get for free, C you can probably shave off at least 100/u maybe even 300/u


[20-Aug-24 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah I did, now I'm waiting


[20-Aug-24 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
the one doing mcg for free has no stock IIRC ?

[20-Aug-24 01:57 PM] puncher23#0000
I can do that and have a list as well I think the list would be nice.  Reason being is I can look at a list if I am not able to bring up game at the same time to do that.

hello!
My prices are generally up to date but I may have missed a market trend. Feel free to call it out if I'm not priced competitively to the market.
I don't manufacture MCG, sorry
I forgot to remove some buffers, there is stock available. But yes if it's negative, my stock is below my buffer


[21-Aug-24 02:35 AM] laaxus#0000

Hello


[27-Aug-24 01:22 AM] realmraker#0000
looking for some cheap C , H , CL , O 200 each


[27-Aug-24 01:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm pretty sure @_sashkaa is your man for carbon if you desire something long term


[27-Aug-24 01:27 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm also interested in long term H


[27-Aug-24 04:15 AM] _sashkaa#0000
I think I'm gonna need CRM software at this point üòõ


[27-Aug-24 04:22 AM] realharvey#0000
how much C do you produce and what is your price?


[27-Aug-24 04:22 AM] realharvey#0000
I need 740 Carbon per day. üòÇ


[27-Aug-24 04:41 AM] _sashkaa#0000
Ok, I'm gonna write my own CRM


[27-Aug-24 07:36 AM] chobbycock#0000
What amount of H you looking for and how often?


[27-Aug-24 07:39 AM] laaxus#0000
Around 1k a week for the short term


[27-Aug-24 07:39 AM] chobbycock#0000
Lemme crunch some numbers, gona be setting up a second H farm for my own plans, but might be able to supply you too


[27-Aug-24 07:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm experimenting a few products with my bmp, but pe will always be there


[27-Aug-24 07:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I think 500 a week long term is guaranted


[27-Aug-24 07:40 AM] laaxus#0000
but I can't guarantee the 1.5k of full production


[27-Aug-24 07:41 AM] laaxus#0000
so 1k a week for the next few weeks or so seems good


[27-Aug-24 07:43 AM] chobbycock#0000
Yea I'm looking at an excess of 4k a week currently when I've got everything set up so, I can definetly do that


[27-Aug-24 07:44 AM] chobbycock#0000
Are you ready to take delivery of H right now? Because I have about 12k sitting doing nothing and I can send a ship to go set up my other H farm today


[27-Aug-24 07:45 AM] laaxus#0000
only if you can deliver it to hephaestus


[27-Aug-24 07:45 AM] laaxus#0000
my ships are busy


[27-Aug-24 07:45 AM] laaxus#0000
oh wait i'm dumb ant is ok too, but I prefer hepha if possible


[27-Aug-24 07:46 AM] chobbycock#0000
My current issue is actually shipping it, which is why I have the excess, but I can start moving it to get it to Heph


[27-Aug-24 07:46 AM] laaxus#0000
what would be your price ?


[27-Aug-24 07:48 AM] chobbycock#0000
What about 75/u?


[27-Aug-24 07:48 AM] laaxus#0000
I'll take your entire stock


[27-Aug-24 07:49 AM] laaxus#0000

[27-Aug-24 07:50 AM] chobbycock#0000

[03-Sep-24 09:01 PM] .shiva.#0000
I have the same amount extra at ANT


[03-Sep-24 09:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
Also, 150/u at ANT if anyone needs FLX! Will limit to probably 500 per person until I get more, but hopefully it'll help tide everyone over üôÇ

drat, I really need to drop another CHP base one of these days


[03-Sep-24 09:04 PM] tanda#0000
I wonder what price FLX has to be to make Original Recipe Aluminum more profitable


[03-Sep-24 09:57 PM] .shiva.#0000
~517 if I did the math right, with current prices for alo/c/o


[03-Sep-24 10:10 PM] tanda#0000

dont know exactly where to put this so ill put this here. 

Hello all! i am currently hiring for a CX trading position (not inter CX!). you do not need much prior experience or any capital, just a willingness to learn and some time. we reccomend this for newer players, who have a bit more time on their hands because it is rather active. pay is good, DM me if youre interested for the position! (we will provide money to trade with, tools to find the best trades, training, everything)

[08-Sep-24 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
was debating bringing like 200 AL to sell


[08-Sep-24 05:53 PM] jcheung#0000
this is much better though, because it lets me clear out my nike WAR


[08-Sep-24 05:53 PM] jcheung#0000
just to confirm only 900?


[08-Sep-24 05:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
yup üôÇ


[08-Sep-24 05:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's _almost_ 2 weeks worth of AL


[08-Sep-24 05:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
so I only have to run one ship out there when I stop slacking and resupply Nike


[08-Sep-24 05:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
do you need ICA, btw?


[08-Sep-24 05:55 PM] jcheung#0000

[09-Sep-24 06:29 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Slowly depleting, im lining up to dismantle my AL bases


[09-Sep-24 06:29 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
To replace with what?


[09-Sep-24 06:30 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Any AL still up for sale?


[09-Sep-24 07:01 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I could sell 76, it's mainly there for ship repairs but I can get more from Hephaestus (or sell some there if that's better)


[09-Sep-24 07:05 AM] tanda#0000
@finestone Sorry for rejecting that contract, but I am currently tapped on AL


[09-Sep-24 07:06 AM] laaxus#0000
I would like to buy it on heph
How many per day would you sell ?
I'd like to buy 500 MFK if possible


[09-Sep-24 07:08 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Higher tier stuff my 3 permits dedicated to ALO/AL are making a total of 110k/day. No sense keeping at it when my next permit is 10mil


[09-Sep-24 07:10 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Or get a single month of pro and upgrade your base as much as you can afford to receive extra permits


[09-Sep-24 07:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yes, but it might take a few days - everything is still at Nike atm. Have 5k


[09-Sep-24 07:12 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im already pro. My point is more that I have much more profitable things I can do with the permits


[09-Sep-24 07:13 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im at 22 bases


[09-Sep-24 07:14 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Oh lmao, sorry. When you said 3 I assumed you meant you had max 3


[09-Sep-24 07:14 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
No worries


[09-Sep-24 07:14 AM] laaxus#0000
I would like to buy the 5k if thats ok with you 
(Maybe not in one time because I don't have the cash for it)


[09-Sep-24 07:15 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Anyways, what the quantity of AL you have for sale, if any


[09-Sep-24 07:15 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yup, go for it - you can just do a 14 day deadline on payment. I take credit üòÅ


[09-Sep-24 07:15 AM] laaxus#0000
well, that would help üòÖ


[09-Sep-24 07:16 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
480 on its way to Ant and about 700 on Vulcan


[09-Sep-24 07:18 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I can take all 480 of your hands, I'll send you a CONT now for a 3d deadline?


[09-Sep-24 07:20 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Actually, I'll take the 700 on Vulcan while I'm at it too, why not. Deliverable to ANT with a 14d deadline?

[09-Sep-24 09:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yup, unless you wanna get it off the FX at like 1.01:1 - seems like a lot of people are selling NCC, but very few buying


[09-Sep-24 09:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
Actually full disclosure, you might be able to get more than 1 NCC per AIC on the FX if you shop around


[09-Sep-24 09:28 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Sent contacts 
I think I'm stupid because I just can't figure out the FXOB. I had listed AIC for 1 and I could see there were sellers listing NCC for <0.99


[09-Sep-24 09:29 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
And yet my buy order wouldn't go through


[09-Sep-24 09:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
You‚Äôre not stupid, the FX is just weird. I think it‚Äôll only fill one order at a time, so even if there‚Äôs 5 orders that could fill yours it‚Äôll do the first and stop


[09-Sep-24 09:31 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôd try and get some screenshots if I was at my PC

@laaxus Do you have EXO in stock?


[09-Sep-24 11:02 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am gonna try to keep EXO prices from surging above 260/u


[09-Sep-24 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
I had 500 of them in stock but sold them around  days ago


[09-Sep-24 11:04 AM] marat_sh#0000
Someone bough a lot on CX


[09-Sep-24 11:04 AM] marat_sh#0000
I have a few left but no production currently


[09-Sep-24 11:06 AM] laaxus#0000
I would produce EXO for 270, but not for 260


[09-Sep-24 11:07 AM] marat_sh#0000
works for me. Next big ASK is at 288/u


[09-Sep-24 11:09 AM] laaxus#0000
This happens 24h after I sold the stock of AL I had


[09-Sep-24 11:10 AM] marat_sh#0000
Prefect timing as usual üòÖ


[09-Sep-24 11:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
while we were talking some bought the rest up to 288/u


[09-Sep-24 11:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
I've listed my last EXO for 270


[09-Sep-24 11:13 AM] laaxus#0000
and I'm 100% sure everybody sold all their stock of AL yesterday, so no more AL in internal trading


[09-Sep-24 11:13 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm switching my deimos base to full AL production


[09-Sep-24 11:14 AM] marat_sh#0000
I've put a bid of 100 for 750/u AL


[09-Sep-24 11:14 AM] marat_sh#0000
let's see if it's gonna get filled


[09-Sep-24 11:15 AM] marat_sh#0000
if it's not gonna get filled I would just buy like 50 AL to make 500 EXO for now


[09-Sep-24 11:16 AM] igfloz#0000
jeez, and there's me selling EXO internally for 180 üòõ - I might have some AL lying around


[09-Sep-24 11:17 AM] marat_sh#0000
internal items are awesome but I do feel bad for screwing people over


[09-Sep-24 11:17 AM] igfloz#0000
thats fair


[09-Sep-24 11:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
If you have some EXO in stock we can keep the prices for EXO under control


[09-Sep-24 11:18 AM] igfloz#0000
I have 500 AL spare on Hephaestus if it helps ?


[09-Sep-24 11:18 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah I can buy 200 AL if it's in Heph


[09-Sep-24 11:18 AM] laaxus#0000
It helps a fuck ton ?


[09-Sep-24 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
at what rate would you sell them ?


[09-Sep-24 11:19 AM] igfloz#0000

I'm 100% sure than STR has market potential


[10-Sep-24 09:36 AM] laaxus#0000
As it's cheaper to produce than tub


[10-Sep-24 09:36 AM] marat_sh#0000
Not really... STR are niche... They are only useful for low lvl inf when you don't have upgrades yet


[10-Sep-24 09:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
but they are very expancive for what they provide


[10-Sep-24 09:41 AM] laaxus#0000
Still less expensive than tub


[10-Sep-24 10:12 AM] realharvey#0000
You only need one building for tub. It also doesn't really sell. I tried it. At current CX rates tub doesnt really sell


[10-Sep-24 10:14 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, that's what I learned


[10-Sep-24 10:15 AM] laaxus#0000
people would rather produce themselves and eat the cost of opportunity


[10-Sep-24 10:15 AM] laaxus#0000
rather than producing something else and buy from the market

"risk management"


[10-Sep-24 10:38 AM] realharvey#0000
When it comes to feeding popi there are usually cheaper alternatives as well. So using expensive tub is just throwing money out the window. Same with STR. You usually don't use it and rather upgrade popi so you can use DW

[10-Sep-24 10:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
Fully staffed/upgraded POPI are meant for massive population... but if you have small population, upgraded POPI can provide with just one input filled


[10-Sep-24 10:45 AM] realharvey#0000
Yes sorry :D


[10-Sep-24 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
and here goes my str business plan


[10-Sep-24 10:46 AM] marat_sh#0000
there are some uses but People would rather wait and upgrade the building then spend that money for temp solution (STR and TUB)


[10-Sep-24 10:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
in other hand if POPI building would have required all inputs to operate... we would have a very different economy


[10-Sep-24 10:53 AM] realharvey#0000
Str and tub are only a thing on bigger planets. Those are run by more experienced players. And they dont like those high margins on the CX on cheap to produce goods


[10-Sep-24 10:53 AM] realharvey#0000
So they source it somewhere else

[11-Sep-24 11:03 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
anyone know why the the trading station for deimos isn't filling orders when i price things in the green?


[11-Sep-24 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
The CX- Commodity Exchange isn't on Deimos, it's a space station the Antares I system, one jump away from Deimos. There is a local market on Deimos, but that operates differently from what you are describing.


[11-Sep-24 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
You will want to check your warehouse on ANT, and if you don't have one yet, you will want to rent one. If you bought things and didn't have a warehouse, they will be waiting for pickup in your contracts tab


[11-Sep-24 11:22 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
i was referring to the station but i couldn't remember how to spell the system name lol


[11-Sep-24 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
You will also want to check out a video tutorial explaining this


[11-Sep-24 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh üôÇ


[11-Sep-24 11:22 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
i do have a warehouse but the things i order just go to pending and don't get filled


[11-Sep-24 11:22 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
they don't go to the warehouse or ship cargo


[11-Sep-24 11:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
What did you order?


[11-Sep-24 11:23 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
the orders just sit on pending


[11-Sep-24 11:24 AM] igfloz#0000
If you are buying "green" items, you are placing a bid, another player will have to sell at that bid price. All the "red" orders are sale items (hence the higher price)


[11-Sep-24 11:24 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
oxygen, carbon, basic overalls, in general supplies i need for my facilities due to running metallurgy


[11-Sep-24 11:25 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
ok but aren't the "red" prices also a set price to go under due to the expense when you need more then one?


[11-Sep-24 11:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
The red prices- the higher ones- are people offering to sell something. If you pay the higher price, you get the item right away. If you enter a "request" - the lower green numbers  - someone might fill those later


[11-Sep-24 11:26 AM] igfloz#0000
Err, you would sell at a cheaper "red" price, not buy


[11-Sep-24 11:26 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
and i'm in need of oxygen and carbon as i'm fully out and i still have a bit of iron ore to process aside from needing to process aluminum ore


[11-Sep-24 11:28 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
and the "red" prices are higher then what i can afford right now due to wanting to get at least i'd say 10 units of each to start with


[11-Sep-24 11:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't see any open orders from you on O or C or OVE (at least not named Chris Walters).


[11-Sep-24 11:29 AM] igfloz#0000
I can help you out with OVE and PWO - I don't stock the other ingredient items sorry


[11-Sep-24 11:29 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
i have to fix my tag again


[11-Sep-24 11:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
So if you put in orders, you should check your `CONT`  buffer to see if they got filled and are waiting


[11-Sep-24 11:29 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
Delta38 is my tag in game

[11-Sep-24 11:30 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
yes that's me


[11-Sep-24 11:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay so you can buy up to 4610 OVE immediately from Skyprod at 120/u


[11-Sep-24 11:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
You put in a bid for 50 OVE at 100/u


[11-Sep-24 11:31 AM] archielvahr#0000
But someone can only sell to the highest priced bid. So someone has to fill Entropy's order for 610 OVE at 109 first.. then everyone else above you. And then fill your order


[11-Sep-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
So you can cancel your orders for free via the `CXOS` buffer, you'll get your money back


[11-Sep-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
Then buy a smaller amount at 120


[11-Sep-24 11:34 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
ok i'll do that after class


[11-Sep-24 11:36 AM] jcheung#0000
"green" means cheap to sell, but you wait to buy
"red" means expensive to buy, but you wait to sell

[11-Sep-24 08:10 PM] jcheung#0000
i can probably expedite a trip to BEN. i do have 1k HE sitting there for the last 2 months that i should probably do something with


[11-Sep-24 08:11 PM] tanda#0000
alright, that's a bit easier, I have a CIS supplier


[11-Sep-24 08:11 PM] tanda#0000

when things are marked to go to the warehouse when orders are filled but they aren't there where did they go? as i just had a few orders filled and marked to go to my warehouse but there's nothing there


[12-Sep-24 09:34 AM] jcheung#0000
what do you mean marked to go to WAR


[12-Sep-24 09:34 AM] jcheung#0000
i don't recall seeing a setting to do that


[12-Sep-24 09:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
Check your contracts - that‚Äôs where they‚Äôll go if you don‚Äôt have enough space when you buy at the CX


[12-Sep-24 09:35 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
ok


[12-Sep-24 09:36 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
just looked there's nothing aside from in the trading panel the orders being marked as filled


[12-Sep-24 09:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
Could you share a screenshot of your CXOS panel?


[12-Sep-24 09:37 AM] sidepipe#0000

[12-Sep-24 09:57 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
that's what i'm looking at


[12-Sep-24 09:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
And if you click ‚Äòopen store‚Äô in that warehouse storage tab, do you see it there?


[12-Sep-24 09:58 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
let me look


[12-Sep-24 09:58 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
they're there didn't know that was there as it was showing greyed out until i hovered over it


[12-Sep-24 09:59 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, it‚Äôs a little counterintuitive until you‚Äôve spent some time with all these screens üòÑ


[12-Sep-24 10:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
But the WAR screen is how you manage how many warehouses you have at the station - you can open an INV buffer to look at all the different inventories with less clicking


[12-Sep-24 10:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
To be clear, if you click the gear in the top right of any of those tabs, it‚Äôll open a little command bar where you can enter these different abbreviations like ‚ÄúINV‚Äù, ‚ÄúCXOS‚Äù, and so on


[12-Sep-24 10:03 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôd send you some screenshots, but I‚Äôm stuck on my phone right now


[12-Sep-24 10:09 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
ok


[12-Sep-24 10:39 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
so how does someone with a free account request funding to order parts and supplies?


[12-Sep-24 10:41 AM] flor2081#0000
if you can find a market ticker that is very easily bought out, you can buy it out, relist all the stuff way above the limit, and the other person will buy that


[12-Sep-24 10:41 AM] flor2081#0000
and you can do that a couple of times, the other person will relist low again, you buy low and sell high


[12-Sep-24 10:41 AM] flor2081#0000
it's a bit of a pain, mostly because you have to find such an easily manipulated item first


[12-Sep-24 10:41 AM] flor2081#0000
let me see if i can find one


[12-Sep-24 10:42 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
well i have about 16-18 iron on the way to the station right now


[12-Sep-24 10:42 AM] flor2081#0000
oh wait you're not talking about trading money, just selling normally?


[12-Sep-24 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
you just need an item that has no ask order


[12-Sep-24 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
i can find you plenty


[12-Sep-24 10:43 AM] flor2081#0000
not none


[12-Sep-24 10:43 AM] flor2081#0000
but yeah


[12-Sep-24 10:44 AM] flor2081#0000
RSI.AI1 for example


[12-Sep-24 10:44 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
well either one but in general i had seen a thing in game chat about funding being provided if needed and that's what i was wondering about


[12-Sep-24 10:44 AM] flor2081#0000
ah yeah that what i said


[12-Sep-24 10:44 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
though i haven't seen any iron in the station inv for sale though


[12-Sep-24 10:45 AM] flor2081#0000
you can check that with the command `CXOB FE.AI1`


[12-Sep-24 10:46 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
don't mind that i just saw the metals tab and looked there and saw that the running rate for iron is about 740 credits


[12-Sep-24 10:46 AM] flor2081#0000
yup exactly (:


[12-Sep-24 10:47 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
though what i should sell mine for i don't know yet


[12-Sep-24 10:47 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
as i don't have much


[12-Sep-24 10:47 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
i was thinking either 745 or 750


[12-Sep-24 10:47 AM] flor2081#0000
best to make your order at the lowest sell price, so that it will be filled first

[12-Sep-24 10:47 AM] flor2081#0000
so right now, if you sell at 774, your order will be filled first


[12-Sep-24 10:48 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
ok


[12-Sep-24 10:48 AM] flor2081#0000
i'm not too familiar with the metal markets, but it shouldnt take too long to fill


[12-Sep-24 10:49 AM] flor2081#0000
just take note that you may be undercut occasionally if you put the price too high


[12-Sep-24 10:49 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
i'm shipping out 18 units of iron


[12-Sep-24 10:49 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
do you think that 750 is too low of a sell price?


[12-Sep-24 10:50 AM] flor2081#0000
uh, nah i think thats good


[12-Sep-24 10:50 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
ok


[12-Sep-24 10:50 AM] flor2081#0000
its higher than the other stations


[12-Sep-24 10:50 AM] chriswalters0326#0000
oh?


[12-Sep-24 10:51 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah moria and hortus both sell at 630-650 so ant is looking pretty good for you atm

[13-Sep-24 11:58 AM] laaxus#0000
No, I have to supply my base anyway, so I send a LCB about every 2 day


[13-Sep-24 11:59 AM] laaxus#0000
it's just that this time, I could help the money of the base to pay for the inputs


[13-Sep-24 12:03 PM] razenpok#0000
@jvaler what do you think about adding a "Pay what you want, unless fare rate is stated by a shipper" bullet point to the sticky message of #shipping ?


[13-Sep-24 12:03 PM] razenpok#0000
As far as I can see, most people don't care much about fare rate or flat-out provide shipping for free


[13-Sep-24 01:08 PM] razenpok#0000
btw wtf how do you have an LCB already


[13-Sep-24 01:09 PM] laaxus#0000
isn't the LCB the 3000/1000 ?

@cptcoleslaw how many mfk do you have ? i'd like to buy around 500


[15-Sep-24 01:55 PM] tanda#0000
@laaxus I can't fulfill on that Carbon contract, your storage is too full


[15-Sep-24 02:00 PM] tanda#0000
hey sir, do you know how far out this shipment is?


[15-Sep-24 02:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Around day, day and half. Was delayed on outbound leg, apologies


[15-Sep-24 02:04 PM] tanda#0000
no worries! just trying to plan bases dropping

It's restocking time for my bases and my ships are busy. I'm about to go nuts with shipping contracts to the local area, all starting from ANT


[15-Sep-24 04:18 PM] laaxus#0000
Make sure to do 400T contract and not 500


[15-Sep-24 04:19 PM] laaxus#0000
I do many almost empty Travel, but I still need Space to bring my stuff


[15-Sep-24 04:19 PM] tanda#0000
it's going to be a bunch of odd sized contracts, I only send enough RAT/DW/COF to last for a month, so most will be quite small


[15-Sep-24 04:40 PM] tanda#0000
alright, something like 40 different shipping contracts posted going everywhere from Nike/Nike JR, to Deimos, to Harmonia/Nascent and some even to Elon


[15-Sep-24 04:40 PM] tanda#0000
I think I currently make up the bulk of all LM contracts in the Antares region


[15-Sep-24 04:44 PM] jcheung#0000
all from nike?


[15-Sep-24 04:45 PM] jcheung#0000
anything going to nike?


[15-Sep-24 04:45 PM] tanda#0000
on the ANT LM. There's two sets for the Nike system, one for Nike and one for Nike JR


[15-Sep-24 04:46 PM] jcheung#0000
ah


[15-Sep-24 04:46 PM] tanda#0000
should be able to fit both on 3kt


[15-Sep-24 04:46 PM] tanda#0000
if you're looking to haul off of Nike, I do have some INS to ship back


[15-Sep-24 04:47 PM] jcheung#0000
i should really look at it now but i'm freakin exhausted


[15-Sep-24 04:47 PM] jcheung#0000
so i bet a lot of these will be gone by the time i've taken a nap


[15-Sep-24 04:47 PM] tanda#0000
probably, but I think Nike/Nike JR/Elon will be the last to go, since they're not common new player destinations


[15-Sep-24 04:50 PM] razenpok#0000

where's your usual bulk shipping to/from?


[15-Sep-24 04:52 PM] igfloz#0000
@tanda  I read you are doing a 30 day stock fill. Just so you are aware, my current offers for OVE, PWO & EXO are a bit low (especially EXO) - I'm bringing more in from Heph tonight


[15-Sep-24 04:52 PM] tanda#0000
the usual shipping routes for our area:
ANT>Harmonia>Nascent>Ant
ANT>Deimos>Nike JR/Aceland>ANT
ANT>Hephaestus>Aceland>ANT


[15-Sep-24 04:53 PM] jcheung#0000
anything going now from deimos > nike/nikejr?


[15-Sep-24 04:53 PM] tanda#0000

i think something like 700m3 open once i finish dropping stuff at deimos


[15-Sep-24 05:00 PM] jcheung#0000
anyhow. will drop those off sometime tomorrow


[15-Sep-24 05:01 PM] tanda#0000
I appreciate it!


[15-Sep-24 05:01 PM] jcheung#0000
any of these really strongly benefit from a LCB?


[15-Sep-24 05:02 PM] tanda#0000
LCB would help me a lot in Thalassa. currently I have to tie up a WCB in that system that could be used elsewhere


[15-Sep-24 05:11 PM] jcheung#0000
that's the water one right?


[15-Sep-24 05:11 PM] jcheung#0000
hmmmm


[15-Sep-24 05:11 PM] jcheung#0000
how frequent and is it just in-system?


[15-Sep-24 05:12 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, it's just in system. route for that one would be ISA>B>A>ISA with occassional trips to ANT


[15-Sep-24 05:12 PM] tanda#0000
but it's a lot of finicky work and high volume


[15-Sep-24 05:16 PM] jcheung#0000
hrm


[15-Sep-24 05:16 PM] jcheung#0000
that's tricky


[15-Sep-24 05:16 PM] jcheung#0000
how much time does one loop around take?


[15-Sep-24 05:17 PM] tanda#0000
12 hours starting from in system with decent planet placement?


[15-Sep-24 05:17 PM] tanda#0000
transit times are like 2-3 hours


[15-Sep-24 05:17 PM] jcheung#0000
hrm


[15-Sep-24 05:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
STL ship time? üòÑ


[15-Sep-24 05:18 PM] tanda#0000
tiny system is tiny!


[15-Sep-24 05:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
I run a GEN 500/500 ship in the system - it mostly just goes between A and B


[15-Sep-24 05:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
And I bring in an LCB about once a week to stop at ISA, bring water to B, and take RATs out


[15-Sep-24 05:19 PM] tanda#0000
My initial plan for that system was for an STL ship, main issue is it's kinda dumb for me to get a niche ship as my third ship


[15-Sep-24 05:19 PM] tanda#0000
so I'll bump that down the line for my 5th or so


[15-Sep-24 05:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
Think of it as your 2.5nd ship üòÅ


[15-Sep-24 05:19 PM] jcheung#0000
how often do you need a ship to make that loop? ü§î


[15-Sep-24 05:20 PM] jcheung#0000
and more importantly, do you have enough storage to have said loop be delayed any


[15-Sep-24 05:21 PM] tanda#0000
currently my buffers and storage are such that I can ignore the system for about 5 days. I need to make a slight tweak to B (add one HYF, and one more STO, and change what HABs are there)


[15-Sep-24 05:22 PM] tanda#0000
then I can probably not need to worry about it for 10 days or so. HYFs are very water hungry


[15-Sep-24 05:23 PM] jcheung#0000
i think i could swing by once a week, yeah. when's the next one due?


[15-Sep-24 05:24 PM] tanda#0000
now, lol. I have a WCB in route to take care of it

[15-Sep-24 05:24 PM] tanda#0000
I'll try to coordinate with you until I get the LCB


[15-Sep-24 05:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
If you run into any issues and @jcheung can‚Äôt ship something, let me know - I usually have an LCB near ANT


[15-Sep-24 05:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
So I can be backup for the backup üòÅ

Do you know anyone with a significant amount of Rfabs?


[16-Sep-24 07:13 AM] realharvey#0000
internal demand for all Fabs are higher than what is being produced


[16-Sep-24 07:13 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, it's another build cycle again. I could self supply BFAB and LFAB but not R or A


[16-Sep-24 07:23 AM] jvaler#0000
internal rfabs always seem to be a struggle, both here and in AA lol


[16-Sep-24 07:24 AM] jvaler#0000
so i dunno


[16-Sep-24 07:27 AM] realharvey#0000
another issue is that "keeping stock" also means having a lot of sitting capital that is not liquid and cant be used for expansion


[16-Sep-24 07:27 AM] realharvey#0000
and people usually want to buy a lot of fabs at a time


[16-Sep-24 08:33 AM] jcheung#0000
i think some people think charging works like it does on the Destiny (stargate), or lethal company


[16-Sep-24 08:46 AM] razenpok#0000

[16-Sep-24 09:05 PM] tanda#0000

it would be miraculous on many fronts if that was inaccurate

I‚Äôll see if I can get some there


[19-Sep-24 11:53 AM] realharvey#0000
is rise buying all your HAL?


[19-Sep-24 11:53 AM] realharvey#0000
or is it just shipping problem?


[19-Sep-24 11:53 AM] .urpalhal#0000
No not rise but like everyone


[19-Sep-24 12:02 PM] .shiva.#0000
Hey, you have any `BGS` laying around? I've got a ship construction contract to do...


[19-Sep-24 12:03 PM] evov#0000
Nah, I never really found the appeal for those tbh.


[19-Sep-24 12:06 PM] evov#0000
I just stick to FSE/QCR and rarely find myself wanting to push the FTL slider too high. So a lot of those nice boosty type addons just don't make sense imo


[19-Sep-24 12:06 PM] .shiva.#0000
Theyre mostly free with the contract is all lol


[19-Sep-24 12:06 PM] evov#0000
Sorry, but no. Don't make them. Don't even have the building that makes them üôÇ


[19-Sep-24 12:06 PM] .shiva.#0000
Yeah no worries


[19-Sep-24 12:07 PM] .shiva.#0000
None for sale in the universe atm


[19-Sep-24 12:09 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah BGS needs a higher power engine to actually have any effect. my upgraded WCBs that have ENG actually get a marginal boost out of them, but my constructed WCBs that use FSEs get literally 0 benefit


[19-Sep-24 12:11 PM] evov#0000
Yea, there's a stack of juicy options out there for people that want to go fast. But there's a meaningful increase in fuel cost when you want to go fast, and increase in cost to buy the ship... that's only useful when you... you know, wanna go faaaaaast.


[19-Sep-24 12:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs why I have exactly one LCB with HYR - sometimes you wanna be at Etherwind in 12 hours üòÑ

anyone have b-fabs, lse, lta in stock?

I probably do, how much do you need?

Don't have lse, or much lta. Have a lot of bbh / bse

(Yes, I have STL fleets at all CXs).


[20-Sep-24 02:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
They're getting upgraded too, I just don't have access to FSE engines, since my shipbuilding is 'qued for quite some time.

i feel like that's a given though?


[20-Sep-24 02:23 PM] razenpok#0000
idk, people here tend to ask about fare price a lot


[20-Sep-24 02:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd say... Get your interfaces in order... You'll do less harm to a shipper, if you've got your I/Os in order, and know what you want to get shipped in, beyond basic fuel costs, per week.


[20-Sep-24 02:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I used to pay out 20 - 25k creds, per 500 t/m3 shipped privately... These days I've just upgraded my fleets, as shippers became inefficient, or untrustworthy.

Now... This would be the question to ask......

Cost/ROI ratios of settling against COGC benefits on MCG-only worlds..... Versus settling on pro-COGC worlds, with harsh conditions?


[20-Sep-24 03:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
1) Cost-benefit ratios, seeking to maximize production, against installation/run costs
2) Forming the greater political landscape, of what group needs what & where.

[20-Sep-24 03:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
THE gateways.... will still need to be built.


[20-Sep-24 03:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Assume current metas.


[20-Sep-24 03:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[20-Sep-24 03:18 PM] kynadre#0000
CF is for the "anti-hot" building material that every building needs on hot planets, but I see you're saying demand for that goes down if people can just shortcut to planets that are good and don't need it

TSH is in short supply. Enough supply would decrease the price, and make it more in demand as people would consider the planets that need it more

[20-Sep-24 09:00 PM] evov#0000
CF is one of those ship building things where . . . if it gets cheap enough I'll buy some from the market and use the smelters to make something else.... but traditionally the market hasn't been stable enough to rely on it, so inhouse production is required.

we are due for POPR soon, but I think the critical things may miss.
1) I'm not going to be elected Governor before POPR, so programs will hit the POPR after
2) SST is only going to bump happiness slightly, since it's a 5 week average


[20-Sep-24 09:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Not far off from IRL


[20-Sep-24 09:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But you would think adding some FLX would make more SI not just faster


[20-Sep-24 09:35 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, it really shaves down the profit. On the other hand is the AL recipe, which speeds up the basic recipe by 30 minutes and only uses 1/3 of a unit of O, C, and FLX respectively

How can we twist their arms for some balancing


[20-Sep-24 09:40 PM] evov#0000
I'm guessing it makes a difference if AL is trading at 700/u vs 1000/u though right?


[20-Sep-24 09:40 PM] tanda#0000
given the issues we're seeing with ~~O and~~ FLX currently not so much?


[20-Sep-24 09:41 PM] tanda#0000
but eventually sure


[20-Sep-24 09:43 PM] evov#0000
Out of curiosity, what's the standard pricing model most people use on prunplaner for the cost of their inputs?


[20-Sep-24 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
I run AI1 ASK:ASK


[20-Sep-24 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
because I run mostly vertical integration with a few outputs that I do not sell to bid


[20-Sep-24 09:47 PM] evov#0000
Is that for the cost of your inputs as well?


[20-Sep-24 09:50 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I don't do a lot of custom pricing on PRUN planner (unless I'm trying to find favorable internal prices)


[20-Sep-24 09:52 PM] jvaler#0000
i used to also do ask/ask but now that i remembered 7d/30d averages got added i use those


[20-Sep-24 09:53 PM] jvaler#0000
stuff getting spiked high for a short time would throw off your numbers surprisingly often


[20-Sep-24 09:53 PM] evov#0000
Yea... it was more the.... I wonder how many people are using the time average numbers vs current pricing. If most people are typically using the 30day average, it might take a while for people / the market to adjust to "bumps"


[20-Sep-24 09:54 PM] jvaler#0000
yea 30d is too long imo


[20-Sep-24 09:54 PM] jvaler#0000
so i use 7d


[20-Sep-24 09:55 PM] evov#0000
Which one does it default to if you don't select anything?


[20-Sep-24 09:56 PM] jvaler#0000
afaik it just doesn't work if you don't select anything? unless it's been changed


[20-Sep-24 10:01 PM] evov#0000
Seems like it's a tool that most people use as their primary source of information to decide what to build/where to build it. I'm not fond of a black box spitting out an answer to me without knowing the specifics of how it was worked out.

[20-Sep-24 10:01 PM] kynadre#0000
That and it's also used for hot planet build material... so +SI -> CF, then +TSH, then a fuel base after that maybe, are my plans


[20-Sep-24 10:01 PM] tanda#0000
don't worry, I do check in game too


[20-Sep-24 10:02 PM] tanda#0000
though that check is generally if something is super low or super high or I'm skeptical about traded volume

[20-Sep-24 10:15 PM] jvaler#0000
i feel like having it choose a setting for you would be more black box-ish than it needing your input to work


[20-Sep-24 10:18 PM] evov#0000
For sure. It's just generally not a tool I use so I'm curious how other people use it etc.


[20-Sep-24 10:19 PM] jvaler#0000
makes sense


[20-Sep-24 10:21 PM] evov#0000
Mostly around the 7day/30day pricing models and how many people use them / for what etc.


[20-Sep-24 10:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
all of my inputs in PrUn planner are set to specific prices for buy and sometimes sell (depending on the item)


[20-Sep-24 10:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
I like the 30 day pricing models personally - not for deciding to build a base, but for evaluating the bases I have


[20-Sep-24 10:32 PM] .shiva.#0000
7/30day rolling for both is the way to go imo


[20-Sep-24 10:32 PM] .shiva.#0000
just assume that it's a bit better or worse depending on if you're doing buy / sell orders


[20-Sep-24 10:32 PM] .shiva.#0000
but doesn't get way messed up like just bid/ask can

{Reactions}

[20-Sep-24 10:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
and handles internal profit well, since if you have a base making rat and a base consuming rat, they buy and sell at the same price üôÇ

[21-Sep-24 04:08 PM] firemonkeh#0000
So I'm new to PrUn but is it quite normal then to establish like a contract or something to sell your stuff reliably?


[21-Sep-24 04:09 PM] realharvey#0000
i send 3 contracts for stock that you are about to produce


[21-Sep-24 04:09 PM] realharvey#0000

[21-Sep-24 04:41 PM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend not giving internal offers


[21-Sep-24 04:41 PM] laaxus#0000
but rather, focus on your growth


[21-Sep-24 04:42 PM] laaxus#0000
you only have one base, you can't afford to make low profit offers


[21-Sep-24 04:43 PM] laaxus#0000

@firemonkeh i already sell both PE & MCG far below market (6.5/u and free, respectively)

go ahead and just sell what you make to the CX, it's more important that you grow than for you to subsidize others right now

arriving at ZV-759 within 24hr, 
then heading ZV-307 as soon as someone needs me to if they fill me up, or a week from now roughly about 500/500 available

[21-Sep-24 09:59 PM] kynadre#0000
how soon do you need it to be to ANT central? I was going to stop by ZV-194c for my stuff on the way to ANT anyway unless someone wanted to fill me up and have me go direct or had enough for me to make a full trip there (and bring stuff back)

[22-Sep-24 03:15 PM] laaxus#0000
How did you get those numbers ?
For a full sme base, LI at 1400 makes 70k of profit a day
Don't you make more than that per base in average ?
Or do you value that much the stability of your input prices ?


[22-Sep-24 03:17 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I find the concept of "profit per base" as a threshold to making a base to be a toxic mentality, if a common and low hanging fruit one


[22-Sep-24 03:17 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Dont confuse that with wanting bases to obviously be profitable, and if someone is obviously selling well below market, then yolo, buy it and use it


[22-Sep-24 03:18 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I value reliable and steady supply, consistent stock, and predictable growth and consider them to be much better priorities when making deals and bases.


[22-Sep-24 03:19 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I think chasing recipes and making bases based on what brings in the largest number on paper only works in a perfect steady state economy that can absorb any supply of what you are trying to make, without any influence from other people in the market, which is flatly idiotic and short sighted.

{Reactions}
üëè 

[22-Sep-24 03:25 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Depending on the item, many of which I use that are not super common and lack throughput/velocity on market, someone making a dedicated base, on paper could reap significant income, but I will price is aggressively to a 40-50k/day profit margin, which some folks balk at. But when I make such a request for a dedicated base, I buy the entire output at a fixed price, always. If they were to make that same base and just put that output on market, it wouldnt move, they wouldnt be able to sell all the output, and the likely the price would crash if they tried, and all their "on paper" profits would go to shit.

What should I focus on more, from your opinion ?


[22-Sep-24 03:32 PM] riseoffilth#0000
To be clear, there is nothing wrong with chasing profit. My problem comes when people IGNORE the recipes and vertical integration of industry, and ignore the logistical supply lines, in favor of short bursts of profit in a specific and small industry.


[22-Sep-24 03:34 PM] riseoffilth#0000
It would be like someone seeing and saying, "OH MAN THE PRICE OF SOI IS SO GOOD RIGHT NOW, LET ME SWTICH 2 BASES OVER"


[22-Sep-24 03:34 PM] riseoffilth#0000

LI - Yes, used in ship building. Ship building has near zero impact on the price though. Mostly it's an MM product. If the price is right - I'll buy a heap off you Rise (though for various reasons, my AIC cash reserves will be low for a little while)

Laaxus - Assuming your priority is growth ( make more stuff more faster ) - below 20 permits, focus on RoI. Above 20 permits focus on $/Area/Day.

That's still ROI. Below 20, you're thus incentivized to multipermit profitable industries. After that, you'll looking to minimise cost, exploit as many MCG (triple green), worlds as possible, and up-tier to higher chains within your operational preferences?

[22-Sep-24 05:55 PM] evov#0000
Yes, when people talk about MM's - most of the time, they're talking about fixed prices on the CX markets that you can sell into. So there's zero limit on demand... you can make as much stuff as you want, and you keep getting that price for the item (as a minimum... some items have an MM price, but the market pays more for it, or it costs more to make etc etc)

e.g. CBL. Infinite demand at 91k

IDC, EDC, CBS/CBM/CBL are (in my opinion) the most common/popular MM options.

I mean, if one of the goals was trying to make AL smelting a reasonable option again... not sure if removing ALO availability would help.


[22-Sep-24 06:32 PM] jcheung#0000
it would certainly make AL prices go up


[22-Sep-24 06:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think people are generally more happy with demand-side adjustments than supply-side adjustments üòÑ


[22-Sep-24 06:34 PM] evov#0000
Which - if trying to squeeze the market to make $ was the goal... then yes, yes I would have.


[22-Sep-24 06:34 PM] sidepipe#0000

Do we have anyone with a steady supply available of water on Harmonia?
Thinking of scrapping my rigs, but only if i can get water without having to ship it.


[24-Sep-24 03:41 AM] laaxus#0000
from what I understand, you have a full base ?


[24-Sep-24 03:41 AM] laaxus#0000
if so


[24-Sep-24 03:42 AM] laaxus#0000
you then have your first money printer, congrats !


[24-Sep-24 03:42 AM] laaxus#0000
you should now let your money printer print money, and focus on building another, better, money printer aka another base


[24-Sep-24 03:43 AM] laaxus#0000
you should come back and update this base once it's financially interesting to do so, aka in a long time


[24-Sep-24 03:44 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Pick the low hanging fruit first?


[24-Sep-24 03:46 AM] laaxus#0000
Imagine 
you have a base A, that cost 10 and generate 3 profit a day
you plan to build base B, that cost 10, but generate 5

if you replace base A by B, the actual new profit would be 2 (5-3)
If you build base B as a new base, the new additionnal profit would be 5


[24-Sep-24 03:47 AM] laaxus#0000
let your money printer print until building a new base is much more expansive than rebuilding an existing one


[24-Sep-24 03:48 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Gotcha, thank you. I'll leave it alone so!


[24-Sep-24 06:36 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
...idk RIGs on Harmonia *cost* money to run, the water output is bad and you're better off buying from the CX... I think you could demo them to salvage materials


[24-Sep-24 06:37 AM] laaxus#0000
35k for a no shipping base isn't that bad


[24-Sep-24 06:37 AM] laaxus#0000
Ofc he could have higher profit if he buys from CX


[24-Sep-24 06:37 AM] laaxus#0000
But then he would put more fp on harmonia


[24-Sep-24 06:38 AM] laaxus#0000
Might as well just start a New base


[24-Sep-24 06:41 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If the operating cost of the RIGs (consumables plus degradation) is more than the value of the H2O produced, then there's no reason to stall demolishing them


[24-Sep-24 06:43 AM] laaxus#0000
True but is this the case ?


[24-Sep-24 07:19 AM] jvaler#0000
FRM water imports+consumable imports are way smaller than any of their exports, having RIGs doesn't reduce your logistics strain because you'd be making the ANT -> harmonia trips anyways in order to export


[24-Sep-24 07:19 AM] tanda#0000

If you're using FRMs... Well you're a low volume operation. You don't need that much anyways. But should up up-tier production volumes, then considerations need to be made.

i guess when you make all the ships it's easy to do that


[24-Sep-24 08:44 AM] realharvey#0000
Importing from Boucher is always more efficient in the long term. When you are at the point where a Permit has the cost of 2-3 or even More ships


[24-Sep-24 08:44 AM] realharvey#0000
you need to minmax your production. And just throwing more ships suddenly gets more cost efficient


[24-Sep-24 08:44 AM] realharvey#0000
once you hit that point ROI calculations are getting absurd anyway


[24-Sep-24 08:45 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
KAWA had someone running so many HYF that they were shipping from Boucher into BEN, lol


[24-Sep-24 08:45 AM] realharvey#0000
going for Boucher is the most Permit efficient way. Not logistic efficient way

They'd already filled Etherwind and Poseidon with RIGs and it was just the next best option


[24-Sep-24 09:22 AM] evov#0000
A long time ago I started 2 planets in the boucher system to put HYF's on one and FP's on another. It produced soooo much Coffee for me. I had to abandon them because I needed the permits for something else, but was glad to see they were reasonably well populated by the time I left. Having COF/DW/RAT leave the system used a lot less shipping than sending H2O out.

If anyone is producing H2O anywhere and wants to sell it on planet shout out. I can dedicate some shipping to things if needed.

Hm, weren't there a bunch of orders between 40 and 90? It seems like in the course of 20k units of water the price went up to 90

probably take me around 9 days to get my stock up to 4K OVE  and around 5 days to get my PWO stock up to 2K.
This will change within that time also as I also have to stock my bases with OVE & PWO. Would it be better for me to create those spare amounts and then message you ?


[25-Sep-24 10:38 AM] igfloz#0000
FYI - current stock at ANT 2K OVE & 1.2K PWO


[25-Sep-24 10:53 AM] igfloz#0000
I guess I should take them off the internal list if you're going to wipe it out, lol


[25-Sep-24 10:59 AM] razenpok#0000
I can chip in and provide 2-2.5k OVE so you are not completely wiped out on that

So, you'd stagger the delivery of the supplies to maintain ship captain sanity.   .   .   .  but not stagger repair times.

just... could you share less anti-sjw type memes in the future? i'd like that to not be on this server


[26-Sep-24 02:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ohh yea, def. It was the worst that I've ever seen. So you won't see anything else that'll come close to it, for like another 10 years?

But I like it for the effort of parody... The topic in regards, I could care less for.


[26-Sep-24 03:04 PM] kynadre#0000
It's a shame when insanely good meme-making efforts are wasted on essentially being an a-hole to other people


[26-Sep-24 03:04 PM] kynadre#0000
there's so many better applications of humor

if anything it only makes the bad thing or their play into it worse because they put -that much effort- into it


[26-Sep-24 05:31 PM] jvaler#0000
pretty sure the voice was done with ai anyways so i wouldn't really call it effort

A-holeness is just another facet of the human condition. And it's use historically, in combination with humor was once well known, but people tend to have disdain against those things, if not be outright offended, just like in the days of old. Cicero's "Phillipics" is perhaps the best well-know corollary from like 2000 years ago. Here's a short excerpt of it, via Rome's HBO series (which the writers who made that show took the pains to include it):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kQhG_uVu6U

If I was Mark Antony, or his fan, I'd be seething in a furious rage, after reading that long list of prose, that was circulated. If not, then I'd be rofl'ing.

HBO's "ROME" - Mark Antony is Rome's 'Helen of Troy'
In Cicero's absence, a rather damning speech of his is read to Consul Antony in the Senate.

@tanda are you still producing GC ? I put a juicy bid order on the cx


[06-Oct-24 02:09 AM] tanda#0000
I'd tapered it off, but I can start back up again


[06-Oct-24 02:09 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't know how many a day you can produce


[06-Oct-24 02:10 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm consuming around 70/u a day, but I put a 1k bid order


[06-Oct-24 02:12 AM] tanda#0000
you're making that much EXO right now?


[06-Oct-24 02:12 AM] laaxus#0000
GC is for hms


[06-Oct-24 02:13 AM] laaxus#0000
but yeah, I'm producing that atm


[06-Oct-24 02:13 AM] laaxus#0000
I have LC and HSS stock to sell before producing them again


[06-Oct-24 02:13 AM] laaxus#0000
HMS do sell


[06-Oct-24 02:14 AM] tanda#0000
you probably just sold some to me today, lol


[06-Oct-24 02:15 AM] tanda#0000
I can comfortably supply about 88 per day


[06-Oct-24 02:15 AM] tanda#0000
will need time to ramp it back up as people finished buying out my supply today


[06-Oct-24 06:11 AM] finestone#0000

[06-Oct-24 11:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
do you make your own PG?

Yup

okay, that makes me feel better üòÑ


[06-Oct-24 11:40 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well if I bought PG at its current price


[06-Oct-24 11:40 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It would cost me like 2500/u to make BDE


[06-Oct-24 11:43 AM] sidepipe#0000
honestly, I should probably join all the cool kids on Nike Jr and make my Bfabs there, but I'm not sure if I have the appetite for more construction

I burn 460 odd a day so yeah


[06-Oct-24 02:23 PM] igfloz#0000

ah I see


[08-Oct-24 04:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
well let's hope we have many new bros fixing that soon ish


[08-Oct-24 04:12 PM] marat_sh#0000
actually, looking at the prices on other CXs


[08-Oct-24 04:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
there is simply just not enough AL

[08-Oct-24 04:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
what's the bottle neck? ALO?


[08-Oct-24 04:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah and permits


[08-Oct-24 04:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh and this is weekly btw


[08-Oct-24 04:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
well let's see of new people get their 5 experts and that would fix things


[08-Oct-24 04:17 PM] pxlfox.#0000
My AL is currently not hitting the CX at all - selling it of grid via contracts


[08-Oct-24 04:18 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Not that it would make a big difference


[08-Oct-24 04:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
contracts or cx The demand will still be affected


[08-Oct-24 04:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
if someone bought it through contract it's the same demand if they would buy it of CX


[08-Oct-24 04:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah my AL is all used by me in other ways


[08-Oct-24 04:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but if i didn't make it I would have to buy it


[08-Oct-24 04:21 PM] igfloz#0000
well, yeah. It's still a cost to make, but it's also a $ - or time cost to buy / transport it


[08-Oct-24 04:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh yeah my point is either way I still need AL


[08-Oct-24 04:22 PM] igfloz#0000
If I wsa dedicated AL production, I'd probably post on the CX, but my ALO provisions feed into others. I'm just smelting my leftovers

You can buy it from CX, it's 110 AIC/u nowadays


[08-Oct-24 05:46 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure


[08-Oct-24 07:07 PM] getonthetrain#0000
110 is a bargain for SEA - the mats alone are 100/u based on CX prices not including workers consumables

[08-Oct-24 11:36 PM] evov#0000
It's almost as though, someone harshly raising the price every now and then to give more people the " encouragement " needed to start producing something is a net benefit to everyone wouldn't you say?


[08-Oct-24 11:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
that is very true


[08-Oct-24 11:53 PM] evov#0000
There is plenty of AL. I go swimming in piles of it on a regular basis üôÇ


[08-Oct-24 11:54 PM] evov#0000
Across the CX's, I think I've still got around 40k in storage. I'll keep feeding it slowly into the system whenever the price gets too high.


[09-Oct-24 12:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well I dont have 40k in storage üòõ


[09-Oct-24 12:22 AM] evov#0000

however, you must know this data comes from a community tool

^ not entirely true.


[16-Oct-24 05:16 PM] evov#0000
There's lots of different reasons why someone might want to buy out a market. Sometimes immediate profit is just a side benefit.


[16-Oct-24 05:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
he didn't put in buy orders so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[16-Oct-24 05:17 PM] evov#0000
Or buy out the C in other regions.


[16-Oct-24 05:18 PM] evov#0000
Which . . is what I would have done if I wanted to actually impact the price.


[16-Oct-24 05:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe he just really wanted to have some expensive C on the market for a long time üòõ


[16-Oct-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Right, i meant more your price impact on ANT only lasted a few days


[16-Oct-24 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Then it reset


[16-Oct-24 06:02 PM] jcheung#0000
That person buying C was purely to mess with things for shiggles


[16-Oct-24 06:08 PM] evov#0000
Yea, the price in ANT reset after a few days. The price everywhere else took a lot longer to fall.

Which means that all the non-ANT-based PrunPlanner addicts had a skewed perspective for a while. 100-200 price difference in AL can have out-sized impacts on the profitability of things down the line.


[16-Oct-24 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000

time will tell how well that worked out üòÑ


[19-Oct-24 03:41 PM] tanda#0000
my interest in electronics is tempered by the field of electronics


[19-Oct-24 03:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah. high upfront costs with lots of vertical integration complexity, plus slow markets so it's hard to tell if your investment will be worth it


[19-Oct-24 03:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm just finally at a point where I can take that risk and see how it goes


[19-Oct-24 05:03 PM] evov#0000
I also find due to the low shipping requirements for that Manufacturing <-> Electronics - I often end up more stock than I'd like building up at the bases.

[02-Nov-24 07:15 AM] jcheung#0000
cost of a red close by matching cocg is worth it over a farther away triple green


[02-Nov-24 07:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm not gatekeeping, I just think he's doing an economic mistake
So I just want him to be extra sure of his choice :p


[02-Nov-24 07:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
well, I don't need to


[02-Nov-24 07:15 AM] laaxus#0000
I agree on that, was not my point


[02-Nov-24 07:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but I want to settle on this particular planet


[02-Nov-24 07:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and it sadly needs those materials


[02-Nov-24 07:16 AM] laaxus#0000
SEA is not that expensive, someone used to sell it in #internal-offers but he stopped


[02-Nov-24 07:16 AM] laaxus#0000
as for TSH ... there's a shortage because of the incomming gateways


[02-Nov-24 07:16 AM] laaxus#0000
the production just isn't there


[02-Nov-24 07:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000

[02-Nov-24 07:17 AM] laaxus#0000
My advice is to avoid TSH planets


[02-Nov-24 07:19 AM] laaxus#0000
50% higher base cost mean 50% higher ROI

[02-Nov-24 07:22 AM] jcheung#0000
...tsh is unlikely to add 50%

other way I think? PE to INS works out positively based on universal average cost for both, idk how it compares to just ANT prices though


[07-Nov-24 09:51 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's like a 17.5:1 ratio of PE to INS


[07-Nov-24 09:53 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

I'm getting scared for BEN, hardly enough INS on CX to build a single base...

I saw that. competition has been getting fiercer in ANT, so I think the next stage is me shipping to BEN/HRT


[07-Nov-24 10:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think it's also cause BEN supplies a lot of the universes H. The big shortage of H recently sparked a lot of building the cold planet where it's collected.

yeah... genuinely impressive that Antares build up as successfully as it did. In early universe seems like HRT and BEN were really strong, but as the universe grew the late game focus on MOR and ANT metals shifted markets to those regions. BEN is amazing for Ag, food, and chem though

Usually I just do my weekly re-supply runs through CX bid orders. Thought it might make sense to put up my weekly consume/repair "shopping list" here incase there's any bulk producers looking for a buyer.  Hit me up if you're looking to sell any of the following -

Doesn't allow me to edit in a new image of current outstanding buy orders.
Any idea's on the best way to update a list on here to show as components get completed?


[08-Nov-24 12:02 PM] .shiva.#0000
I have a weeks worth of LTA, and 2 of LBH I'd sell, been lazy about offloading

Per the edit, I don't think there's a great way.
Maybe just a text list + strike through? Ex
- Foo 100 @ 1500
- ~~ Bar 250 @ 3000 ~~
- Baz 100 @ 500


[09-Nov-24 04:41 PM] evov#0000
If I have to manually type it out all the time, instead of cut/paste or screen shotting - I'll just stick to the CX.

I sold out a lot last night. I only have about 60-70 units left at ANT. I can probably supply 200 units by saturday or so.

That‚Äôs not that uncommon in PrUn. The community is relatively small and divided into the 4 main markets. Therefore, many materials are undersupplied or have just a few supplier. It happens from time to time, that a whale just buys his half-year supplies for his 20 bases and spikes up prices‚Ä¶ or some troll trying to manipulate the market and stranding with his carbon on ANT‚Ä¶

It's the same as a regular 2k/2k ship just without the FTL tanks and emitters, which are half the price of any new ship alone.


[09-Dec-24 10:17 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Obviously the tradeoff being that they can't go interstellar, though I wager there will be a lot more being made soon once the gates are built.

Can confirm - all the flx I put up on the CX was bought out by bumblr industries.

I've still got 5000 FLX in reserve if anyone gets desperate for it. But I suspect that people's production will have spooled up by now to start fixing things naturally.


[16-Dec-24 07:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
The drop in price after all this will be massive, so if anyone is spinning up some CHPs, make sure you have other plans for then to pivot to...

ü§î if there's nothing outbound, then it could be elon>hal>electro>ant, no?


[03-Jan-25 07:32 AM] jcheung#0000
well. i guess you lose a bunch of hours stoping at elon


[03-Jan-25 08:03 AM] tanda#0000
Elon is in the whole other direction, too. Quicker to send the extra ship


[03-Jan-25 08:59 AM] jcheung#0000
Oh. Did i misremember where elon was?


[03-Jan-25 08:59 AM] jcheung#0000

[03-Jan-25 03:42 PM] jvaler#0000
okay... hm


[03-Jan-25 03:42 PM] jvaler#0000
if you rent 6 WAR would it be possible for you to juggle the 2 shipments?


[03-Jan-25 03:43 PM] jvaler#0000
cause you won't be able to unload the O until the BGO is picked up


[03-Jan-25 03:44 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm not sure if cont mechanics allow for shipment pickup to go straight to WAR though


[03-Jan-25 03:54 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Didn‚Äôt I pick up the BGO?


[03-Jan-25 03:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I have a base there so space should be ample

[03-Jan-25 07:27 PM] jvaler#0000
it's too far?


[03-Jan-25 07:28 PM] jvaler#0000
cause the triple green is nice vs SE-110d


[03-Jan-25 07:28 PM] tanda#0000
I'm in wind-down mode for Harmonia right now


[03-Jan-25 07:28 PM] jvaler#0000
well harmonia doesn't have to feed nascent... i'm transitioning into it being fed by SE-110b myself

been considering something similar


[07-Jan-25 03:03 PM] jcheung#0000
if you have more CL to send i can still carry it ü§∑


[07-Jan-25 03:03 PM] jcheung#0000
also any backhaul?


[07-Jan-25 03:04 PM] laaxus#0000
none, it's exceptionnal
I have a shipping route Halcyon -> Electronica -> 840c


[07-Jan-25 03:04 PM] laaxus#0000
So I produce all the CL I need


[07-Jan-25 03:05 PM] laaxus#0000
I really want to rename 840c, I was planning on naming it enki, but then someone said that a mesopotamian name was not a great fit for Antares, which seek greek name


[07-Jan-25 03:15 PM] jvaler#0000
wait ohmygod when i recommended "halcyon" as a name to hal98 i didn't even realize it was greek
really lucky there i guess

I would rather have 4 bases that turn HAL into EPO than 2 CL and 2 EPO

13.5 for ADI. Someone else might have it cheaper but I don't make it, I'm just shipping in that cheap stuff from BEN ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[08-Jan-25 12:31 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm on basic so I barely do any of my own shipping. But DarkFuel usually does 30k for an LCB (33,333 SF)


[08-Jan-25 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000

[09-Jan-25 11:35 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
The BEST group (like early stage ADI for Benten) actually started as a small group we called the Benten Barons, lol. Our goal was to MM SF and it's inputs at BEN. It worked, but my job in it was buyin up millions of SF to ship to other CX to make sure it stayed profitable at BEN. So I've got... a lot üòÖ

[19-Jan-25 10:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
Incase you are curious, its on its way now :D


[20-Jan-25 06:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
@spermatozoon_saloon if you need anything to go from NOR to ANT, nows the time to post a shipping order, fully empty ship going there to pick stuff up.


[20-Jan-25 12:25 PM] iggydotexe#0000
if i have a partially filled order does it make sense to re-post a new one at higher purchasing price or just wait until it's filled by someone?

[20-Jan-25 12:26 PM] iggydotexe#0000
ooo i could use 11


[20-Jan-25 12:27 PM] iggydotexe#0000
this is my first time sending a cont ill figure it out


[20-Jan-25 12:27 PM] igfloz#0000
well... I could just fill your buy order - but hey, lets see if we can save you some coin also üòõ


[20-Jan-25 12:27 PM] iggydotexe#0000
whats the process for sending a contract?


[20-Jan-25 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Open a buffer with CONTD


[20-Jan-25 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
To make a Contract draft


[20-Jan-25 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Then create a draft of a CONT and then choose a Buy draft


[20-Jan-25 12:28 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And then fill it out


[20-Jan-25 12:30 PM] igfloz#0000
hmmmm. I don't see a buy order for MHL on the CX for 4820 ?? - already removed ??


[20-Jan-25 12:30 PM] iggydotexe#0000

lol,  you send it to me


[20-Jan-25 12:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000

ANT is fine üôÇ


[20-Jan-25 12:31 PM] igfloz#0000
...and before you send, how many do you REALLY need  ?? (expanding ?)


[20-Jan-25 12:31 PM] iggydotexe#0000
oh my mistake wrong tag


[20-Jan-25 12:31 PM] iggydotexe#0000
11 should be good for now I wanna set something up with some buffer cash


[20-Jan-25 12:33 PM] igfloz#0000
hmm, looks like you're full


[20-Jan-25 12:34 PM] iggydotexe#0000
i have a ship with 200/200 available


[20-Jan-25 12:34 PM] igfloz#0000
might need some wharehouse space


[20-Jan-25 12:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yup


[20-Jan-25 12:34 PM] iggydotexe#0000
oh it doesnt go straight to the ship?


[20-Jan-25 12:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Since it‚Äôs a buy contract you‚Äôll need a warehouse


[20-Jan-25 12:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If Igfloz would‚Äôve made a sell contract for you his warehouse would‚Äôve been the buffer to send it right to the ship for you


[20-Jan-25 12:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But having 1 or 2 war houses at ANT is a good thing


[20-Jan-25 12:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
They‚Äôre cheap


[20-Jan-25 12:35 PM] iggydotexe#0000
ok how do i purchase one?


[20-Jan-25 12:36 PM] igfloz#0000
there will come a day when you have 20 -50 wharehouse  at ANT üòõ

If it's showing it in stock, feel free to send it!

ok thank you, and for clarification, what does the buffer section indicate?


[22-Jan-25 07:28 PM] tanda#0000
Just how much I'd prefer to keep on hand (mostly useful for stuff like RAT)


[22-Jan-25 07:29 PM] freeloader4#0000
so if I was going to request those 25 BSE is that a no go?


[22-Jan-25 07:33 PM] tanda#0000
Yes, unfortunately. I have been doing (and still have to do more) base repairs

you only want the CM?

i suggest taking the discounts here as much as you can '_'


[26-Jan-25 01:16 AM] jcheung#0000
you can work on paying it forward in the future

BDE x10 @ ~2000/u
BTA x2 @ ~ 1200/u
MCG x620 @ ~32/u


[26-Jan-25 04:42 AM] pagy1234#0000

reducing the interest to account for 5d term size gets this (i think...)

In template, there's a barely visible button that says add commodity


[04-Feb-25 04:56 PM] jcheung#0000
Just make sure you set the location before doing that if you plan on having 5 or more, because it will force that field out of view

my 10k bid on the CX is at 300/u, it'd be fair to match that

Tanda, I sent you an internal order for PSL, but I dont have the cash to pay for all of it at once, so I split it up into 2 seperate conditions,  
Will pay them seperately when I have money. Thanks


[06-Feb-25 03:50 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Careful, that's dangerous material.  It can kill you if you come in contact with too much of it.


[06-Feb-25 05:46 AM] tanda#0000
Hey there! You sent a contract to buy HSE, is that correct? I don't even make PSL


[06-Feb-25 06:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh mb mb, I sent the PSL one to someone else


[06-Feb-25 06:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
I meant HSE for you


[06-Feb-25 06:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
Thats where the contract is split into 2 conditions right?


[06-Feb-25 06:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah HSE is the insanely expensive one


[06-Feb-25 06:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
PSL cont went to jcheung iirc, that one i can afford


[06-Feb-25 06:24 AM] tanda#0000
hey no worries if you need longer to pay on it. Feel free to send 7-10 day contracts instead of 3 days too


[06-Feb-25 06:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
Nah nah il have the cash pretty soon, sell orders just need to go through then i can pay

you can just scroll down of the buildings list - if you repair, the building will jump to the top of the list, so you always have the most broken one under your mouse

@potaterror it's going to take around 10 days for me to fill that-someone else just cleaned me out


[10-Feb-25 07:30 PM] potaterror#0000
No worries. I batch out my supplies in weekly orders and I'm still in the stockpiling phase. That one is only as big as it was because I realized I'd flubbed somewhere, but I've got enough for a few weeks before any base runs out.


[10-Feb-25 07:31 PM] potaterror#0000
Just means you'll probably get another contract from me for a lesser amount before you fill that one.


[10-Feb-25 07:31 PM] potaterror#0000
No urgency to any of 'em.

I'm about to (30m from now) land just over 15k at ANT, but I'm still operating in batches smaller than what I thought the internal [kevin] market wanted (40k+ ?), so I just drop it on the CX to keep my cash flow high.

I'm happy to sell internally though.


[12-Feb-25 08:13 AM] tanda#0000
Any time I see the CX below the internal Kevin price i generally buy that back above that price point

[13-Feb-25 03:44 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
@tanda can I get:

24 BBH
74 BSE
12 HSE
1440 INS

at ANT?

(I'm not clear if your storefront has this available or not at least partly because of the buffer and partly because stock isn't there, and the listed price for INS on the sheet isn't the same as in your #internal-offers post, so I wasn't sure what contract to send üôÇ

Thanks!


[13-Feb-25 06:03 AM] tanda#0000
Stock levels are accurate when I just checked. Sorry about the price confusion on the INS, the 100/unit is correct. I'm below my buffer on everything except the HSE, but I could fulfill the BBH, 5 HSE and the INS


[13-Feb-25 06:06 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'll take whatever you can fill.  Should I just send you a contract then?


[13-Feb-25 06:07 AM] tanda#0000
Yes please!


[13-Feb-25 06:15 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Anyone else able to cover the remainder (even partly)?

[edit: filled!]
~~74 BSE~~
~~7 HSE~~

@akyantor or @.urpalhal maybe?

(BSE looks low supply on the internal storefronts üôÇ


[13-Feb-25 06:16 AM] akyantor#0000
You can send a contract for HSE, but BSE, I'm tapped out


[13-Feb-25 06:16 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000

it also counts repair costs for the base

where do you produce all that?, my farms on harmonia have combined output of abobut 141 units per day, dont know where else to go really


[25-Feb-25 09:21 PM] pagy1234#0000
been considering phobos but CoCG is bad


[25-Feb-25 09:22 PM] pagy1234#0000
full base there will only get 98 units


[25-Feb-25 09:23 PM] tanda#0000
Its from a HYF base in Thalassa


[25-Feb-25 09:24 PM] pagy1234#0000
does HYF really produce that much more?


[25-Feb-25 09:24 PM] tanda#0000
You can grow a lot of basic crops without fertility. Oh heck yeah

agri?


[25-Feb-25 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
Agricultural just like FRMs


[25-Feb-25 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
Good spots are Thalassa B and Life


[25-Feb-25 09:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
ohh, but it makes completely different stuf


[25-Feb-25 09:25 PM] pagy1234#0000
will have to change RAT recipie again


[25-Feb-25 09:26 PM] tanda#0000
Or you could split it between them. Have your FRM base make GRN, and grow the other two mats on the HYF base


[25-Feb-25 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
I love Thalassa because the system is tiny (under 1 AU across) and all the planets you really need are there


[25-Feb-25 09:27 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah thats what im considering, ALG and VEG on HYF then GRN on FRM


[25-Feb-25 09:28 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh neat, il check it out


[25-Feb-25 09:28 PM] pagy1234#0000
do you produce the NC there aswell?

biggest issue with HYFs for now is that the NS market is kinda shot atm


[25-Feb-25 09:28 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, it's not great, but that base is really simple too


[25-Feb-25 09:29 PM] tanda#0000
And produces a lot more than you need


[25-Feb-25 09:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I forget which planet, but there's a chemistry COGC planet with N on it which makes for a convenient NS base

I already sold a good chunk of my on hand off to sidepipe last evening. I could do probably as high as 500 each of those two products right now.
 My preference is flat rate, though, so 220/unit for both


[26-Feb-25 06:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
ah ok, well its alright then, I need the ALG and VEG to last me a while so I dont think 500 will work well for me.

[28-Feb-25 12:38 AM] evov#0000
As far as I know, I'm the only one who builds/sells ships solo. Most people do it as part of a group/collective etc. But I could be wrong.

Markets today are a lot more mature than they were when I started to build ships. Today, you could probably lean on the markets a lot more instead of building virtually every component yourself. When I started, basically everything above smelting / material extraction I had to make myself in order to ensure supply.


[28-Feb-25 06:57 AM] tanda#0000
hey @pagy1234, could you resend your contract for delivery at ANT? You're requesting Phobos and I don't have a ship free to move that

To a degree i can also pay in advance, but not for too much material. Also preference of batches of 250+ but the first couple can be lower while you get rolling

you willing to do 850/week so i have a little wiggle room on my supplies?


[03-Mar-25 02:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah. But i highly recommend taking at least some of that as backhaul to CX with you as i can't easily handle quite that much AL


[03-Mar-25 02:29 PM] inspirity#0000
yeah good point


[03-Mar-25 02:30 PM] inspirity#0000
how much are u willing to settle for?


[03-Mar-25 02:33 PM] jcheung#0000
Longer term... i can probably swing 750/u


[03-Mar-25 02:34 PM] inspirity#0000
ooh i meant in how many units u want a week xD


[03-Mar-25 02:36 PM] jcheung#0000
600/wk to start probably, will have to adjust down in a few weeks


[03-Mar-25 02:36 PM] inspirity#0000
alr


[03-Mar-25 02:39 PM] jcheung#0000
I also want to state again that if you get it to the cx you can probably easily hit 800 if you can wait a day or three


[03-Mar-25 02:39 PM] jcheung#0000
At least under current market conditions


[03-Mar-25 02:40 PM] igfloz#0000
@inspirity something I've found (and it's different for every deal that's done between players) - when your production increases due to experts, you may find that err, 50 - 60% is already in the agreed deal. You will end up taking maybe 20 - 30% back to CX for sale, but you will inevitably have some spare product. Look to where that spare product can be used (new planets, new recipes, etc.)


[03-Mar-25 02:41 PM] inspirity#0000
i like your funny words magic man


[03-Mar-25 02:41 PM] inspirity#0000
i kinda get what you're saying


[03-Mar-25 02:42 PM] inspirity#0000
its like, when ur production number get bigger, less % in deal, more go to cx but also extra product


[03-Mar-25 02:42 PM] igfloz#0000
yeah, I suppose

Hi, as my finance are becoming tight from producing and selling tens of millions worth of fabs, I'm trying to sell the following at discount price :
- ~~ 753 GC at 350/U~~
- ~~ 5250 NR at 350/U~~
- 30031 NCS at 38/U
- ~~ 314 IND at 3500/U~~
-  ~~11126 SWF at 170/U~~

If no one wants, I'll just sell into the CX bids, but I'd rather sell at a discount to a fellow ADI member


[05-Mar-25 04:06 PM] evov#0000
You can cont me the SWF and NR if you like.

[09-Mar-25 01:22 AM] evany.#0000
offers/requests are typicall for recurring, i.e your situation  but its kind of treated more like an advertisement board. not typically conversation

yeah it is just to get started but I ll try to secure a sustainable source in the next few days


[09-Mar-25 01:23 AM] evany.#0000
yours is kind of both but since it's targeted to specific people you'd probably wanna keep that sort of thing out if that makes sense.

enough to fill your house and then some

If you need more in the future just fire off a cont, I'll honor the same price point for any public infrastructure needs. I don't run a huge production surplus, but I can occasionally fill some gaps.

because it's a pain to make it and even at 700 I don't think it's very lucrative but IMO has a stable market ( hopefully it is going to rise a little more)\

I posted an ad in shipping but if you have some idling ships I'm happy to pay for their services :
ANT > Electronica.

there s a shipment of goods ready to go.

If you have more rooms I could add consumables for 20 days as well on top of that:

Hey everyone, just wanted to let you know I've had to increase my RFAB prices internally. I swapped to purchasing LFABs from the CX, and this price increase means I lose money at my old prices. Some prices are still competitive to the market, but the market is kinda...silly right now on RFABs.

FYI - I've updated my internal offer prices, with some reductions for Rfabs/Afabs, but added a condition that they're for folks who've started companies within the last 200 days. *The intention is to focus the discounts on supporting the bootstrapping of the newest players. For longer termed players I'd prefer to trade via the market to provide price transparency.* https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1183249045624471582/1241848462249562193

I've got about 6k MEA sitting at ANT. I was tempted to send it off to cash in on the MOR buying frenzy, but I'll keep it here and keep feeding it into the CX as needed. Prices are what they are, but I'll do what I can to ensure continued supply.

The two baseline priorities I set myself for this .. kinda project Iv'e started working on... 
1. Ensure supply on the ANT CX for critical materials.
2. If the ANT price is the most expensive of the 4 main CX's- put downward pressure on the price.

Is KoM always cheaper at HRT?


[10-Apr-25 05:16 PM] vanarazor#0000
I might set up a big buy over there ay


[10-Apr-25 05:19 PM] .shiva.#0000
it just spiked in AI1 because someone bought 20k and relisted this week

Anybody out there make AEF?


[11-Apr-25 02:18 AM] zillatron#0000
Yes! in small-ish quantities atm which is why its not on my internal listing - how much are you looking for?


[11-Apr-25 02:55 AM] realharvey#0000
AEF isn't really profitable to produce right now so CX prices should be pretty fine


[11-Apr-25 06:59 AM] zillatron#0000
there's only some left over from Paris on the CX, I've been putting up what I make but I can supply some directly if people need


[11-Apr-25 07:34 AM] pagy1234#0000
@akyantor I sent you a cont for some LFABs this morning, pls let me know ASAP if you are able to fulfil them, I want to get my ship out to build my base soon.


[11-Apr-25 07:57 AM] akyantor#0000
I've filled the order


[11-Apr-25 08:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
Thanks :D


[11-Apr-25 10:23 AM] finestone#0000
100-200 what price


[11-Apr-25 10:26 AM] finestone#0000
I show under 20 day ROI for AEF even with high PG prices


[11-Apr-25 10:31 AM] finestone#0000
This is with PG set to 46

and thats AEF at 4000 with only ask currently at 4250


[11-Apr-25 10:34 AM] realharvey#0000
In comparisson to LFabs its the worst option tho. and only at 50k profit per base

[11-Apr-25 10:36 AM] finestone#0000
that does make sense


[11-Apr-25 10:37 AM] jcheung#0000
I might be convinced to drop a base for it


[11-Apr-25 10:37 AM] jcheung#0000
Not a full base, but part


[11-Apr-25 10:37 AM] finestone#0000
seems Lfabs are just overpriced


[11-Apr-25 10:37 AM] jcheung#0000
Or AL is underpriced


[11-Apr-25 10:39 AM] finestone#0000
AL is only slightly overproduced


[11-Apr-25 10:41 AM] finestone#0000
LTA/LDE could easily be pushed down to around 3400/8400 if we assume 21day ROI is optimal


[11-Apr-25 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000

Paris has a lot available on the CX. We don't need a base.... yet


[11-Apr-25 01:23 PM] finestone#0000
ANT has like no NE as i recall thats just something we have to import


[11-Apr-25 01:24 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, there are no sizeable deposits here. Best source is HRT


[11-Apr-25 09:22 PM] vanarazor#0000

[12-Apr-25 12:09 AM] jvaler#0000
how long do you want the repayment period to be?


[12-Apr-25 12:10 AM] weltkriegdrei#0000
How much are you loaning me? I'd like it to be a month.


[12-Apr-25 12:11 AM] weltkriegdrei#0000

[12-Apr-25 12:16 AM] weltkriegdrei#0000
What if I want to do 1 mil for 31 days payment period at 3% weekly?


[12-Apr-25 12:24 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I would suggest you take the loan for at least 8 weeks, the weekly payments will be too high otherwise.

150k each week it looks like

On paper that‚Äôs really doable for me. Especially when I use the loan.


[12-Apr-25 06:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well ask Jvaler again if she‚Äôs ok with it


[12-Apr-25 06:31 PM] tanda#0000
I would definitely say, borrow more than you need so that there's some buffer for the first week or two


[12-Apr-25 06:31 PM] tanda#0000
(before your base has a chance to make profit)


[12-Apr-25 06:32 PM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Are you saying 1 mil isn‚Äôt enough? I see that‚Äôs kinda my question to answer but I‚Äôm not so sure. Thats kinda why I bumped it up to 1 mil from 500.

I can buy some from BEN and ship it over. But I don't have a ship there at the moment so it'll take a few days.

[27-Apr-25 03:02 AM] evov#0000
I just cleared out any "cheap" ones from the other CX's. So feel free to put up whatever you need for a juicy profit.


[27-Apr-25 03:03 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well I think I make less than I thought I did so I won‚Äôt have too many after I sell to apple


[27-Apr-25 03:03 AM] evov#0000
It'll be about 4 days before I bring back stuff from the other CX's.

@loans_13178 I would put the message you have in internal offer on bulletin board

Internal offer is for things you want to sell to people in ADI (usually at a lower price than the CX) I wouldn‚Äôt recommend making an offer till later

Looking for 168 ABH & 105 ASE if anyone's in the market to sell, trying to fill a project vacancy. Also looking to exchange funds for AIC to facilitate it, primarily NCC & CIS, if anyone's looking for those.

LES/ES base in ANT space. I'll handle everything. You just have to build the base (i'll ship the mats, cons, etc)
Then at the end of 60 days I'll ask you to demolish the base and hand over the output + any remaining mats


[01-May-25 12:48 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
We can discuss per week payment

2 million over 2 months is pretty good considering everything


[01-May-25 01:29 PM] loans_13178#0000
well yeah but the current highest bid for it is 370k a week but that would start by Sunday.


[01-May-25 01:30 PM] loans_13178#0000
yes but it gets enough people interested to compete for it.
