[02-Oct-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I've got a mostly empty freighter moving out to BEN in a few days, if anyone wants me to ship something


[02-Oct-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Hours, not days. About 10 hours.


[03-Oct-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I would suggest moving GRN or something else burnable instead of C.


[03-Oct-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	It depends on what I can get my hands on


[03-Oct-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	And also what the demand is for


[03-Oct-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	GRN is lighter then C, so it can be more efficient.


[03-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I suppose it really comes down to what you're optimizing for


[03-Oct-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Either way, I can probably push some folks on Nemesis to start making extra INC materials and ship those if there's a market here.


[03-Oct-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Or C, whichever is better.


[05-Oct-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	is anyone planning a trip from BEN to here within the next week? I would be interested in shipping if you have room


[05-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	If only you could have postd that 3 hours ago.


[05-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I could have absolutely done that for you


[05-Oct-21 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	lol bad timing


[06-Oct-21 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I took that ship :)


[07-Oct-21 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Posted new BDE buy orders with the money I recieved from Krenski


[08-Oct-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JPM**:	Completed infirmary BTAs


[08-Oct-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	!That was fast


[08-Oct-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	More BDE donated.


[08-Oct-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	I'm new to the planet. what popi projects are currently in work/planned


[08-Oct-21 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	SST is completed, just needs to be maintained.


[08-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	INF(for Health for Settlers) is almost complete.


[08-Oct-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	funding maintenance is hard without a government though.


[08-Oct-21 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	I was thinking that. any desire to chip in and get an ADM built to get some taxes rolling to pay for upkeep? it happened with remarkable ease on Nemesis through the donations of players who could chip in 40-50k a pop


[08-Oct-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I know on Etherwind the push back was mostly about which currency to use, all we all IC here?


[09-Oct-21 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	I'm mainly CIS, but that wouldn't stop me from thinking the ADM is a good idea. Currency exchange isn't exactly hard.


[09-Oct-21 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Fiddles, I miss types, I'm CIS as well


[09-Oct-21 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**scvalex**:	I'm CIS as well


[09-Oct-21 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I'm CIS as well


[09-Oct-21 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	CIS would work out better, as we'd be like Montem, without the currency conversion.


[09-Oct-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	For the CX contest, Rather then 300 discords I'm going to work from the Ementior section of the UFO discord. https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP is the discord- type in !join Ementior in the access-request section of the discord, for those wanting to co-ordinate.


[10-Oct-21 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**scvalex**:	+1


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Looks like the warehouse is almost complete, just needs BDE-our weakness.


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I knew I forgot to load up on PG when I left BEN


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Well, I knew I had to load up on *something*, just forgot what it was until just now.


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I hate that feeling


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	on my next ship to Ementior I'm bringing 100 units of SUN.... the cost was pretty high lol for 50 units of C and 100 OVE.


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	but it will run the SUN part of the SST for a month+


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	I can make the next set of SUN for the SST. I home grow all the components so my cost is low


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I'm also finally bringing my SUN.  The horrible part is if you miss the consumption cycle your stuck waiting an entire cycle without fulfillment


[11-Oct-21 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I'd buy OFF off market but EPO seems to have dried up


[12-Oct-21 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I've bought enough BDE to finish the INF when my ship arrives and MCG.


[12-Oct-21 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	in less than two days?


[12-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Does anyone produce GL or TUB, STR when the INF comes online?


[12-Oct-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	I can add some Tub


[13-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	anyone have 2 TRU?


[13-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	made a mistake-didn't bring TRU for the PP2 as well.... need 6 TRU


[13-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Infirmary online.


[13-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	added TUB


[13-Oct-21 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Custom flag from @wyago https://com.prosperousuniverse.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/9/908fc224d70e8adba95b5ca1ac877e8a8f48e4c4_2_345x230.png for Ementior.

[15-Oct-21 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Lol I need 1 BBH before POPI hits to speed up my PP2


[15-Oct-21 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	posted one for you


[15-Oct-21 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	filled


[15-Oct-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	INF is going to be pricy to maintain.


[15-Oct-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	What's the going rate on TUB @Esabab and if anyone else wants to quote a price on STR.


[15-Oct-21 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	Noone really selling much TUB


[15-Oct-21 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	looks like maybe 150?


[16-Oct-21 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	putting up experimental "futures" on the Ementior market.


[17-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**scvalex**:	I'll build a GF and can bring TUB... but that's in two weeks.


[17-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**scvalex**:	(also, this might just be me, but I notice conversations on Discord much faster than in APEX chat)


[17-Oct-21 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	This is why there are not many real markets.  Everyone will just drop a building instead of  buying anything


[17-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	it's a matter of cash flow I think, without a good way of getting good amounts of cash it's hard.


[17-Oct-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I'd buy the TUB off the market, but just supplying the DW and SUN is costly enough- SUN requires 10C/per 20 SUN.


[17-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I'm working on OFF, I'd buy it off market(which I did before) but there is none on the market to buy.


[17-Oct-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I posted a order for 100 TUB(which will do us 10 days), but I'll cost 15k.


[17-Oct-21 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Flying back from BEN with 260 free units of cargo space. I'll be shipping out in about 8 hours if anyone wants in.


[18-Oct-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I've costed the running costs for a SST and a INF(fully running)


[18-Oct-21 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	SST maintenance cost: 15.404 k/week. INF maintenance cost:  25.270k/week.


[19-Oct-21 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	I personally feel like the fairest way to share that burden is via taxes from an ADM. The ADM would also probably help in the Arclight Frontier campaign


[19-Oct-21 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I think so, getting a ADM will allow the governor to buy the goods needed.


[19-Oct-21 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	put up a contract to buy 20 TRU for the warehouse, so thing can get shipped in.


[20-Oct-21 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	If anyone is interested i've got about 60 spare carbon. Got regular shipments coming back from Nemesis from my INCs and can spare a bit


[21-Oct-21 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	price?


[21-Oct-21 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	BDE for warehouse donated, have a contract up for 20 TRU for warehouse.


[21-Oct-21 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	any1 doing BHP locally?


[21-Oct-21 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Ah, apologies, As long as the prices are competitive with BEN I'm alright with it.


[21-Oct-21 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Not the most efficient choice, I know, but I like helping and don't care that much about getting every possible cent I can.


[21-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	We'd need HE, which isn't available on the market.


[21-Oct-21 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	does anyone have any HE here?


[21-Oct-21 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	i can ship you HE, im in MOR right now


[21-Oct-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	can bring a full load of 500


[21-Oct-21 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I've sourced it from Blue Matter, once my ships his Benten area, I'll have enough prefabs to start production.


[21-Oct-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I have a buy on the CX, but if your making Hull plates I'll buy some


[21-Oct-21 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	okay, I'm looking at 2.2k-2.5k/unit  The AL cost is high.


[21-Oct-21 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	If I can buy AL at 450 unit I can reduce the cost to 2k/unit


[21-Oct-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I've been looking at a few pricing solutions for BHP.  2.2k/unit or 600/unit If you provide the AL.


[21-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	If you want to provide the AL, just tell me the units you need and then I'll post a order buying that AL for free, and you post a order buying the BHP at 600/unit.


[21-Oct-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	Anyone need anything shipped to Ementior?  I have a ship arriving at BEN in 4 hours.  Then I'll fly to Nemesis.  Then out to Ementior.  Should have about 200 ton/m3 free


[25-Oct-21 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	anyone interested in C or O? My base on Nemesis can support both, but preferably you need to pick it up from there


[25-Oct-21 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I've been trying to peddle O and C from Nem here for a while now. I think everyone already has their sources


[25-Oct-21 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Could be that my prices are wrong, but I haven't gotten much in the way of responses when I asked


[25-Oct-21 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	i mean im still routing it out to Ben easily, but wanted to just mention it


[26-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sintheras**:	Hey, anyone got some BDE for sale by any chance?


[26-Oct-21 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I'm shipping out for BEN in about 8-10 hours, does anyone need something shipped? I've got 350t of space available


[26-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	Do you have room to ship something back?


[26-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I need a emergency supply of water, apparently when I added my OFF to the SST, I also donated all my water.


[26-Oct-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	need about 60 ish units to get me through until my ship gets back.


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I assume you mean DW? I can just sell you some of what I've got if you want. I will also probably have room on the way back, I'm shipping back mostly light stufff.


[26-Oct-21 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I've got it filled.

[02-Nov-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	How many production buildings in each category do you have.


[02-Nov-21 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Frostwood**:	seems to be a average of 10 buildings/base


[03-Nov-21 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	By math, to maintain our current infrastructure we'll need taxes of 30/building/day to generate 41k worth of revenue.

**Frostwood**:	@Esabab where are you getting your BRM from?


[04-Nov-21 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	EL-768D but it got here by accident


[04-Nov-21 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	BRM accidently slipped on a ship?  Sounds like a prelude to Alien invasion lol.


[04-Nov-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	With more settlers on the way I'm looking for a STR source to top up the INF.


[04-Nov-21 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	Krenski could build them


[04-Nov-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Esabab**:	if people want to give up thier extractors for more profitable buildings I could supply ALO/LST at a small markup.  I just want a simple base here to anchor my logistics


[05-Nov-21 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Nov-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	@Esabab maybe you can have your ALO shipped to Benten, as there are plenty of people running empty ships.


[07-Nov-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	I never thought to advertise, but I run back almost empty every run


[07-Nov-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Esabab**:	I'm willing to sell it cheap enough that people could move it if they wanted to but I don't want to coordinate moving anything lol


[07-Nov-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Frostwood**:	Basically I'll pay you once I sell it, and If I guess the market wrong, i'll eat the cost.


[07-Nov-21 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	If you are willing to put up ALO "futures" I will buy it and place contracts to ship it.

**Fuurin**:	Would anyone have 8 lse and 6 lta to either lend me for 2-3 days or straight up sell to me?


[10-Nov-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	so i can put some stuff up before popr


[10-Nov-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JPM**:	LTA on LM cheaper than Benten


[10-Nov-21 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	shit you are right, i had sell ads filtered out


[10-Nov-21 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fuurin**:	that leaves me needing 8 lse to borrow or buy


[10-Nov-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	For everyone's situational awareness, I have some FF sell orders on the LM, intentionally over Benten LM because I'm not really trying to sell volume. But I am maintaining an emergency fuel dump on planet for anyone that may find themselves in need. Consider these ads as more advertising than anything, reach out to me directly if you need emergency gas and I'll sell it to you at fair market prices from Benten space


[10-Nov-21 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	hmm I'm in dire need of C, I'll pay a premium if that's what it takes-I'm using 10 C/day

**Couch**:	I've got 120 units of C at Ben right now and 56 here. I can sell you 30 now and however much you need in like 2 days when my ship arrives


[11-Nov-21 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sonicus83**:	@Krenski i could ship some from Umbra, but that would be in ~1 week earliest..


[11-Nov-21 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Nov-21 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	I realized the order was for only 1000 when I meant 6000-if you'd like to put up a RAT order for 5000 I'll fill it.


[12-Nov-21 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	Yeah, I noticed that but was willing to accept my goof after the fact. I'll post that correction though

**Daemeus**:	I've got some cargo, what's a fair rate per ton?


[13-Nov-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	I don't really have a great answer for that. Whatever you're willin to pay is fine I just figure it'd be a waste to ship all the way out there with empty cargo space


[13-Nov-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Daemeus**:	posted a couple small ads, thanks


[13-Nov-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Flying EW->BEN in 12hrs is 0.3% damage each time.  Ementior -> BEN is 0.3% each flight...  I'm starting to think when we do build ships that LHP won't be worth the savings anymore


[17-Nov-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

Ementior taxes
Now that a functioning government has been established it’s time to decide what the tax rate should be.  In a rough poll of Ementior buildings there seems to be a average of 10 buildings/player with about 20-28 active bases.  SST maintenance cost: 15.404 k/week.  INF maintenance cost:  25.270k/week.  With 2x SST needed, total taxes to maintain t...

**Frostwood**:	Good day fellow Ementiors!  I'd like to see Ementior become a tech powerhouse in the future, but first I'd like to get some basic infrastructure up and running like a second SST and the COGC completed before thinking about a PAR.


[29-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	My platform consists of three things:


[29-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	-second SST


[29-Nov-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	-fully maintained POPI


[29-Nov-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	-COGC completed and maintained


[29-Nov-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	After examining finances the next step would be:


[29-Nov-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	-completing PAR


[29-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frostwood**:	And if anyone's concerned about taxes, the Ementior government will buy back your taxes in goods that the government needs.

Ementior Governor Thread
Since I was elected governor, I thought I’d try one of these governor threads.  Thanks to all that voted for me, even though I was the only one who ran for governor!  Ementior has so unique problems that require a higher tax rate compared to other planets.  For one PP2s use settlers, so Health is a big concern, and a INF is more expensive to run...

[19-Dec-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Couch**:	You'd think that after making that mistake once I'd stop forgetting to ship out here without some spare fuel for the return trip. Anyone spare like 50 FTL fuel?

Ementior Governor Thread: tax income(89k)
2021-12-19T05:00:00Z (UTC)    Taxes this week was 89k-which I immediately spent on DW, OFF, SUN and SOI for the PAR.  SOI might be a bridge too far, but we’ll see, I’ve given pretty generous delivery times for the SOI.

[28-Dec-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Dec-21 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**corrim**:	seems with COGC i will be needing some ALO to keep SME occupied


[30-Dec-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	but that's maybe like 20/d or sth


[30-Dec-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**corrim**:	if i get my economy straight i could focus on SME only, so that would be around 50ALO/d, but now im still good


[02-Jan-22 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcsecond**:	The two-day travel times to and from the nearest CX take a bit of getting used to.  My first base was close enough to a CX that I could send a ship out first thing in the morning and it would be there by late that same night.


[07-Jan-22 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Speaking purely for myself: 1K in warehouse space + a STO covers my needs just fine... Having said that, I'm not as established as some of the older players. It stands to reason that things might be different for them.


[14-Jul-23 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	@NorseFTX Used to list regular buy orders for LHP on the LM here on Ementior. Haven't seen the listings in a while, but he might still be interested.


[17-Aug-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	do you by chance remember what the price was. i could easily list a couple for you people to just pick them up when you need it


[17-Aug-23 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Yes, but with a caveat. The listing was 12,000 CIS for 12 LHP. Which at first glance doesn't seem worth it, until you take into consideration that he also sometimes sells AL here at (significantly) discounted prices.


[17-Aug-23 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	Yeah i did buy AL sometimes from him, but also produced a lot myself. but C prices spikes significantly in my absence, so 1k is a bit low i guess


[17-Aug-23 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	but then again, i am no playing to turn a huge profit. so let's say you lots just sent me conts whenever you need some at a price you deem reasonable :-D


[17-Aug-23 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nicster**:	i have almost 1k in stock


[17-Aug-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I'd like to add on to that. Upgrading the cargo bays on my starter ships to 2K comes first, but once that's done I intend to pull up the Arclight region by the bootstraps.


[17-Aug-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	In the meantime, if there's anything people would like to see being sold (or bought) here or on the Arc CX, do let me know.


[17-Aug-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Dover**:	(Sorry for the slow response, got wiped out by flu for a week).


[21-Dec-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Ha, I got Covid a week ago, head filled up with mucus which impeded neural activity to the point where I couldn't deal with PU.  Now I have to kick-start all my planets, too...


[21-Dec-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	(Good news is, I appear to have survived)


[22-Dec-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Yeah, I tested but it didn't seem to be COVID. Coughing my lungs up still, but I was out flat with fever for four days.


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Get well soon!


[22-Dec-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Coxatrice**:	Looking for people to produce DW/RAT in Arclight, happy to buy from the CX and supply some of the materials required to produce them


[27-Dec-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	There could be an opportunity, not now but next months. I think about to demolish all my bases and rebuilt all of them in outer space. Arclight seems to be my preferred area. In that case I would establish a complete supply for all consumables and at least T1/T2 stuff from scratch for Arc CX. Need to convince 2-3 partners to take part, but it looks good


[27-Dec-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I'd be onboard. Without having checked with them, I'm guessing the people in my corp as well.


[27-Dec-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Hell yeah, well at the moment I don't have enough self-production capacity to provide for my own production


[27-Dec-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	for RAT/DW for my own production


[27-Dec-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaler**:	i'm trying to sell executively on ARC, all my extra supply is being dumped there.


[27-Dec-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaler**:	exclusively oops


[28-Dec-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	It would be nice to have a Group Chat for Arclight; perhaps one specifically to promote use of the CX and another for other aspects of promoting development in the Region.


[29-Dec-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	There is already a channel on UFO discord for arclight: https://i.imgur.com/b5S9x9i.png

**Coxatrice**:	This may be the case, but there's only a single post there from almost 12 months ago


[30-Dec-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	For those of you who have excess, can I please get someone to post BSE/BBH for sale on the CX - I need some additional stock while I'm making HABs for Gallus


[30-Dec-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I would also accept some private trades if so desired, but prefer posting on the CX for the activity boost there


[31-Dec-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I don't do Discord.  This "game" takes enough (too much?) time as it is; I found it impossible to limit my time on Discord, so I just stopped using it.


[31-Dec-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-24 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	There's a heap on the ArcCX


[03-Jan-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I'll be bringing in slightly cheaper Carbon in a few days as well.


[03-Jan-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I have some extra C at Poseidon, will haul some here in a few days.  Emergency? I could sell 10-20 here now.


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	10-20 would keep me going till more arrives. I don't have any ships in the area.


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Speaking of which, seems I have an unfinished ship build sitting here. Looks like all I had left to get was 1 each of CQM, LCB, MSL and LFL


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Well, then, just finish that Ship & hop over to the CX!  ;)


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	(I presume those are all rare & expensive parts that will take lotsa time and/or money to get/make...)

[04-Jan-24 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I have a spare CQM if you want it *shrug*


[05-Jan-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Sure, let me know the price / send me a CONT


[06-Jan-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I'm putting some stuff for sale at Arc CX, generally priced a little below Ben CX:


[06-Jan-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	HER, NS, GL, RG, BTA, LBH, LDE, LTA, RAT, DW, NA, FF, SF, H, CU, ALO, and PE.


[06-Jan-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Plz don't gobble any of that up just to haul back to Ben CX for sale; the point is to entice more Players to build Bases out here by [slowly] turning Arc into a Real CX.


[07-Jan-24 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kaler**:	Excellent job!


[07-Jan-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Semi-sincere "Sorry!" to anybody whose prices I've undercut...


[07-Jan-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I’m glad to have people post heaps on the CX, thanks!


[07-Jan-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	@Konvolut are you getting your N for NS yourself or from BEN? I have an oversupply from my N planet in Arclight and will be posting more (and more) N on Arc as a result


[08-Jan-24 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	I useta buy N at Ben & haul it out here (CHPs on Ementior), but now REALLY glad to be able to buy it here. Thx!


[08-Jan-24 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Being able to get stuff here (Arc CX) will really simplify my logistics (esp still running with just 2 original Starter Ships).


[08-Jan-24 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I'd love to build a system skiff out here, so having stuff on the CX would be great!


[09-Jan-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Well there's heaps of N on the CX now for all who might want some


[09-Jan-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Yay, N!


[09-Jan-24 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	I will soon be dumping a heap of GAL and H on the CX also. I'm also trickling HE3 onto the CX


[10-Jan-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Left a variety of goodies on the CX too


[10-Jan-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**xensored**:	brought some with me to ARC CX, just make a bid below. I set most prices a little above BEN CX to avoid what happened to Hubur (player bought all stuff to ship it back to MOR CX for selling). No problem to fill all bid from local active players at lower prices than BEN CX


[23-Jan-24 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Konvolut**:	Good pricing plan, thx.


[23-Jan-24 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	@Dover, post for 200 I can cover you


[24-Jan-24 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I can only agree with @xensored . If you see something being sold on the ArcCX by me, but the ask price is holding you back, feel free to get in touch with me. ^^


[24-Jan-24 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Just set the prices at around the BenCX price. The shipping costs aren't worth the trip for most people


[24-Jan-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	What price for that O Coxatrice?


[24-Jan-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Also, I'm not worried if someone comes along and buys a ship or two of stuff from me to ship back. I think someone already did. I think of it as marketing (and it keeps us liquid here, as we don't have a market maker to add liquidity


[24-Jan-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Whatever you think is fair. O is hard to come by here, but not impossible


[24-Jan-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Thanks


[24-Jan-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I'm going to be dropping some luxuries on the market tomorrow.


[24-Jan-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	If anyone needs COF or ALE here though, post an ad before I ship it over there.


[24-Jan-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	How are you making your COF? Locally or importing?


[24-Jan-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	(I don't need any, just interested)


[24-Jan-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Brining this lot over from EW


[24-Jan-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Just the surplus I had sitting at BEN


[24-Jan-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	No worries, I'm probably a few weeks from starting my local COF production


[24-Jan-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	planning on feeding all the COF hungry people locally with local production


[24-Jan-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	Need to get more NS production first though


[24-Jan-24 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	This afternoon I'll also be bringing a COF base online, so between the three of us we'll be swimming in the stuff.


[24-Jan-24 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	My next step is a farm at Poseidon, once I have my new ship build and an HQ upgrade done.


[24-Jan-24 06:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	@Sneavarr, looking forward to you buying all my N/NS soon then :)


[24-Jan-24 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	My in-house NS production is limited. After I'm done burning through my old stock though, you can count me among your customers. :p


[24-Jan-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	if anyone need ssome shipping back to BEN, feel free to put ADs on ARC CX local market from ARC to BEN. Next time, I'll fly regularly every 3d with 10 empty ships from ARC to BEN and would take everything with me for free


[24-Jan-24 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	just post them with 1CIS fee


[24-Jan-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coxatrice**:	It would be helpful if people settled Gallus and built some PP2/PP3's I'm trying to get an ENG population for a PP4 (to make TSH)

**Coxatrice**:	No massive impetus, just letting folks know


[25-Jan-24 04:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jul-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Anyone sitting on some PG here?


[09-Jul-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Could make both for you, but unless you have the mats at the ready, I'd have to fly them in.


[09-Jul-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Got some PG sitting in the warehouse at Arc CX. How much would you need?


[09-Jul-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	And I have my ship at the CX currently. If you want to list your PG I'll buy it. Equally, @xensored feel free to sent me a CONT with whatever you are going spare.


[11-Jul-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	@Dover I have most of the mats for the BR2 + CQM either in storage at Gallus, or at nearby bases. The only item I would have to bring in from afar is an NV2. I don't know how much of a hurry you're in though. Provided that you don't need the parts immediately, we can always discuss prices in private.


[11-Jul-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MADDOG9100**:	Hello, FIOC will be coming with 7 bases in the coming weeks. We FIOC would be interested in paying for the festival to be run to get our bases pop full. We will eventually drop more bases eventually.

**Dover**:	Anyone got some O to sell?


[18-Dec-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	How much do you need?


[18-Dec-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Ideally about 100


[18-Dec-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	But even 30 would keep me going for a bit


[18-Dec-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Posted an ad for both 100 and 30


[18-Dec-24 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I'm also still on the look out for a MSL and a AEN if anyone can help with those.


[18-Dec-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Fulfilled both.


[18-Dec-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	As for the MSL and AEN, I have the infrastructure to make them, but the input materials are proving a challenge.

**WhiteLion256**:	Can someone sell me 2 BSE and 20-30 SIO?


[20-Jan-25 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I don't have any BSE or SIO on-planet, but I do have some sitting in a warehouse at Arclight CX. If you're willing to pick them up, I'll sell them to you at a discount.


[20-Jan-25 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhiteLion256**:	surely, ty. i`m relative new in this game, can we make here privat contracts ?


[20-Jan-25 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	No problem. And yeah, private contracts are an option.


[20-Jan-25 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I've just sent you 2 contracts. One for BSE, one for SIO. Both can be picked up at Arc CX.


[21-Jan-25 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhiteLion256**:	TY


[28-Jan-25 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	There's no RAT at the CX here. Does anyone have any to spare?


[29-Jan-25 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Even though I haven't listed any RAT on Arc CX, I do have some available. If you put up a buy order, I'll do my best to fill it.


[29-Jan-25 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Ah, I'm already back here now. I think I have a buy up already.


[29-Jan-25 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	More is en route, but 1K was all I had on hand.


[29-Jan-25 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	I hope it helps at least a little. Other consumables and some construction mats (things like INS, TRU) are also available, even if they're not always listed.


[29-Jan-25 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	Speaking of TRU, I see you have an ad on the LM. Could sell you that amount on Arc CX, if you'd like.


[29-Jan-25 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	Ah yeah, I might as well fly back to the CX

**Nutnic**:	Can someone pick something up for me from arclight?


[26-Feb-25 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Snaevarr**:	One of my ships will reach Arclight in about 10 hours. If no-one else has picked up your shipment by then, I'll bring it along.
