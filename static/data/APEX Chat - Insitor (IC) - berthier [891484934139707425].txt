**TwistedEyes**:	Selling delicious COF at 290/u on the LM if anyone wants to treat their workers with a nice beverage!


[26-Sep-21 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	i had a pioneer monitoring these coms illegally and now they're all pissed i won't buy them coffee

**Xk37**:	coffee is for closers

[26-Sep-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ined**:	Most impressive, the health has gone up a bit. Perhaps COF is proven to increase health?


[30-Sep-21 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	perhaps proven we need to follow the science


[01-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwistedEyes**:	A governor that thinks COF might be important? Earned my vote -tips hat-


[04-Oct-21 01:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	is anyone bringing over COF to offer on the LM?


[04-Oct-21 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	COF at LM


[04-Oct-21 02:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	oh, crap... totally forgot I don't have any local cash. Could you post an ad for 5 units only? Please include an extra amount to cover your LM fees


[04-Oct-21 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	NCC ?


[04-Oct-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	nah, I'm from Benten and only have like 2-3k in both NCC and ICA


[04-Oct-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	so ICA is good, but need a smaller amount :)


[04-Oct-21 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	ok 5 cof at LM


[04-Oct-21 02:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	got it, thanks a lot

[08-Oct-21 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	there is now a limited amount of bandages and aspirins available on the planet


[08-Oct-21 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ined**:	ladies and gents, I present to you Berthier's first engineer: Bert.


[13-Oct-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	He is so amazing that he is unemployed, please give him a job


[13-Oct-21 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZedZack**:	Hey Bert o/ Nice to employ you, someday...


[14-Oct-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwistedEyes**:	Hi Bert! I'll literally never employ you, but boy do I wish you luck in this economy!


[14-Oct-21 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	dude is weird tbh


[16-Oct-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Allayas**:	Would Bert like a job as an axe-wielding security officer?


[16-Oct-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwistedEyes**:	I WOULD hire Bert IF he was an axe-wielding security officer. I offer as much KOM, COF and DW as he desires


[17-Oct-21 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Bert is not into coffee - gives him the jitters. And kombucha is too hippy for his tastes. Bert's a gin man. Shaken, not stirred.


[17-Oct-21 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Allayas**:	And don't forget the medical kit - how can any security officer work without first aid?


[17-Oct-21 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwistedEyes**:	I think Bert needs to lower his standards a little bit, he can't just waltz into a place and demand GIN and MED's

[17-Oct-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Allayas**:	surely with a PhD in architectural design, Bert could design some plywood fashioned out of dried ramen noodles and chocolate

**VicodinTaco**:	Bert is sending me threatening e-mails


[21-Oct-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwistedEyes**:	I wouldn't call them threatening... just passive aggressive


[21-Oct-21 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	ad for AL up on local market, I have 3 day delivery time to give me time to get the cash together (I'll have it in less than 2 days, but gives me a margin for error (cause every time I don't, I stuff something up)


[22-Oct-21 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	they're not threatening if they end with "best regards"


[22-Oct-21 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	anyone need/want rat/dw/C/O ?


[22-Oct-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Efca**:	pls take my add, it is free


[22-Oct-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Back on Earth we were always suspicious of a free lunch. What's the story -- over base capacity? Black Friday loss leader? ;-)


[22-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	demolishing base and out of capacity


[22-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Efca**:	mostly money laundering :P


[22-Oct-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Efca**:	pls pick it up :)


[22-Oct-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Now I'm getting all kinds of spam in my message box -- space flight discounted pleasure cruises, air dock cleaning services...


[22-Oct-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	air lock? air duct? yes, all of them


[22-Oct-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I just arrived at Berthier. Is this a close-knit community? Mostly home bases, or 2nd/3rd base?


[22-Oct-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	It's mostly a quiet community. Except for Bert the Engineer. He has a one-man picket line going at the Administration Center. Apparently he wants a job and thinks the Government can help.


[22-Oct-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Hi Ray. As newly arrived on Berthier your first job is to hire Bert, our lonely engineer without a job. He smokes half a pack of med kits a day and enjoys an occasional glas of gin


[22-Oct-21 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Otherwise this is where you find the best mix of people from Hortus and Moria


[23-Oct-21 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, now I get the joke... I thought you were talking about a player for a couple of days there...


[23-Oct-21 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	On Avalon we've had three technicians glaring at each other over flat pale ale, muttering about "the system" and griping about the dubious skills of engineers who somehow no longer know where Earth is...no wonder nobody knows how to build their own ships. Avalon doesn't yet have any engineers but  they would be 31.6% happy about being 100% unemployed if there were.


[23-Oct-21 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Bert has a statistically good case to qualify for a prescription of medical HER, as 14.8% happiness is 85.2% depressed.


[23-Oct-21 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Avalon has the same number of settlers but double the pioneers. Our brochures read: "Why settle? Have a caffeinated infusion and smell the sulfurous sunrise before an honest day's labor"


[23-Oct-21 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Ah yes, Avalon. The only self-proclaimed kingdom in the universe. yesplease always shows up to our weekly governor meetings with a silly crown


[23-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	That crown was once worn by Earth royalty, a Randy Savage (aka Macho King, until, according to legend, it was lost to another in a ritual called "The Royal Rumble." Due respect.


[23-Oct-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I wonder if there's merit in dispensing with the "vote" for governorship and Avalon can vie for the crown in a demonstration of physical superiority?


[28-Oct-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Amazon Prime Galactic just dropped off my Metalist Studio...an impulse buy to make SFK and MFK for REP. My two SME won't be able to pace the production of iron and steel to keep the FS fires lit, so if anyone needs some metal turned into a different shape (connectors?), let me know. (I'm going to make the same mistake with a WEL soon...)


[29-Oct-21 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I already have a WEL on planet if anyone wants something made with it


[30-Oct-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I may take you up on that once I start to run out of gas canisters [GC]


[30-Oct-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Anyone need something shipped to or from Promitor, Hortus Station, or Avalon, let me know. My only export at the moment is buckets of bolts, so it will take some time to fill the ship!


[30-Oct-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	let me know in advance so I can bring the input materials in (unless you want to provide them in which case I'll only charge you for the cost of consumables it takes to make.


[30-Oct-21 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I only have a WEL so I can make my own TRU and MHL, neither of which I need very many of


[30-Oct-21 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I probably didn't need to make a WEL of my own to handle demand, but figured since it is the same industries I'm already running on planet, and I will already deal with half the materials anyway, might as well


[01-Nov-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	time for chamber

[01-Nov-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	If you need a hand sourcing local Lfabs, let me know, only reason I favor Bfabs at the moment is there is more demand for them, I make them on planet to save on shipping


[02-Nov-21 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Welcome to Berthier TimurOm :)


[02-Nov-21 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	CoGC is up next yes, I'll be balancing investing in it with ensuring we have a good reserve for our population infra


[02-Nov-21 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Lfabs should be easy, the tricky part is getting hands on electronics at reasonable prices


[02-Nov-21 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, I put the offer out there as I produce them onsite, but have to travel to sell them, if I could get a few to sell on planet it would give me cash reserves to buy enough AL that I can hold off on a shipment long enough to increase my profit margins nicely


[03-Nov-21 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	Mor - Berthier departing in 5h / 450 free space


[03-Nov-21 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	just posted an ad, @Willger. thanks - hopefully it's not too late!


[03-Nov-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	graped ;)


[03-Nov-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Bert is really miserable


[03-Nov-21 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	yeah i'm trying not to be mean to him but i literally can't help it


[03-Nov-21 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	he want's to play Diablo 2 on my PC and that ain't happening


[03-Nov-21 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I know he's an engineer but maybe he's into economics? Get him an economic simulator to keep his mind occupied (a friend says they can suck up your time)


[03-Nov-21 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	(a friend of a friend)

[07-Nov-21 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	need to offload 200 MCG, but can't post ads - if anyone's interested in picking them up at like $1/u - please post an ad


[07-Nov-21 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	thanks :)


[07-Nov-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I make my own MCG...but not here. I put up an ad


[07-Nov-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	My base is full, too! My ship is actually dispensing cargo as my ALO is refined.


[07-Nov-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	(and my other ship is arriving soon with 100 MCG! Let's build a warehouse!)


[07-Nov-21 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	building a STO helps a lot


[07-Nov-21 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	but I'm actually trying to clean shop here... Berthier is just too far away from my main on Prox and I'm shutting down operations here now that N isn't a rarity any longer


[07-Nov-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	tried delivering to your ad, but it failed - you base must be full indeed :)

[08-Nov-21 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	mind if I put up an ad for that MCG instead, since I have space, I can also volunteer some of my storage space since my base is small and doesn't need a lot to keep things it stocked up yet


[08-Nov-21 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bla_Razor**:	already took the other ad, sorry


[09-Nov-21 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	We've had about 15% reduction in collected fees during the past 3 weeks, so it seems we have more people cleaning shop than setting up


[09-Nov-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	hence the rising price in ALO at Moria Station


[09-Nov-21 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	AL getting thin too


[09-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**postlim**:	I don't see much difference on hortus though


[09-Nov-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I think that is cause HRT is closer to ANT which has better ALO than us


[10-Nov-21 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	wtb O ... 20 units .. ad at LM ;)


[10-Nov-21 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

**grimble**:	looking to offload 85 mcg i just don't have pro so I can't post an ad


[11-Nov-21 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Is Berthier named after Napoleon's minion?


[14-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	named after an engineer who had the first 99 lvl class in Diablo 2


[14-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	Have a ship going to arrive at Moria tomorrow that will then be coming here if anyone wants to place some orders, it'll arrive in about 18 hours


[14-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	has about a half fill cargo hold, depending on which of my buy orders get filled before it arrives


[14-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	good question Ray, I actually have no clue. It's named by the devs


[14-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I just clued in that "Bert the Engineer" is the namesake of Berthier (though prolly the other way around). I thought he might be Bert the geologist from The Big Bang Theory (that actor plays him in my mind now)


[17-Nov-21 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	Moria -> Berthier / free space / 6 p. t/m³

[18-Nov-21 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwistedEyes**:	I'd probably be at 0% happiness if I was unemployed and stranded on a planet with no job. Pretty soon we'll see him holding a sign outside the pioneers housing saying "Will work for ALE"


[18-Nov-21 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwistedEyes**:	oh shoot, Bert's an engineer... "Will work for GIN"


[18-Nov-21 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	(The pioneers don't have any GIN...they would use it as a grease cleanser)


[18-Nov-21 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Made me think...if each of our workers have a tipple of choice, what's our poison as CEOs? Single malt scotch, infused with AU flakes and aged in sapient pearwood barrels?


[18-Nov-21 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Aged 30 years, using the Rick and Morty time portal method


[18-Nov-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

Unemployment On The Rise, Population Self-Educates In Lack of Jobs
Reviewing the recent published population reports across starter planets show a worrying theme - unemployment is on the rise as the populations keep growing uncontrollably. Phobos leads with a whopping 30.1% unemployment rate, while Promitor keeps it at a more controlled level of 14.2%. The other planets lie somewhere in between.

Pioneers spott...

[18-Nov-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Bert is actually featured in that article before he moved from Proxion to Berthier. Bad choice!


[20-Nov-21 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Well, here Bert the Engineer stands the chance to think the planet was named after him (as I did...whatever it was named before, after Bert arrived the planet seemed much more...


[20-Nov-21 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, I do have very long term plans that may involve hiring him, but those are probably about half a year away at earliest


[21-Nov-21 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-21 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I tried to use it for a while, buying AL straight from the source, but I could get substantially better prices on the CX and even including shipping, it was cheaper to buy it there and ship it back

[20-Dec-21 01:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	Of a sudden the Starbucks has turned into the Fox & Firkin Pub (and coffee for the designated spaceship drivers). No space dogs allowed, due to space fleas. (Ever get 'em in your hazmat?)

**Willger**:	ok, but a WAR would be nice to have ;)


[06-Jan-22 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, the original plan was to have the CoGC by christmas, it's a bit late for that now... but we will see, not that I mind, I know what I use this planet for and what everyone else uses it for, I doubt I'm going to win that one


[06-Jan-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	agreed, until such a time as Berthier becomes a lot bigger, I don't see aiming for higher tiers as worth it, though I think once FTL ships become a thing, people will be more wiling to settle T0 planets further from CX and might drive a lot of medium size players with a large presence in the HRT region out to us


[06-Jan-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	I lost a bit of interest in the game during the christmas holidays, so I missed my estimates for christmas. I'll have the remaining parts for the CoGC on my next trip. Then it's a WAR


[06-Jan-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	I don't see Berthier having enough population to aim for engineers/scientists without having corps invest and raising taxes, so after WAR I propose to just lower taxes to a bare minimum and stay with pioneers, settlers and a few technicians


[06-Jan-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	I'll probably also adjust taxes based on the votes on CoGC - if we really want to focus on something then that expertise/workforce level should have lower tax imo


[07-Jan-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	Great, the people has spoken!


[07-Jan-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jan-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Willger**:	@ined what are you planning for the upkeep of the COGC, auction or buy at set prices at the LM or buy at the CX or should the directors donate?


[10-Jan-22 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	The upkeep and building costs for the CoGC and the other popi buildings have been produced by me or someone from GTU at under market values. I see it as an opportunity to provide "jobs" to the plot owners in the future, but we probably should wait for the improved government contract feature that the devs are working on


[10-Jan-22 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-22 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-22 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	If I put up ads for shipping from OF-375c (in system) for full cargo holds, would people here accept them, I'd pay 5/t (it's heavy stuff I'm transporting (FE for those that want to know))


[30-Jan-22 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-22 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	I'm not wearing a path from my bases on Prom and Avalon to Berthier, but I've got a ship here weekly. My cargo at the moment is a little more than 100t which is a little higher than usual.


[31-Jan-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	It's time to confess...I smelt badly. I'm mining ALO but I've got my smelters refining CUO and FEO and I'm falling behind. Anyone here smelt good? :-D I got an ad up for 20 AL @400 (above MOR and HRT CX requests)


[31-Jan-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RayKowalchuk**:	(Maybe I discovered a new application for OLF...BO.)


[31-Jan-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	I have 5 EXT to keep 6 SME occupied with producing AL, it works pretty good for me. I can't recommend smelting anything else because it means you need to haul ore, which has very low value in comparison to its weight


[31-Jan-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's more, I have a second planet in this system that I ship stuff from, and while I do most of my own shipping, I'm wondering how likely a shipping order from OF-375c to Berthier would be filled, currently on mimimum fuel it's a 14 hour trip, and I can wait for the stuff to arrive, but won't often have stuff going the other way as part of the trip.


[31-Jan-22 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I run 2 EXT and 2 SME here, though mostly 3 PP1 (why I'm importing FE from next planet over) and 2 PP2 as well as an INC, an WEL and 2 BMP. My goal with this base is primarily a constructor base with a bit of manufacturing. I added the EXT and SME when I couldn't buy AL cheap enough locally


[31-Jan-22 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	at any rate, I've put an ad up for a single shipping contract for now, I'm expanding the other base, so I expect more in the future

**TheEnvoy**:	Whats the going rate for AL on Berthier's LM?


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	I am considering another base and the AL question might be able to help me make the decision


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	depends, I tired buying AL on the LM here and couldn't get better than MOR prices, while HRT is closer with lower prices, so I stopped buying. at the time, it was 405/u. so I set up 2 EXT and 2 SME (bad ratio I know) and now only import occasionally (usually from ANT since it's so cheap there that the shipping cost is worth it)


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Timmah**:	i've been thinking about expanding my base here... all i do is mine/smelt AL and ship it off to my construction base. probably silly to ship metals (it sure was when i later tried it with FE, lol), but i don't claim to be a clever man. anyway, i have my needs covered. only reason i haven't expanded is because i currently don't have pro, so i can't post ads, and no one ever has any buy ads up for AL. what's a fair price 'round these parts? i'd be happy to fill up the rest of my base with AL production and just sell it right here on berth.


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Timmah**:	looking at all the exchanges, ANT is definitely the cheapest. i'd be willing to just sell for that price and save people the shipping cost. does 350/u ICA or NCC sound reasonable?


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, 350 sounds good, I'm even happy to help sell the prefabs back at as well, including a discount if I can get it enough AL cheap here


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I have enough EXT and SME for now, but was planning to expand my production soon, I just need to better supply my consumables at this base first (no point expanding production if I run out of consumables because of it)


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	heck, I'm thinking of offering a deal of 200 per Bfab (not including BDE) if you supply of AL needed to make it. The 200 covers my costs plus consumables

**Timmah**:	i've got to make another run out here soon to resupply my own consumables (and pick up AL of course), so i can probably bring enough fabs with me. if i don't have enough i'll definitely take you up on that offer though


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Timmah**:	what i really need to work out first, though, is how much more AL i'll be making a day, because i'm already hauling off the 40-ish i'm making now for my own stuff. don't want you to get too excited if i only have enough space to add like 10 more per day or something ;)


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Timmah**:	okay, so after some quick tinkering in the base planner, i think i'd be making at least 31 AL/day more than i need if i max out this base. probably more, though, because i don't think i'm actually using as much as i initially thought, since i've reduced my PP2s since last time i did this math. so i think you could count on me to produce 40/day (although that's assuming the COCG program stays on pioneers. bit less if not.)


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Timmah**:	hahaha, okay, i am *really* not using my AL since i for some reason decided to go nuts making LTA and they only take 1. i'm sitting on 728 right now here on berth, so if you wanna throw up some buy orders, i can get you some AL this very day ;)


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Timmah**:	as for my expansion, looks like i have all i need. i'm gonna grab the fabs, swing by the cx for some consumables, and be on my way out here. should be up and running in a little over a day.


[12-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Timmah**:	also, i think i can knock out both of those shipping ads for you when i get here. i just started making my own SF, so i don't mind burning a little running empty around this charming little system :)

[16-Feb-22 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I can send a send a ship to either HRT or MOR, or a system in those systems or on the way to one of them, I have some cargo going each way, but not much, and not enough to justify a whole run out that way, but want to keep my ship busy. does anyone want anything shipped to either destination.


[16-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'll want to leave with a couple of hours if possible


[16-Feb-22 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	@bazdakka how much space do you have for MOR and what is your price?


[16-Feb-22 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	6 ICA/NCC (prefer NCC) per unit, I would have 420 space available


[16-Feb-22 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	2 ads up ;)


[16-Feb-22 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I got, I'll send the ship now


[16-Feb-22 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'll be sending a ship to HRT and then onto Promitor afterwards, got a bit over half a cargo hold if anyone wants something transported


[20-Feb-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paulrik4444**:	Should we build some Pop. Infrastructure to support our techs? About 1/3 of them are mine, so I'm definitely willing to contribute.


[20-Feb-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VicodinTaco**:	numbers should come in better next week now that upkeep is filled but looks like some STR is needed


[20-Feb-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ined**:	They have pretty high unemployment so I keep infrastructure intentionally low. If you plan on employing more of them I can definitely focus more on their needs


[21-Feb-22 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	since tax rates can be set per worker tier now, it might be worth looking at that if more upkeep is to be sent to techs


[21-Feb-22 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and while unemployment might be high, remember, that is as a percentage, 24% of 327 is only 78, wouldn't take many buildings to go through all that


[21-Feb-22 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not that I use them myself, just things I can see that I'm pointing out


[26-Feb-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	who was it that had a FS on planet and was offering to make stuff locally using it here?


[26-Feb-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'd either like to buy some materials off you, or just buy the production time if I can supply the inputs


[27-Feb-22 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	does anyone on this planet have 2 BDE they can sell me within a day? if you need them for your own production, I make more, just not in time to save me extra cost of repairs


[27-Feb-22 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'd like to purchase some SFK and MFK, or the production time to make them as I can supply the materials to make them locally, how much for either option (I'd prefer the cheaper one)


[21-Mar-22 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	Hi @bazdakka i´m tomorrow morning (same time like now) at moria, have nearly free cargo to berthier


[21-Mar-22 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I have about 4 cargoholds full worth of goods going to Berthier, let me know how much space you have


[21-Mar-22 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	about 7 people filled 4 different orders at different price points for LST, the lowest was only 0.01 above the MM


[21-Mar-22 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though they didn't finish that one, the rest though, including 0.1 above MM got filled


[21-Mar-22 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	also, price point?


[21-Mar-22 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Apr-22 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'll be sending one of my ships that way myself soon for one, but due to having one ship full time running between OF-375c and Berthier lately, I haven't had time to run out to MOR recently

[09-Apr-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if I pooled all my separate currencies and managed to sell most of my goods on CXs at listed prices, I could probably get a glass STL ship if I really wanted to, it's not necessary yet though

[09-Apr-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm probably going to have to in Hortus, might also do one here, upgrade it enough to have a larger cargo hold to transport the large amount of FE from my other base, though that would require setting up a shipyard here

[11-Apr-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	If you really want a glass ship, we're selling the parts for the basic version in the MOR area. Currently priced around 540K NCC. Feel free to message me for more information on the ship parts.


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not for a glass ship, it's for SFK, MFK and UTS, I have a planet mining the raw materials in system so I can easily provide them and just want to buy time with the facility


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	yeah, but I noticed you talking about glass ships, so I thought to drop some info on those.


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, that's for a different project


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I am interested in them, but not quite yet


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Can't help with the FS , got mine on Montem, but that's not helping you hehe


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Well, remember us, when you are ready for a glass ship. We're also working on the FTL chain, but for now we're working on providing ourselves first on those


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, not worth going to a planet I don't visit anyway to save a small amount


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	That's true


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough, in corp perks and all


[13-Apr-22 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	yeah, having access to ftl ships capable of carrying more goods at once, will help expand our supply chain faster


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	question for future reference, how practical is getting the ship componets delivered to HRT since that'll probably be my first one (I'd like this to be first, but I'd also need to buy a shipyard)


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	That's also a reason why we are aiming for in corp FTL ships with bigger cargo,so we can deliver the ship parts to wherever customers want them delivered.


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	the parts for a glass ship take 2 trips with the starter ships, so having to travel only once, is better :)


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	nice, I'll keep you in mind for when I want a ship


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Great! thanks.


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I was toying around with blueprints the other night and would like a fuel saving engine, and larger cargo bay, roughly how much would they cost?


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	We'll need to check that. As those ships would also need a bigger Bridge / crew quarters ( which are a lot more expensive to make ).


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough, same bridge for what I'm after, bigger crew quarters


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	yeah, creating a blueprint to check it :)


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and due to larger cargo hold, a lot more hull plates and spacecraft components


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	That LIS is which is making it more expensive.


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	yeah


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	also around 100 k difference in LCB or MCB.


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	makes sense, I haven't spent much time looking at the production chains for ships as too many components to keep track of for stuff I don't have much interaction with otherwise


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Lot's and lot's o Titanium that goes into larger cargo bays


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	off, I hear that is expensive


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	ooff*


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	yeah, an SCB vs LCB is a difference of 200k in production heh


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Myself, I'm aiming for my Glass ship to be the "cheap" version, and go for bigger cargo on the FTL ships


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, I have different needs, namely I have a FE resource tap in system and my PP1s on this planet as the other planet has higher settling requirements


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	ah, then it's usefull to have a bigger cargo indeed.


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	agreed, even if said cost comes with a shipyard in system


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though sadly, the insystem one I want has a high load cargo bay, which I think is the most expensive of the large cargo bays (though I don't think it's much of a difference compared to other large cargo bays)


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	anyway, I can't stay on right now, I have stuff to do for a few hours, this was just a quick drop in to reply, not realizing you were online (normally doesn't happen on this planet)


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	not that much difference no, both different mats use TI , one does use FE , other AL as the other mat


[13-Apr-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-May-22 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though be warned, if I run, I have some selfish motives for doing so, I want a shipyard on the planet, though I doubt there is enough demand to spend tax money for it, so I should run


[30-May-22 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MADDOG9100**:	i would like to put a shipyard there as well :P


[30-May-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if nothing happens with the governor regarding that, want to split the costs of a shipyard? I'm still ages away from being able to afford the shipyard, or the ship, but it would be worth knowing how many people would like a shipyard


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	What's the advantage of having a shipyard here? Do we really need that many STL-only ships?


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	OF.375C is the best FE planet near HRT, making the 2 a good combo metallurgist and constructor base combo, plus, when their orbits are close, they are almost as good as Promitor for how close to the CX they are (makes shipping FE at scale possible)


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, not best, there are a couple of better ones, but they require TSH to settle, or HSE in one case (cheaper than TSH, but still expensive for a basic resource tap) wheres just SEA is viable


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	So you want to pay well over 2 million NCC (or ICA) to build a shipyard just so you can avoid having to include an FTL drive?


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Actually, you're suggesting that you want everyone's taxes to cover that cost.


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	How many people will benefit? How many ships, do you think?


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	You might figure out the additional cost of adding an FTL drive and multiply that by the number of ships that would benefit


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is a reason I said I would be a bad idea as governor


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the fact someone else then said they also wanted a shipyard here is the reason why I suggested to split the cost with him


[31-May-22 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	basically, I'd have to figure out how much different ship combos cost, to see if the saving of a shipyard are worth it, I have 4 ship types, 2 of which are STL ships, that I'm considering

[03-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	@MADDOG9100 I'm after a contruction CoCG myself, but would like a shipyard, I don't think there are enough people that want one here to justify using tax money to do so. but would consider working with someone to build one. A shipyard plus STL ship isn't worth it, but half a shipyard plus STL might be worth it (FTL version of the ship I want is cheap enough that the extra cost of a shipyard is more expensive than the upgrade)


[03-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	of course, I could also get the FTL for now and build the shipyard and STL later on for a more dedicated role


[03-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MADDOG9100**:	I would like one personally but it isn’t a necessityl.


[03-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same, I can always get a large FTL ship


[03-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I talked to someone else, and the cost of the FTL ship I want isn't that much more than the STL version


[03-Jun-22 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I would eventually like a shipyard here, so that when I expand to needing yet another ship, I can have one dedicated for this system

**Xk37**:	Hello fellow Berthier denizens. I would like to urge you all to vote for me as governor of Berthier. Although I may have expressed reluctance to run in the past, I did so mostly because I wasn’t sure if our previous leader, Ined, might be coming back from his extended hiatus. Also, I would urge you all to consider _who_ stepped in and covered most of the CoGC fees for the last few cycles! Indeed, my esteemed running mates in this election have not proven their dedication to the job yet as neither of them have helped in this current CoGC cycle. Please remember that as you enjoy the pioneer productivity boost.


[15-Jun-22 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Furthermore, I believe we are going to be hitting some hard times soon with our pioneer and settler populations. Nobody has been funding the population infrastructure for quite some time. I’ve just donated some resources to both of those to hopefully reverse the downwards worker satisfaction trend and encourage more net population migration to this fine planet. I could have donated more but I’ve learned that it’s more efficient to observe the effects on workforce satisfaction over multiple cycles, otherwise some of those resources may be wasted. If I become governor I pledge to use the tax income to maintain not only the CoGC but also the POPI so that Berthier can reach its full potential in time.

[18-Jun-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Hi @VizoR -- do you mean you are short that many PIO from a recent expansion of yours? Because the population report looks like PIO are reasonably okay. There were no open jobs, but safety is low.


[18-Jun-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Settlers and technicians are unhappy - need to fix that


[18-Jun-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bazdakka**:	you can only take so many from the unemployed worker pool each week, basically, to stop 1 person suddenly emptying the pool over 1 week, when the next pop report happens it will fill your open jobs


[18-Jun-22 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yeah that's likely what happened. I ma reading up on the various programs I can run to boost immigration. If the problem persists I can try one of those, but I suspect it will sort itself out on its own, especially since PIO are above 70% happiness right now


[18-Jun-22 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	probably still a good idea after the low happiness caused by Ined disappearing, just for a couple of weeks to make sure there are no shortages. I read a couple of days ago in global chat that happiness is a 5 week rolling average, so I think we have 2 weeks we got hit hard


[18-Jun-22 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Okay. I'm worried about the tiers above PIO in the short term though.


[18-Jun-22 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Kicked off the Family Support II program for the next 7 days - will help boost growth for pioneers, settlers and technicians for 7 days


[18-Jun-22 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, same, I think programs are meant to be a short term fix for problems, compared to long term building infrastructure (they were too powerful when introduced, but I think they got scaled back a bit)


[20-Jun-22 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, I want constructor, though if the planet ends up as a metallurgy, I can move my construction part to OF-375C in system


[20-Jun-22 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	means this planet will probably only ever have a single permit on it, where's if it ends up constructor, I'll put 2 more permits down when I can spare the shipping for it


[20-Jun-22 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm also aware less people here want construction, so I'm unlikely to get what I want


[20-Jun-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I just voted Metallurgy again - I want to make a case for that coice for CoGC. It would make this place an aluminum power-house!


[20-Jun-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	also helpful for ASM and HWP


[20-Jun-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I realize we have no ASMs here yet... but Bert needs a job


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	i think metallurgy or resource extraction would be a good CoGC bonus.


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	1 SME (with PWO and COF , no experts , no CoGC) - 6,7 AL / Day


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	1 SME (with PWO and COF , only 2 experst AND CoGC)  - 8.91 AL / Day


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	1 SME (with PWO and COF , 5 experts AND CoGC) 10,7 AL / Day


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	1 EXT (with PWO and COF , no experts , no CoGC) 14 ALO / Day


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	1 EXT (with PWO and COF , 2 experts AND CoGC) 18,7 ALO / Day


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	1 EXT (with PWO and COF , 5 experts AND CoGC) 22,47 ALO / Day


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	In both examples, ONLY one building is listed


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	Resource Extraction give bonus for INC (Carbon boost for all players...)


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	construction is also a good idea


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	but in my opinion, it is better to specialize in a particular thing that gives a 25% bonus than to choose the general one that only gives a 10% bonus.


[21-Jun-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	I'm sorry. I forgot to indicate in the examples that SME belongs to Metallurgy, EXT to Resource Extraction (CoGC Program)

***PsycoPhishy** joined.*


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I was messing around with some hypotheticals.  If you max out Berthier with just EXT and SME (and HB1 of course) and compare max efficiency for Metallurgy versus resource extraction you get better results for Metallurgy


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	with metallurgy COGC and 5 experts you can run 10 SME and feed them with 9 EXT for about 130 AL/day


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	with RE COGC and 5 experts you only need to run 6 EXT to feed 13 SME, but the daily AL output drops to 88/day


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	the other bonus with metallurgy is you can use it at higher tiers. not so with resrouce extraction


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	oh wait - I looked at the wrong thing. mettalurgy gets only about 86/day


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	so it's slightly less efficient for metallurgy bonus. 86/day vs 88/day maxed out. You still get the higher tier benefits though


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I would try to do the same with construction but it gets too complicated. lol


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	ouch, I've lost some pioneers, not many, but I'm 90 short of cap (and need slightly over cap total), so yeah, definitely need that short term boost


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mmmd**:	yeah we ran out of pioneers


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	we're running a boost program already. It will continue for a few more days. I can start a pioneer imigration program after that which will add 500 new pioneers


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	we've had several new people join in the last week or two and they are likely building up their bases.


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	the current program I kicked off a few days ago is "Family Support II" -- "Increase the natural growth of Pioneers, Settlers and Technicians by 10% for one week by offering benefits for families."


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've scheduled "Pioneer Immigration" to start next - in about 3 1/2 days


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	This was caused by rapid expansion, particularly for PIO. Each week the pool gets evenly distributed between every base.


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	if there is a shortage eveyone drops until things recover through immigration


[22-Jun-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I also suspect workers will 'prefer' bases that offer luxury consumables over those that don't, but I have no data to back that up. It's just a hunch

[23-Jun-22 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but yeah, I knew your were working on, though I think we might need to run it longer than expected


[23-Jun-22 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	we may also want to upgrade out pop infrastructure to account for new people (not massively, just a single upgrade) since we can run them at below max level

[23-Jun-22 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	i have a hard time believing it would even it out, wouldnt really be fair to someone who has over 1000 PIO, and someone new comes in with rapid expansion and just takes away PIOs from the first guy


[23-Jun-22 03:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	it probably evens out the new workforce that migrated tho


[23-Jun-22 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I think it tends to keep workers where they are, to a degree, though some will leave, not enough to even it out, but enough that new bases aren't starved while planets grow


[23-Jun-22 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the balancing feature was introduced back before planet government programs were introduced


[23-Jun-22 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but it was also limited due to complaints in the last universe where someone would put a lot of money into growing high tier pops, then someone moves in and takes half that hard work


[23-Jun-22 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NoChadLee**:	im lucky. i have 315/315 PIO (with POW and COF) and 25/25 SET (with KOM and REP) .if the supply is stable (PIO), I will expand. however, I prefer to wait...


[23-Jun-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	i've also halted expansion, no point to it right now really. but i'm sure Xk37 is going to manage this


[23-Jun-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, be a couple of weeks before things get sorted out properly if I'm any guess


[23-Jun-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

**namazu**:	daft question but I'm new here. Do I need to do anything to make new workers appear or do they just magically fill up any buildings I place?


[13-Aug-22 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illiterati1**:	they're drawn from the reserve worker pool, on bigger planets and lower tech workers it usually doesn't affect you


[13-Aug-22 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illiterati1**:	check POPR, multiply the population of a worker by their unemployment, that'll get you in the ballpark


[13-Aug-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	that's right. when you first ofrm a base you get 200 PIO for 'free'. If you need more PIO, or other worker levels, you draw from the shared worker pool.


[13-Aug-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	*form


[13-Aug-22 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	as governor one of my main tasks is using the tax money to fund the population infrastructure to ensure we have good worker growth levels


[13-Aug-22 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	The higher the worker tier, the fewer free workers are available. As I write this there are 678 PIO, 255 SET and 22 TEC availalbe


[13-Aug-22 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	and of course Bert, our lone engineer,  still unemployed


[13-Aug-22 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Everyone draws from the shared pool. first come first serve until none are left. But then at the next Population report the is a rebalancing

**bazdakka**:	not quite all in, but close enough that 'details details' and metal is better for me


[27-Sep-22 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I orginally wanted construction, but with no real sign of getting that any time soon, I set up at OF-375C instead and build my constructor base there, running both PP1 and PP2 of metals in system, have to ship LST in though since local deposits aren't good, though I have a cheap supplier that I go to


[27-Sep-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	AL is quite valuable in MOR, while construction is quite valuable in HRT, this system is about halfway between them.


[27-Sep-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the fact the rest of my operations are more or less in the HRT region means I have my own RAT / DW/ C (decanally arriving as burnables) coming in among other things, as well as my own luxury good production for up to settlers, and this combo feeds my expansion, while other bases reed other needs

**marshmallows72**:	whats the benefits of joining a corporation


[27-Sep-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illiterati1**:	It depends quite a bit on the corporation, but it could be anything from reduced prices between corp members to goods being trading almost for free. As well if you want to do something like build ships, it's much easier in a corp. There are very few game mechanic benefits though.

**nunomer**:	ships are insanely expensive to build, aren't they?


[29-Sep-22 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes


[29-Sep-22 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the cheapest glass stl travel only ship is around 600k in cash, for a 500/500 cargo bay, that means in system travel only, no ftl


[29-Sep-22 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a starter ship is worth about 2.5 - 3 million


[29-Sep-22 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a large cargo bay (2000/2000) is worth about 5-6 million, estimates vary, usually near the higher end


[29-Sep-22 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a cheaper ftl ship, using a 250/250 cargo bay can be made for about 1.5-1.8 million...


[29-Sep-22 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	millions... i'm killing for 10k currently.


[29-Sep-22 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Sep-22 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	I know that GTU produces "ships", I have an open order. I wondered about the  estimated price  (5-6 Million) that bazdakka meant. Goaliehoffs components price Sheet will be around 3,2 Million fir a 2000 Cargo ship with medium Tanks and FSE.


[29-Sep-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**nunomer**:	Hello neighbors, I see that Berthier is run by "NEO Charter Exploration". Even the name must be given from them.


[09-Oct-22 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	The name cannot change I guess, but the government should be running by Insitor Cooperative members because it belongs to our affinity.


[09-Oct-22 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	It seems to be a spawning planet for new IC players. Berthier was on of the proposed planets when I started, that's why spawned here.


[09-Oct-22 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Berthier is inside the Isitor Cooperative faction, but I started in the NEO Charter faction and since I'm governor that's the faction for my corporation. At least I think that's how that works.


[09-Oct-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Or I mean, since I'm governor the faction of my corporation is what you're seeing


[09-Oct-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I chose Montem as my starter planet but didn't settle there and settled on Verdant first, even though it was not on the starting planet list.


[09-Oct-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	back then it wasn't anyway


[09-Oct-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	Ok. I wonder if it is purposeless to "role play" a little in this game. The values of IC are different from NC.


[09-Oct-22 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I think that may have been the idea at the start, but it turns out corporations give people plenty of opportunity for rivalry


[09-Oct-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Oct-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bazdakka**:	thanks


[16-Oct-22 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I thought I had the ratio right, and when 1 SME shut down, it was more because I'd recently sold some ALO thinking I was producing more than I was using... and because of a recent sale, I'd run the supply to low and timing of the EXT couldn't keep up, until the second SME shut down cause not enough ALO, then I realize my mistake

[10-Mar-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Harvey_UK**:	Yes... I assumed that was what people do, make something, ship it to a hub, sell it. Admittedly I'm new and not very bright.


[10-Mar-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ah, I was about to ask if you'd looked into selling your AL here. Then I just now checked your company and realized you're free, so you can't. Which also means you can't bring someone elses goods back on your ship.


[10-Mar-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Harvey_UK**:	Oh... welp. Nevermind I guess.


[10-Mar-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you ever decide to pay into the game and get Pro, you can post and accept private contracts. Even after your PRO lapses you revert back to BASIC instead of free. That lets you continue to accept contracts. So once you buy in you can do stuff like that forever, but it does require a one time buy.

**Harvey_UK**:	If I have to fold the company and restart, would the payment carry over?


[10-Mar-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'd suggest posting that to the help channel. I "want" to say yes since the PRO status is linked to your log-in account and not the company....but I'm not 100% certain.


[10-Mar-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Actually, nevermind, yes, it does


[10-Mar-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I forgot I had taken shipping contracts before my first and only COLIQ. That means I had definitely subbed before then....and I was still PRO after.

**Harvey_UK**:	Thanks for the advice and help. I really appreciate it.


[12-Mar-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I'm in DIRE need of 2 BDE. Paing 3k ICA each if you can get a LM ad or CONTD up within 2 hours.


[12-Mar-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Terrible timing. I just cleaned my leftover Bfabs off the base late last night


[12-Mar-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Terrible timing is why I need them to begin with lol


[12-Mar-23 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I just listed 2 on the LM for you, I'll fulfill as soon as I see you accept the ad, though I'm off to work soon so won't be able to check often

**bazdakka**:	I'll be employing a few engineers soon, just need to get the fabs for a HBM since I only need 40 (I have them, just at 2 different CXs so I need to find time to pick them up


[18-Mar-23 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	@bazdakka I can run an engineer immigration program for you if you want? It's 80k ICA and attracts 50 engineers. I'm not sure how long it would take to build up the engineer workforce otherwise. I've started partially funding the Wildlife Park again which should help, though.


[18-Mar-23 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	only a single cycle is enough, only need 40 on the planet


[18-Mar-23 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm using them to run 2 ASMs, which will eventually feed a SKF, though I'll cycle the SKF such that sometimes I'm running it, sometimes I'm running a HWP, going on roughly their respective repair cycles, to let the ASMs catch up, and the AL catch up respectively (since 11 SME can't keep up with a single HWP, and 2 ASM can't keep up with a SKF)


[18-Mar-23 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I should note this will also take up quite a few (though I don't think all) of the unemployed technicians, though I'd want to fix the lack of engineers first, I can send 80K your way to get priority on a single run of engineer immigration, after that, should just be population upkeep to keep them (hopefully keeping them employed will help with happiness as well)

[03-Apr-23 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah fair. Eventually anyway. For now I'm just hoping the WCB isn't out of commission for too long xD. Might just throw the LHP on the other guy for now idk.


[03-Apr-23 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Adding LHP's makes it go faster


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	As in, the refitting process....not just the speed of the ship.


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah they're both getting it but I have an MFL waiting for the WCB so figured he'd come first


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I assume you're making your own LHP's, right?


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	4 days for enough to fit a WCB, pretty nice


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm swimming in the things. Everything is repaired, everything upgraded, hundreds of them lying around that I need to get back to a CX and jam into "cold storage".


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	Yeah might not be a bad idea. Don't seem to be something that's gonna sell well so may as well stack up a couple hundred then tear down the HWP


[03-Apr-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup, once I hit anywhere between 500 and 1K of them, I'm exploding the HWP. That should be enough to last me until doomsday

**MoonSugarTravels**:	Stupid question given the current situation on ALO.IC1 but does anyone maybe have a little bit of spare ore?


[05-Apr-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	How much is "a little bit"?


[05-Apr-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	50 or so


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I produce net negative ALO, but I "did" import a crap load awhile back. So while I don't really want to, I can sell you some if you're in dire need. It's just not a source that would be available again later if you're wanting to pick up extra for the long haul.


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Nah, in this case I won't ask. It's just another one of tiny miscalculations on my part (I keep managing my company at the very edge, with minimum margin for error), misaligned my experts configuration and now I'm in a little pickle.


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, like I said, if you just need a little one off kick to fix an issue, I'll sell to you. I just won't be a viable long term source if your base is designed around running slight net negative, like mine is.


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Okay how much for 20 then?


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	4K seem like too much? I'm trying to remember what the hell I paid for my last import, and I can't even begin to recall, lol


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Make it 3K. Just looked at the charts. I can't imagine I paid up near 200 for them.


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	3k is sweet, CONTD me please.


[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Apr-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**bazdakka**:	nice, I'm advertising it's existence, it's right between HRT and ANT, but ANT O price is the lowest of the CXs, so most people just go there, my price isn't that much better than theirs


[18-May-23 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if I could get another LCB ship, I'd be able to deal with it myself, I'd just use it to fill bid orders at MOR, still very profitable


[18-May-23 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-May-23 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Shorewahtevs**:	I see


[18-May-23 09:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Just as an FYI, the O situation is driving me absolutely batty. So I'm dumping an O tap on OF-208c so it's close to my smelters. Expect to see some LM availability in the future.


[18-May-23 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you want to buy it off my planet, I have a base at SE-648C that has LM orders selling it in bulk


[18-May-23 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's at 110 a unit, and LM orders are up at a full starter ships worth of cargo


[18-May-23 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I have over 10K O there ready to ship out, I just don't have the shipping to do so


[18-May-23 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is enough to crash all 4 main CXs price on O if I could somehow ship it all out


[18-May-23 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I saw that up above. Was a bit tempting, but I wanted something more logistically feasible for the long run, and that's unfortunately a 24 hour trip each way vs 8, and shipping time is still paramount for me personally.


[18-May-23 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough


[18-May-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm trying to advertise it to clear it out, I don't care if it isn't as profitable as possible, I just want it gone


[18-May-23 10:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that planet makes so much O from RIGs that PRUNner says it's profitable at 50 per unit, but given I need HSE to repair on the planet, I have trouble believing that


[18-May-23 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	HSE's not even the expensive part of that rock vs the INS. Unless you're on a 45 day repair cycle.


[18-May-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, I take that back. Nevermind, RIG's get kind of mean on the 1 shot repairs, lol


[18-May-23 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, I make both myself, so it's not even really that bad


[18-May-23 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but it's the principle of the matter that annoys me about dropping much more under CX price


[18-May-23 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, to get me to bother picking up it'd have to save me at least 20K for the there and back trip, and that's on a starter ship. Otherwise the ship time itself is worth far more. So at 438 in a starter, it'd need to be 46 under the CX for me to even begin considering it worthwhile to go grab. So coming off of MOR right now it'd need to be 119 to even look like a break even proposition for my books...the more under that it is the more tempting it becomes.


[18-May-23 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which at 110 it is, but I usually link 10K to a single direction for 12 hours of flight with the engines cranked to the max, so 24 makes it....a bit less palatable, lol. Lots of people value ship time at a lower price point though, so I'm sure it's quite attractive for some folks.


[18-May-23 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'd have thought so as well, but apparently not, no one has taken any of those ads yet... I'm wondering if it's a case of despite my attempting to advertise it, no one is seeing it


[18-May-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that or they are basing the price on the bid price at nearest CXs, but I'm under even those for those that want to pick it up


[18-May-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Possibly, but I was wrong about flight time. For MOR it's more like 30+ hours (I was coming off a different spot), so it might just be genuinely unpalatable. Taking a ship out of circulation for 2 and a half days is a big ask for anyone without extra ships.

**bazdakka**:	fair, I thought half way between HRT and ANT wouldn't be that bad, I've done worse than that back when I only had my 2 starter ships, and 4 bases to service with them


[18-May-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	wasn't even that big of a challenge given the other stuff I was doing at the time


[18-May-23 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	back when I only had starter ships I was flying down to JS-572C to buy LST


[18-May-23 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I think it's probably because most of the smelting industry is around MOR. So it's more like popping from HRT to BEN instead of the significantly less bothersome flight of coming off of HRT. HRT itself is more like a 12 hour jaunt each way with the engines cranked.


[18-May-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, with the engines down which I fly, it's only 24 hours from HRT


[18-May-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Huh....


[18-May-23 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	OT-115d. Essentially uninhabited liquid O tap just off of MOR with the CoGC already built.


[18-May-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	wtf, no one has a base on the planet...


[18-May-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Probably moved over to WB-947e. MOR has no shortage of viable liquid O worlds


[18-May-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though there is still population there, so whoever had it left... means no first base bonus to happiness for the next person


[18-May-23 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	which makes me wonder why the price is so high, I know the metal works there go through it, but I'd have though if there was enough O worlds near it price would still be down...


[18-May-23 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean....if no one is on them.....


[18-May-23 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, but I'd have though someone would settle one of them


[18-May-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's a couple people on WB...but after you graduate from smelting FE/AL, the O consumption skyrockets. STL and CU just set the stuff on fire.


[18-May-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I suppose it goes into a trend I've noticed since steam release, people don't drop resource bases anymore, they all aim to move up the tech tree, no one expands to produce much in the way of lower tier goods


[18-May-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I actually have a feeling a lot of what went into the CX came from that base that died on OT.


[18-May-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It closed down almost exactly 4 months ago.


[18-May-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Which is when the price started going up up up up


[18-May-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	could be, that planet could easily put out 500 a day


[18-May-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It was running 33 RIG's with a CoGC, lemme go check


[18-May-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I just did a rough check, forgot to set experts or CoCG, should be closer to 780 a day


[18-May-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	690 per day


[18-May-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and I haven't got it exact yet...


[18-May-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	867. Forgot the luxuries


[18-May-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So yes, if they were pumping nearly 1K into the market every day and had the ships for it, that would be a huge hit to the market


[18-May-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that's what I'm getting as well


[18-May-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, makes sense, my planet is better, but it's further away


[18-May-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though I can see why no one has seen it, planet is a gas giant, needs AEF as well as INS, AEF aren't to bad, but any ship landing there needs 3 times as much fuel for takeoff and landing


[18-May-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	still very profitable though


[18-May-23 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I kind of have a goal that requires I move up the tech tree myself now, otherwise I'd set up a base there, I can make my own AEF easy


[18-May-23 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though with my own O tap down south, I don't really need it, but shipping up to MOR is more difficult from there, still going to when I have my next ship built


[18-May-23 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	mostly as a way to try and settle prices a bit


[18-May-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the planet I'm on can do 1440 O per day with the same set up, though I'm also mining the TIO and a bit of TCO on the planet so won't have nearly as many RIGs in the end


[18-May-23 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that could supply all 4 CXs by itself I think...


[18-May-23 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	ok, not quite, but it would be a large part of it


[18-May-23 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	In their entirety? Not even close. Make a decent dent.


[18-May-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	16% of the daily traded O on the CX... off of 1 permit... that is on all 4 CXs


[18-May-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Of course, then you have to ship it =)


[18-May-23 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	34% if you only do the 2 closest CXs, ANT and HRT, again, 1 permit...


[18-May-23 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, that would be 2 LCB ships flying non stop easy


[18-May-23 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	maybe 3 if I'm trying to do MOR and BEN as well...


[18-May-23 11:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I'd be down for buying O here if anyone wants to supply it. I consume 50/day at the mement and it's annoying to have to ship it in all the time


[18-May-23 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'll probably start dropping some off with the LST I dump over on Adalina, but I won't be producing saleable quantities for a few days anyhow.


[18-May-23 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is my current problem, I have a very nice O tap (by accident) and can't ship it all, happy to sell at under CX price


[18-May-23 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but it needs to be picked up is the downside


[18-May-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I see - just scrolled back - you're on SE-648c


[18-May-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, planet is halfway between HRT and ANT, price is under bid price of both CXs


[18-May-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	sold by the starter cargo ship load, happy with any currency really, I just choose ICA cause it's what I prefer


[18-May-23 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'll be on OF-208c....because I like the letters O and F apparently, lol. Also on OF-443B, and these are OF-375.....I love OF, lol


[18-May-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	of course


[18-May-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	for some reason I like the SE-648 system, I have 3 bases in that system, also like the HRT system, has 3 bases in it


[18-May-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and there goes the last of my overprices BSE off the HRT CX, I had them just under the MM price as well, though I see someone else has recently put up a large order at same price to try and stop it hitting MM price


[18-May-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, I ate...I dunno, 40 or 50 of them a couple hours ago. Didn't have enough on HRT to cover the base that I'm putting up in the morning. Stupid part shortages.


[18-May-23 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I know, I didn't even want to list those ones, but figured if someone needs them that badly it's better than the cash going to the MM, a bit like your N storage orders...


[18-May-23 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I still couldn't believe people were eating off of my N at 300/u.


[18-May-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I finally threw some up at 225 because it was making me feel bad, lol. Thankfully looks like it's been resupplied now....even if the price is still a wee bit high


[18-May-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I know, it's why when new people ask me on Promitor what to do next, I always advertise Adalina, since it's the best construction planet close to HRT


[18-May-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	even the BSE price at MOR is getting close to the MM now


[18-May-23 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to the point I don't want to buy BSE at MOR then sell at HRT


[18-May-23 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	at least RAT price is settling down right now, though I don't think it'll go much lower for quite a while


[18-May-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, expect at ANT, but that is fine, I have stuff to pick up there, just need enough RAT to head that way to sell...


[18-May-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	huh... a full base with 34 RIG, 10 HB1 and 2 STO would produce 1165 O/day.  That's a lot of (slightly) heavy gas.


[18-May-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	with the CoGC, etc.


[18-May-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	on OF-208c


[18-May-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	sorry you guys probably have worked that out already. I'm just catching up


[18-May-23 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair enough, I feel like that when I wake up and see 4 pages of messages in Promitor chat...


[18-May-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	we got onto the subject because I have too much O at a planet I settled for other reasons, but it also turns out to be an amazing O tap, I haven't fully built it up because I don't have enough shipping to handle what I have, and I wasn't even after the O in the first place... so I can't max the planet for O anyway


[18-May-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	SE-648c is pretty far for me... I never go to Prom or Antares


[18-May-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that got us onto the topic of other O taps, and a good one 1 jump from MOR used to have a base, but I'm guessing the person left, Zuul figured out it was about 4 months ago, when O prices starter rising


[18-May-23 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so then we both used PRUNner to figure out how much said bases could make per day, mine wins per day amount, but loses the location war so badly the planet loses overall


[18-May-23 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	my planet could, off a single permit, do 16% of the daily traded O on the CX from all 4 main CXs, 34% if I only do the 2 closest ones


[18-May-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	which planet is 1 jump from MOR that has good O supply?


[18-May-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's 2 jumps.


[18-May-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	opss, OT-115D


[18-May-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	opps*


[18-May-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Abandoned 4 months ago


[18-May-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	must have only had 1 person one it


[18-May-23 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If it weren't for the fact that I'm doing this specifically to supply Berthier, I'd be heading up there instead.


[18-May-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yeah I get it


[18-May-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	at 33 RIGs mining O, that is 867 O per day, if you dropped it to only 1 STO (not a good idea), you could fit 35 RIGs and get it up to 920 O a day


[18-May-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	To be fair, you could run it pretty easy with only 1 STO since a single MCB could drain it of it's daily production and still have available ship time on the clock at that range.


[18-May-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that would cover a large amount of MOR demand, but you'd need at least 1 LCB ship flying back and forth non stop


[18-May-23 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	possible, it is only 2 jumps


[18-May-23 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	we should have had this conversation in public channels, since not many new players set up here


[18-May-23 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Jumps don't really matter, it's the range in parsecs that adds up on the clock. That being said, it's only an 8 hour pop if you run the FTL wide open. So you can round trip it in 16 hours every day.


[18-May-23 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, I'd still want a LCB ship for it though, would let you wind the speed down quite a bit


[19-May-23 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, you can 12 hour it on leisurely settings, and still do it with only an MCB. An LCB would be major overkill, maybe only half it's uptime.


[19-May-23 12:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	give it 12 hours each way, give or take however many is need to make that easy, and you can do it fairly easily


[19-May-23 12:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, I might be lowering the margins a bit since I tend to overstock bases consumable supplies, even when I know I'll be back before they need more


[19-May-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Unfortunately, it's also a given that if anyone started supplying that much direct to the CX, the other sellers would do a race to the bottom to move their product, and quickly make it not worth my time. So instead I'll sell to various LM's and call it a day =)


[19-May-23 12:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yeah 12 hours each way with a LCB ship with FSE/QCR engines


[19-May-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if not for the fact all my permits are accounted for the next long time, I'd consider it myself


[19-May-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I have a spare permit but I don't think I can use it for that... have other pressing needs


[19-May-23 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though 2 of the cash spinner ones I have aren't fixed, I was just going to use them to try and settle RAT prices down, see if I can have a trickle down effect on lowering other prices


[19-May-23 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, my limits right now are shipping, I'm close to another LCB ship, I pushed that one to the front of my ship building queue since it's the only one that is likely to be finished anytime soon


[19-May-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, more like, I'm only likely to finish 1 any time soon, so may as well make it a LCB ship, that will give me the most short term shipping capacity in the short term


[19-May-23 12:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've got a pair of LCB ships in the works... should be done in a month or two.


[19-May-23 12:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	nice, I plan to get my name added to the GTU list for a bunch of ship building projects in the near future, I just haven't gotten around to figuring out what parts I can't make for myself yet


[19-May-23 12:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so don't know what ones I need to order in, once I've done that, I can add myself to their queue, with a note saying I don't want all 4 planned ships one after another, and they can space other orders between them


[19-May-23 12:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I'm sure that can be arranged. The GTU queue is speeding up a bit lately too.


[19-May-23 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I wouldn't worry too much about the components... you can always decide once your order is in which components you can make yourself


[19-May-23 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, they had a player that was a major part of their chain drop out for a few month due to IRL issues, he's returned and restarted his production lines, and managed to offload his stored stock he had queued before he left


[19-May-23 12:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	We just work our way down the list and assign the componenet to the next order


[19-May-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	only things I can't make for myself are bridges, crew quarters, engines, FTL reactors and FTL emitters


[19-May-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yup. also it forced a few others to step up so we're back stringer than ever


[19-May-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	(i'm helping the GTU ship effort, in case that wasn't clear)


[19-May-23 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	*stronger


[19-May-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	same, which is why I'm aware, I'm not part of the corp, just an external supplier that eventually plans to make his own ships without them, but in the meantime is working with them to help out a bit


[19-May-23 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	ah gotcha. I thought I'd seen your name in the ship building area. haha


[19-May-23 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I want to see if I can do single player ship building, with at most buying a few raw materials in, or only single stage processed materials (eg, buying FE instead of FEO)


[19-May-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	it's a long supply chain - not easy


[19-May-23 12:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I have quite a few intermate stages to ship building online, but I stuffed up the order on a bunch of things so I'm 6 months behind on a 3 month long project...


[19-May-23 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I can make most of the components now except for crew quarters and hulls.


[19-May-23 12:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I was supposed to be finished sometime around new years when I started this project, that is long since past and I'm barely halfway, I got badly shipping capped


[19-May-23 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I simply don't want to deal with hulls. haha


[19-May-23 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I did set up a HWP for a while, that was easy, hard part was suppling enough AL...


[19-May-23 12:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	exactly


[19-May-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	eventually I got far enough ahead to have enough LHP for all my planned ships that I shut the line down, and am just building up a stockpile of AL for when I reopen it next time


[19-May-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	downside is storing that much AL... I have 800 stashed at HRT since it has unlimited warehouses...


[19-May-23 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though I'm not on to 46 warehouses rented there, it's kind op getting bit silly...


[19-May-23 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	shipbuilding is a challenge I set myself


[19-May-23 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	actual shipbuilding, not just setting up a bunch of buildings for single use


[19-May-23 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yeah it's definitely a challenge

[20-May-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	I'm glad we're doing it as a corp now lol


[20-May-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-May-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-May-23 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Bringing that LTA in on my supply ship. Speaking of which, 850t/91m3 available heading in from HRT. 15 minutes until departure.

**N0ma13**:	it's gonna take for damn ever to make 100 AST isn't it.


[02-Jul-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	esp without engineers.. hmm is it worth to add eng?


[02-Jul-23 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	@N0ma13 Still learning the game but I assume you'd want 100% efficiency, 100AST seems very daunting to me lol


[02-Jul-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah without eng it's 1d7h for 4 AST/ASM. I have two ASM so it's gonna be a bit but idk maybe faster and def cheaper than ordering?


[02-Jul-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	buying/building ships is.. expensive.


[02-Jul-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	Yea not a chance buying that in hortus and moria is more expensive


[02-Jul-23 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	dang ship building seemed cool but maybe ill stick to building parts as a plan


[02-Jul-23 11:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	I say try to make some and buy a bit to see whats better


[02-Jul-23 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	yeah did a bit of both for the ship upgrade i'm working on and by the time it's done I may as well just build out ship prod lol


[03-Jul-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	why I run 2 ASM on the planet at the moment, I'll leave them up even though I've taken my SKF down now because I want to build up a stockpile for when I next set it up again


[03-Jul-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	when I finally get the parts from GTU that I can't make myself and have new ships I plan on moving a few buildings off the planet, and may try and set up a 3rd, or more storage, storing that stuff takes up a lot of space...

**bazdakka**:	I'll be setting up a temporary HWP on the planet soon, have a lot of ships planned and I can make my own hull plates here, but it'll eat way more AL than I can produce, I've been stockpiling for a while, but I'll chew through it eventually, so if anyone wants to sell excess AL, let me know


[04-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	I would love to but I just started and still going through the motions lol


[04-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	np, it'll be a while before I burn through my stockpile, but last time I had this up and running, I went through AL very fast, this time I stockpiled over 3K of the stuff, it'll last quite a bit, but some I had to store at HRT since I ran out of space here


[04-Jul-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	We could coordinate a rotating CoGC... something like 1 week RE, 3 weeks Metalurgy, maybe? It is a bit of a pain to coordinate but if we all agree it could help, maybe? Not sure how the math stacks up.


[04-Jul-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Would throw every base balanced on the current metric significantly out of whack. Not likely to make much sense for a single temporary set up HWP.


[04-Jul-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	true


[04-Jul-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I didn't catch that it was a temporary HWP setup


[04-Jul-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	But hey, nice to see a governor who sticks their nose into chat and makes suggestions =)


[04-Jul-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	lol


[04-Jul-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm going to guess "no" is the answer, but because of my base set up, I pull stock from my manufacturing planet before running through here and adalina on my way back to HRT. Anyone need HMS or PWO here while I'm coming through?


[04-Jul-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Vasyklo** left.*


[04-Jul-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	doesn't matter anyway, Berthier already runs a metal CoCG, and HWP is a metallurgy building, so I'm happy with existing CoCG, it's why I run it on this planet, because it already has the right CoCG, I was mentioning it because if anyone has a small excess of AL, I'll be able to buy it on the planet soon, as I'll run the HWP until I run out of stockpiled AL (and as I said earlier, that is about 3K AL, and with me making more during that time, that will take a while)


[04-Jul-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	@Zuul I could grab a bit of HMS, I use enough of them that buying spare stock of that either here or at HRT (to be shipped either here or other planets that need it) is a good idea


[04-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Of course you’d say it 2 hours after I moved on past =p. I’ll make a mental note to say something sooner the next time I move stock,.


[04-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Course, you’re on Adalina too, which is where that ship is bound for. So if you’d want them there I can drop off before I move on


[05-Jul-23 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I don't mind, I can also pick them up at HRT (the other planets that use it are Promitor, SE-648B (halfway to ANT), and 2 more planned bases near MOR CX, specifically Circe and Danakil, so I can save a permit or 2 at Adalina and make Rfabs and Afabs)

**N0ma13**:	wewt half way to my LCB. 200AST takes a bit. Next hurdle is going to be ZR though. I have ZIR but no AML.


[09-Jul-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	I have 2 AML on Montem but you don't need ZR for a LCB - its only 20 x MFK


[09-Jul-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	They're probably referring to the ZR necessary to build FF tanks, and by extension an LCB "ship".


[09-Jul-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	aye yeah need an MFL


[09-Jul-23 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	all I have left is the ZR and then finish buying the SSC and i'll be done with this project. This is just upgrading a ship but once done i'll start on the full build setup i think


[09-Jul-23 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	only bought the LFE and SSC for the entire upgrade

[14-Jul-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	ad on the LM now, 2100/u as that seems fair based on the 2 nearest CXs


[14-Jul-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I mine the TIO myself (and while I don't have any on the planet right now) to make the same things, since I have a base making it, I can easily spare as much as you want

[14-Jul-23 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I found a nice combo of rocks that get me TIO, TCO, BER, LIO, O which gets me a large amount of high end materials, and even nets me an extra metallurgy CoCG

**Zuul**:	You can technically make a local sale. You just have to jump through some hoops.


[14-Aug-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can post shipping ads at the CX. So you can place an ad on the CX for a shipment to be picked up here and cancel once it's been collected. Then use similar shenanigans to handle the payment.


[14-Aug-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nichus**:	That's good to know. I'm playing a bit too close to zero on the balance sheet to tempt my fate that way. Guess I should just renew my sub to sate my paranoia.

**Willger**:	Berthier... the home of my 2nd base... a long time this base is an important link in my company. But the requirements change over time. So it is with melancholy that I look at a slowly coming end of my Berthier base.  However, I would like to tell my Berthier story here....  Berthier... 830 days ago... my 2nd base is established, proudly, 80 days after I inaugurated my HQ on Promitor. Business with RAT and DW was going well. COF should expand my offer, for that I left for Berthier to mine N here. A small coffee roasting plant was then established on Promitor. Then came the RAT/DW crisis (from a seller's point of view), the prices suddenly dropped at all CX to partly below 40. The usual and planned profit melted away. The output of the coffee roastery could not absorb that. So I decided to build up AL production on Berthier. An industry that is rather unusual as a utility. The building materials were purchased from the last financial reserves and indeed it worked.


[24-Aug-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	The profit with AL to Moria CX saved my existence. For a long time N was mined and AL was produced, later as a supplier of STR for the upkeep of Etherwind, I built another BMP. As time went on, I no longer sold AL, but it flowed into my L-Fabs and Consumables productions. The mining of N was later not efficient enough, here was shifted to Biogenesis. Meanwhile, I am the largest COF producer in the PRUNiverse and 99% self-sufficient. Currently, however, the output of Berthier is no longer sufficient, to expand further I need more AL. The upgrade levels 25/26 are expensive, another base for AL therefore too expensive and so I will move the AL production to a base on a more lucrative planet in the Antares system soon. My aerea on Berthier ends.


[24-Aug-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Sad to see you go @Willger. Your story is similar to mine... except I started on Verdant rather than Promitor. In the beginning Berthier's small nitrogen production capacity was enough to bootstrap my coffee production as well. These days I just buy N from the spot market since I don't make much more coffee than I did in the beginning.


[24-Aug-23 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I ran my PP2 line here at first but shifted it to Danakil some time ago and devoted Berthier to aluminum mining and smelting activities.


[24-Aug-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Out of curiosity, which planet are you looking at for your AL production?


[24-Aug-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	i Used Berthier later only or AL production, Libertas is my Construction base for PP1, PP2, PP3 and WEL, my next base for AL is Deimos


[24-Aug-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	huh, different from mine, my idea was to run PP2 here to make my own prefabs, I quickly realized that PP2 made Bfabs were still to expensive, so set up on Adalina (back before it had a name or CoCG), and focused this planet on mining AL for awhile, eventually I set up several higher tier metalurgy buildings here with various goals, which will eventually lead to shipbuilding


[24-Aug-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It’s amusing to me that I use the AL here almost as a footnote. Most of the planet for me is just pure smelting for horizontal. FE/AL/STL/CU. Of course, way back when you earliest guys settled here…I don’t know that WCBs and what not were an option, so that wouldn’t have ever been something you’d have designed for.

[02-Sep-23 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pr0duct1v1ty**:	Question, I'm nowhere near trying but it seems like there isn't really any barriers to keep people from putting a base on uninhabited planets. So why is there not at least 1 or 2 bases on every planet?


[02-Sep-23 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Population infrastructure.


[02-Sep-23 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	A new base gets 200 pioneers to go with it, but population beyond that requires population infrastructure.


[02-Sep-23 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You can build your own, but it's easier to go somewhere that already has the workforce.


[02-Sep-23 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Also, a virgin planet won't have other nice infrastructure, such as planetary Chamber of Commerce or warehouses.


[02-Sep-23 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Long-term, it would be a very cool vanity project to build a colony from scratch though.


[02-Sep-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pr0duct1v1ty**:	Yeah it sounds really cool to try to build a new colony out in the edges but I can see it would be very expensive and very difficult


[02-Sep-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is also a case of not all planets are worth settling, when you open a planet window, 3 bars show temperature, gravity and pressure, if they are in the red, extra building materials are needed to build and repair every building on the planet, some of these materials can cost a lot


[02-Sep-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is also if the planet is a gas giant


[02-Sep-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	all starter planets are chosen with the idea that they are easy to settle, the only extra material needed is MCG


[02-Sep-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so, if you want to settle one of these more expensive planets, there has to be a good reason, sometimes, it's because it's the only planet that provides a type of resource (in decent amounts or in the region anyway, eg Adalina has cheapest access to FEO and as such FE for construction near HRT), others, because it is close to the CX (HRT B for example, only thing it has going for it is that it's in the same system as HRT CX), others are more niche cases, such as it's not to much more expensive than a good planet, and it's close to or in system to other planets that one player has settled a lot of, and as such, become valuable that way, but usually only to that player


[03-Sep-23 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pr0duct1v1ty**:	I see are there any largely populated gas gains right now? Because that sounds great lol


[03-Sep-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Sep-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	most gas giants are used as resource taps, which is a way of saying, the only use for the planet is to mine materials, all processing after that will be done elsewhere. There are exceptions to this rule of course

[03-Sep-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	All my resource tap planets eventually end up with other things on them. They may start with just resource extraction, but as I fill up the main planets I'll shift lower priority stuff to any planet with available space.


[03-Sep-23 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've got WPL and BMP spread out on multple planets, for example. I suppose I should look into considating all that stuff in one spot.


[04-Sep-23 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	Same here, its easier to put down a couple buildings where you have space rather than settling a new planet or using a permit for an extension


[04-Sep-23 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	That's why all my INCs are on Avalon lol I have enough FPs so process DW RAT COF so I have enough space for a handful of INCs


[04-Sep-23 01:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	That'll probably change later, but for now it owrks out


[04-Sep-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	interesting approach, I specialized my bases more, especially early on, and while it slowed my growth in some areas, it also allowed me to expand faster in others, while I've diversified more now, most of my planets still have 80% of their space on a single industry, it's just I've taken down some low level buildings and added higher level buildings in their places


[04-Sep-23 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Oh I do the same, I think. I was just commenting on resource tap planets, specifically. Like gas giants.


[04-Sep-23 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fair, I do something like that with Boucher, don't have any gas giants in my empire, but with Boucher, I also run INC (also resource extraction), a single EXT to mine GAL, and 2 REF (only non extraction buildings on the planet)


[04-Sep-23 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	most of my other planets are production focused, if necessary, I source materials on the CX (whichever is cheapest, I run most currencies these days)


[04-Sep-23 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	helps having a core empire that makes RAT, they sell well everywhere else, and enough of my high value stuff sells well in HRT

**Xk37**:	FYI everyone - I kicked off a Technican immigration program about 6 days ago which yields 100 new technicians. I am not sure when they show up - probably at the end of the program in about 30 hours.


[20-Sep-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I've also queued an Engineer immigration program that will folow immediately after the current program. That should attract 50 engineers 7 days later.


[20-Sep-23 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I'm also bolstering the Population Infrastrure going forward. Big thanks for Grundle for kicking in some help in that department.


[20-Sep-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	My goal is to ensure everyone has all the workforce they need, and.to reach some sort of equilibrium where we don't need to run special programs

**Xk37**:	The last 8 months have been pretty exciting for Bert the Engineer! He languished as the lone nerd for a very long time... Now he can (maybe) organize a D&D campaign!!


[20-Sep-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	Bert has 10 new engineer friends all working hard, he sat around by his lonesome all last week.


[20-Sep-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nuvolico**:	Hi, I'm using Set/Tec buildings without the Technicians, I'm just curious to know if it will effect happiness from the open jobs that I'm making but without allowing them to be filled.


[21-Sep-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	You'd think it'd matter but doesn't look like it does. It's showing 0% unemployment on techs. It may not be counting it because I'm assuming you didn't build tech habs


[21-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	they probably didn't build the TEC habitats


[21-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It only becomes an "open job" if you have the habs and work for the TECs, but the planet doesn't have enough TECs for you.


[21-Sep-23 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuvolico**:	okay thank you guys for the clarification


[22-Sep-23 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Xk37**:	FYI everyone - I've bumped up the production fees a bit to help cover the additional infrastructure costs, but Metallurgy and RE are still relatively low. I'm also planning on increasing the levels of the infirmary and possibly the safety station. Will continue to run ENG immigration until the workforce has stabilized.


[11-Oct-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Noted.  Fine by me.


[11-Oct-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	What were the Metallurgy and RE fees before?


[11-Oct-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lemme_Lick_Your_Grundle**:	Thank you sir for the update


[11-Oct-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I should have done a screen shot - I went back and forth a couple time ... I think RE and Metallurgy for PIO was 30 (or maybe 25?)


[11-Oct-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	All industries had the same fees for each tier.... I think SET was at 50, TEC at 75, ENG at 120 and SCI at 150?  Or something like that.


[11-Oct-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	It will likely take a couple cycles to stabilize and then I will re-evaluate.

**Filefolders**:	Do the toutorials to start.  Just focus on what you need to get started, as you don't need all the features right away.


[23-Dec-23 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If things just aren't working, consider restarting by liquidating your company (command is COLIQ).  An especially forgiving start is to be a victualler on Promitor, as it produces workers' consumer goods and is very close to a commodity exchange.

[27-Dec-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	when you click on a planet, in the planet info there is one line that states "Soil fertility", if it's just -- then it's not fertile at all


[27-Dec-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	just under the Environment info


[27-Dec-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Dec-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	If you're interested in searching for fertile planets specifically, a thrid-party tool will be much more convenient.


[27-Dec-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Dec-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Dec-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	but I REALLY lacked the CoGC filter, clicking on every system and every planet and every CoGC just to find a suitable base was getting tiresome


[27-Dec-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**GrayScreenEnjoyer**:	QQ: How fast/ what to do to grow workforce?


[17-Apr-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	To grow your workforce, you just have to build the workplaces and the housing to match.


[17-Apr-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	As long as the planet has the workers, you'll get them.


[17-Apr-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	On planets with more limited population, you might need to wait until the weekly population report for full hiring.


[17-Apr-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Berthier doesn't have a problem supplying pioneer and settler labor.


[17-Apr-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GrayScreenEnjoyer**:	Gotcha, thanks.


[17-Apr-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GrayScreenEnjoyer**:	And I guess to "create" population on an empty planet it have to have a governer & amenities build to start population generation?


[17-Apr-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	No, you don't. Land, build a base, set up production and they'll start coming. Visit the HELP channel to learn more.


[17-Apr-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You get a free 200 population for starting a base on a virgin planet.  Then you need population infrastructure.  Basically, pioneers need safety stations.  More advanced classes need even more stuff.


[17-Apr-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Admin complex isn't technically necessary, but it allows a governor, which allows useful recuitment and educational initiatives and so on.

**Slashing**:	AL seems to have become a valuable commodity over the last few weeks. Good news for us Berthierns. Any idea why the price has increased?


[03-Jun-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erasmus_**:	Not sure, but now I have to redo my profit calculations on products I make from AL


[03-Jun-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slashing**:	Same - BBH used to be my most profitable product. Now it's AL.


[03-Jun-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GrayScreenEnjoyer**:	L constrcution materials are in more demand hence more AL orders


[03-Jun-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**GrayScreenEnjoyer**:	Not sure where that actual construction material increase  comes from


[03-Jun-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I wonder if there's a way to look at new player waves and how long it takes them to start using more advanced prefabs en masse.


[03-Jun-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I've seen multiple waves, though, and this is the first time I've seen aluminum spike like this, so I don't think that's really the explanation.


[03-Jun-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	Previously active larger suppliers leaving the game, perhaps? Instead of a demand raise, maybe it's a supply shortfall?


[03-Jun-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I think that's more likely.

[03-Jun-24 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	Well, that's technically just ALO and not the AL itself... but yeah that's interesting


[03-Jun-24 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slashing**:	Interesting report - I'd never seen that before


[03-Jun-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slashing**:	I think it does show a reduction in production. The average production in the April report is around 34000 ALO per day, but in May it drops to around 31000. Hard to tell if you don't compare both months

[28-Jun-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Prom is definitely a good planet, unfortunately it is full so they only way to have a base on Prom is to choose it as your planet when you start the game.


[28-Jun-24 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	If you view the planet then you can see the available plots - for Prom it shows 0 / 422 (+443)

**erasmus_**:	Im starting to look into building a new ship and I'm starting to look into what it would take to buy / make a supply chain. And wow. It's expensive. Am I missing something? any tips? Even to build a duplicate of the starting ship is ... way more than I was expecting.

**TheEternalRat**:	@erasmus its not feasible to build your own ships to start. You'll def need to buy them from someone. Off the top of my head I know of GTU (corp), Riseoffilth (player) and Craftsman13 (player) who build ships


[02-Oct-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	You'd best check the UFO discord for postings from them on ship pricing and availability


[02-Oct-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	I know Craftsman has a waitlist of 4-6mo, but also the cheapest by FAR


[02-Oct-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	Rise sometimes has 1-4 week wait, and is middle of the pricing band


[02-Oct-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	GTU iirc has 0-1wk wait, but is also the most expensive


[02-Oct-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	Oh and there's OOG (corp) too


[02-Oct-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	here's a link to the discord channel with all the offers: https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1202242406494244924


[02-Oct-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erasmus_**:	That is very helpful, Thanks so much @xk37 and @theeternalrat


[02-Oct-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**erasmus_**:	I don't know why I haven't thought to join the discord yet, I've sort of just been chugging along doing my own thing for ~5 months haha


[02-Oct-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEternalRat**:	No worries, I only ever look in there when I need something


[02-Oct-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	The wait time has varied as individuals join and leave the shipbuilding group within GTU, depending on the component


[02-Oct-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Building ships is pretty intensive and requires the resources and production capacity from dozens of bases.


[02-Oct-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	GTU corp members have a pretty steep discount if they use our service, by the way, so if you're looking for corp then GTU may be a good option

**Xk37**:	Does anyone here have an excess of ALO? Or maybe someoone is running a mining-only base and selling to the smelters? I got an inquiry from someone looking for some kind of arrangemnet like that. PM me if you do or are open to it.


[13-Dec-24 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Anyone? I'm guessing mining is not very popular on a metallurgy-specialized planet.


[13-Dec-24 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**janmady**:	I have 600 ALO nr as excess if someone wants, but it's one time only as I have mixed other things in to my smelters.
