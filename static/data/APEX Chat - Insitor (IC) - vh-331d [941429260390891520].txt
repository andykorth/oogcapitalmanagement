**BF-Broker**:	What kind of business do yall do here?


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Well, chemistry? I make primarily PG and EPO, CL and TCL, and some FLX, NS, THF, NR, TC/TCS


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	DDT, NS and PG


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	[BUI CHP];   [BUI LAB] are your go-getters.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I do all NS, since I kinda need it. I do PG processes at Umbra tho. You can prob pick anything of the above, and you will be golden in terms of ROI.


[31-Jul-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Only PG


[31-Jul-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	The only chem planet with techs for miles, hope the players here understand how hard that is to do


[17-Aug-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	schaitr i get, but why not vote nomad if he's the only one doing cogc/popi upkeep


[17-Aug-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	seems like a stealth thing right now


[17-Aug-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

**xflqr_**:	Anyways, is there a reason for not voting the current gov that i'm missing?


[17-Aug-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Haven'


[17-Aug-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Haven't seen much campaigning, so idk


[17-Aug-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	Usually this kind of thing goes paired with someone missing pop or cogc but idk


[17-Aug-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	I havent seen anything here in chat, but it is the first time I have seen nomad in chat


[17-Aug-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	I have seen schaif and nala and jwest in chat


[17-Aug-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	seems the more vocal people get the attention


[17-Aug-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	But Nala has chatted more, that's true


[17-Aug-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	you can on discord


[17-Aug-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	more chatting =/= better gov for me though


[17-Aug-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	but yeah not just this caht but in general


[17-Aug-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	looking at last term it wasnt so bad


[17-Aug-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

**xflqr_**:	so doubt thats it


[17-Aug-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	yeah i dont see anything that needs to change so not sure why

**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	We'll probably get some sort of statement soon


[17-Aug-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ZionOrion**:	3 planets down?


[17-Aug-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nomadhunter**:	It's because I forgot to run until yesterday :p


[17-Aug-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZionOrion**:	My dad told me to never trust a civil servant that WANTS the job.


[17-Aug-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Talmar**:	don't have any here, sorry


[27-Sep-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Dzentaks stuff looks apparently covered?


[27-Sep-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'd recommend getting your stuff in-order. People commit these requests base on good-will... But if they become a trend in the long-term, it starts to looks less a of "goodwill thing" and more of an "eyesore".


[27-Sep-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Bro there's bound to be mistakes when you have 10+ bases, c'mon. That's what the chat is for. Besides, I can't see how offering to buy stuff for 3x the market value on an emergency is a "goodwill thing" or "eyesore" - sounds more like a good deal to me.


[27-Sep-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	it's more of a convenience thing as the person that made the mistake


[27-Sep-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	i'd rather pay in excess for someone else's product on hand than divert a ship


[28-Sep-24 04:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	Necessity it the main thing that drives trade. Mistakes are made, and you need to figure it out on the fly


[28-Sep-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	@roh is the most polemic person on this game, which isn't that impressive now that i think it twice because everyone is so chill here


[28-Sep-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	:D


[28-Sep-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	ooo, new words, I leik


[28-Sep-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you think that such "need based LM ads" are a good deal... You sure can take them. But the volumes of any of those ads, and the recurrence rates for their demand, is for me less of a "market", and more of what I said it being an eyesore. Those willing and able will sure take them, but I think my own attention is on the CXs, pretty much mostly. I barely pay attention to the LMs, which is why voicing out your thing in the COMG chat is a good thing!


[28-Sep-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I don't see much other reason for the planetary chat to exist than this kind of local requests. If your eyes get so easily sore, the mute button is up there I guess ¯\(ツ)/¯


[28-Sep-24 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you want to play Prun as a "single-player" game -- so be it. You woulnd't be the first one doing so either.

[29-Sep-24 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	you can play the game as you like to. If you don't wish to buy off the LM, then don't go to the LM screen. It's that simple.


[30-Sep-24 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	what are you all even arguing about?


[30-Sep-24 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	I think they are arguing about what one should do if one accidentally brings fewer supplies to their base than they actually need. One side's position is "ask in chat and put an ad on the LM in case someone has some extra." The other side's position seems to be "be perfect, or at the very least don't advertise that you aren't."


[30-Sep-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	Both are very compelling arguments. On the one hand, I am not perfect, but try to be. On the other hand, I'm not perfect and don't expect other people to be -- and have often filled these same types of LM ads because I happened to have the extra supplies they requested.


[30-Sep-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JoeRider85**:	I would also say that the types of chat I generally pay attention to are the ones in question (or any drawing attention to the LM). The other idle chatter is generally the stuff I'm just opening and closing real quick so that the COM thing stops flashing. I'm not sure I could ever be so bold as to suggest to other how they should use chat such that they conform to my needs.


[30-Sep-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	that other form is what the mute button is for.

[18-Oct-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	he wants a larger planet warehouse


[18-Oct-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	yeah but how many levels exactly?


[18-Oct-24 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	like, one more level shouldn't be an issue, but if we're talking about a lot of levels...


[18-Oct-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talmar**:	I wasn't the one asking, so I don't have an answer for you


[18-Oct-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Nahhh cmon, can't they just build a STO or two?


[18-Oct-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nomadhunter**:	i believe we would actually need 2 more levels to get more warehouse storage space. i think the even levels just increase the number of total warehouse slots and the odd levels increase the number of slots allowed per player


[18-Oct-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nomadhunter**:	its probably more cost effective to just build an STO though. a bigger warehouse would only get you 500 extra space anyway


[18-Oct-24 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	^^


[18-Oct-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	I only ever use warehouses when im gathering stuff to build a new base and when an "oops" happens


[18-Oct-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	and for the oops generally 3 untis is mostly fine


[18-Oct-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	but i guess one more wouldn't do any harm either so idk


[18-Oct-24 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i'll do my math to see how much 2 more levels would be

**CoinCrafter23**:	also, if anyone is shipping from HRT to here, I have a pair of shipping conts I need asap


[18-Jan-25 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We will be running a PF2 for the coming POPR - this will address Coin's needs.


[18-Jan-25 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	For the ENGs, we'll have to look into something else longer-term, either building up more advanced POPI and probably raising taxes for the associated inputs, and/or keep running ENG immigration to maintain the numbers. A work in progress


[19-Jan-25 12:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Can't wait to see who you intend should foot the bill for the ENG+ profit margins.

[23-Jan-25 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Do we think it would make more sense to keep running festivals or to upgrade the park to get engineer happiness up?


[23-Jan-25 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	I think the festivals run slightly cheaper, but upgrading the park might generate less pioneer and settler bloat.


[23-Jan-25 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Ideally we should keep PF3 in reserve, and depend max on PF2. I need to work out the numbers. Am also thinking of upgrading the INF so we dont have to use STR but the ROI will be long for that


[23-Jan-25 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	Mmm..., Running continuous planetary programs, in trying to keep some special ENG population on some planet afloat, is not a good idea, when none of your peers will join in with you, on this quest. You can check the POPR from 180 days ago... They all ditched this planet....


[25-Jan-25 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you want.... We can make this work... for a 10 --> 20 mil upfront capital cost, PLUS a 1 --> 2 mil weekly upkeep cost... We'll make Helion Prime Great Again... with particular focus on making it an attractive planet for AML + EEP bases... Beyond that... you can find better planets around, and divest those monies into FTL ships to do the work that you want.


[25-Jan-25 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But if anyone's wondering... We're talking about 1/5th, of 1% of the entire POPR of the planet... This of course involves taxes... I for one.. haven't seen tribute from @Filefolders, to keep my mouth shut. And since I can give you numbers... I actually have the maths. :P


[25-Jan-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Anxuiz**:	Shouldn't need to do anything special to support ENG at Helion. TEC education will support very low ENG happiness (education in will balance migration out)


[25-Jan-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	See, that doesn't work out very well, at all... TEC (out) education, supports ENG (in) education... Happiness is not considered.


[25-Jan-25 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Furthermore, there are various third-party considerations, like ENG requirements; for ALL bases on this planet requiring ENGs + POPI infrastructure maintained + POPI infrastructure up-kept + POPR programs.  Y'er just not going to make it work, aside from the wishes of that one player account that wants it so..l Why?


[25-Jan-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	there's 99.8% of the population that will literally be eating all of ANY intended ENG bonuses, to lower POPR tiers.


[25-Jan-25 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can either convince 1/3 of all bases here, to transition to full TEC, or ENG bases, or you'll just be dealing with the same stuff, as always.


[25-Jan-25 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	"haven't seen tribute from @Filefolders"


[25-Jan-25 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	Every time the issue of needing to raise taxes or needing to build additional infrastructure has come up, I have indicated willingness to contribute capital.


[25-Jan-25 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yes ^


[25-Jan-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I didn't actually read all the above, but let's just say I'm trying to get us where we want to in the cheapest possible way. It may involve raising taxes (likely since it's really low now), building new POPI (I'm upgrading INF to L5 myself), and maybe asking for donations (unlikely)

[04-Feb-25 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	How many do you need? The current slower trajectory was meant to help File get his, so it doesn't account for additional requirements


[05-Feb-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SamuraiThunderduck**:	It’s just a thought later for an expansion to the current base. I don’t have concrete numbers, was just curious about feasibility.


[05-Feb-25 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Definitely feasible, just how urgent it is and thus how fast we want to boost the numbers. I try to keep the unemployed to a minimum so they don't suck up the POPI inputs


[05-Feb-25 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CoinCrafter23**:	On the subject of populations, I will be requiring 250 pioneers and 700 settlers by February 15

[07-Mar-25 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you're likely to see a similar increase to the current popr (~+300)


[07-Mar-25 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	You could check the government calculator in PrUn Planner or Archiel's spreadsheet, which is its basis.


[07-Mar-25 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	@kvshman we're short 27 TECs now because someone added ~700 TEC jobs before the POPR. If we don't do anything, we'll have around +370 TECs next POPR. Do you need more?

[26-Mar-25 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	How many do you need?


[26-Mar-25 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	I believe that if noone has put new tec jobs in between now and the start of the last POPR, there should be about 5-600 TECs?


[26-Mar-25 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PurpleOrange**:	in anycase, as long as you aren't the one with 3 permits of labs, you should get at least most of your pops.


[26-Mar-25 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hectorino**:	how did you know i specifically built 3 permits of labs?


[26-Mar-25 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	In any case, you will get 61 TEC if you build something now. If you need more than that you can wait till just before the next POPR to build. If you need more than 610 TEC, you should le me know asap


[26-Mar-25 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hectorino**:	i'll need 640 more, but thats fine


[26-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	recently had increased demand for tec's at Sand - although our open jobs have driven at happiness above 70 creating natural migration, I've found Adv Edu 3 program to be fairly cost-effective in bumping the numbers.
