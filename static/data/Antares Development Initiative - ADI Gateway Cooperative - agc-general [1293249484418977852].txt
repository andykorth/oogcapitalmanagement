Question: how would the addition of a new gateway pair to the co-op interact with the shares? Are everyone‚Äôs shares reduced?


[08-Oct-24 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah my thought is that each gateway under the ADI umbrella falls into the same pool, and the shares are diluted by more resources being added to the pool.


[08-Oct-24 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
I could be convinced otherwise, but the idea here is that it wouldn't necessarily dilute your income, x% of 2 gateways vs. (x/2)% of 4 gateways. And it theoretically simplifies distributions- tracking one large list vs. multiple small lists. Also adding more gateways to the network should have a very ‚ú® synergistic ‚ú®  effect, so everyone wins when another gateway is added to the network. It also makes it easier for continual gateway production, which offers stability to producers.

[08-Oct-24 05:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think there's a decent consensus that a typical gateway in the program is going to have 1 volume upgrade and 3 distance upgrades, which brings them up to the max of 25 parsecs. There are some gateway plans which have shorter links, so that's fine, of course.

share dilution makes the most sense to me


[08-Oct-24 06:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
perhaps there should be a "staging" though, where your shares aren't applied to to the total until the gateway that generated those shares is completed

{Reactions}

[08-Oct-24 06:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
only a single or small group of people will be able to actually contribute to a gateway, so it should be easy enough to keep track of who has contributed what


[08-Oct-24 06:19 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think a single share for the cheapest item would make sense to me, then add decimal multiples from there


[08-Oct-24 06:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
and maybe a minimal contribution value? I'm up in the air on that, I don't think many people would only contribute a single thing


[08-Oct-24 06:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
looks like the 5k SEA would be the minimal contribution mat, so 1 SEA = 1 share, then multiply out from there


[08-Oct-24 06:22 PM] jcheung#0000
Will share values be decided at the time of contribution, at gateway completion, at each payout, or some other metric?


[08-Oct-24 06:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
probably best to have an agreed on value list that changes rarely. Any contribution would result in an amount of "staged" shares immediately, and then those shares are folded into the total number of shares of the co-op once the gateway is completed


[08-Oct-24 06:25 PM] jcheung#0000
So like a list of like, 1 share = 5k SEA, 1 share = 100 LDE (arbitrary numbers) etc?


[08-Oct-24 06:27 PM] realbandit#0000
Just noting that 1 SEA is worth ~110 credits, and you'll end up with literally tens of millions of shares, not sure if that would end up being a problem or not.


[08-Oct-24 06:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was thinking more 1 SEA = 1 share, but it does have that ^ consequence


[08-Oct-24 06:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's all in excel though so not sure if it matters üòÑ


[08-Oct-24 06:30 PM] jcheung#0000
Well, if you do share = SEA
how many shares would like LDE be


[08-Oct-24 06:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
hmmm there might need to be some math involved here


[08-Oct-24 06:34 PM] hernanduer#0000
ideally we'd have something like BAd + employment costs factored in for each part


[08-Oct-24 06:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
let me draw something up


[08-Oct-24 06:47 PM] jcheung#0000
Could do like... Whatever the most expensive thing is, one unit is one share. Everything else is based off that, with fractional shares. Any share value less than 1 is ignored during payout.
Though then that comes with two problems, how much of one material is equal in value to another... and what jappens if something has a significant price shift


[08-Oct-24 06:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
problem with fractions is rounding


[08-Oct-24 06:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
decimals never play well with computers


[08-Oct-24 06:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have some numbers though - based on a sell value of SEA of 120, a BAd of SEA of .548, and a consumption cost of SEA of 27.186


[08-Oct-24 06:55 PM] hernanduer#0000

[08-Oct-24 06:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
so we take the ratio of the sell that goes to consumption cost (which is anything related to upkeep like RAT, FIM, DW, COF, etc.) against the sell price, and assume that as the ratio of BAd's "value" to the consumption cost "value"


[08-Oct-24 06:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
the bottom right shows a share's value is assigned 23% from consumption cost of an item, and the other 77% is from the BAd it takes to build that item


[08-Oct-24 06:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
so an LDE in this case would be 67.352 shares each


[08-Oct-24 06:59 PM] razenpok#0000
What's BAd?


[08-Oct-24 07:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
base area days - how many of something can you make per one base area per day


[08-Oct-24 07:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
including ALL input products, recursively


[08-Oct-24 07:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
SST and GWS probably need to be broken down into constituents, and then share values applied to the later stages of their production. I think given the size of the GWS they can only be built by the contracted builder, so it would make sense to split contributions to a GWS' construction up in stages


[08-Oct-24 07:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's easy to apply a share value to those stages as well, with the math I am already using here


[09-Oct-24 01:18 AM] rek7137#0000
Regarding shares, what if we did something along the line of 1 Gateway = 1000 shares. New shares are distributed upon the commissioning of the new Gateway, and we use whatever chosen metric (BA-d, CX, etc.) to correlate material & cash contributions amongst those 1000 shares.
This also makes it significantly easier to adjust with inflation, as we never need to recalculate previous shares - just add 1000 to the pool every time a new Gate comes online.

[09-Oct-24 02:05 AM] rek7137#0000
Also, I noticed in those linked Co-op rules, it mentions that "Anyone in ANT" can join. What defines "in ANT" - is it 1+ bases in ANT space, is it that the Gateway must be built in ANT space, etc.?

Whilst yes it could be harder to maintain control of Gateways outside of ANT space, I believe enough people have bases spread around the galaxy that there isn't much point to that restriction. Especially as the majority of Gateways won't actually be in ANT space itself.

As an interesting data-point: the current Governor of Montem (Anxuiz) has a ton of bases in ANT space, so it is actually reasonable that the Co-op could exert influence there - especially if you allow MOR-centric members.


[09-Oct-24 02:23 AM] realharvey#0000
Basically anyone can join the Project. "Anyone in ANT" was used, because the Gateway wouldnt be of much use for you if you are not in ANT at all.


[09-Oct-24 02:25 AM] realharvey#0000
ADI is based in ANT. Having an ANT based cooperative building gateways in other regions doesn't sound very logical.

[09-Oct-24 02:41 AM] evov#0000
It makes sense - that people who primarily operate in the ANT region - would primarily be focused on gateways getting placed. . . in the ANT region.


[09-Oct-24 08:27 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The concept of shares, is just a matter of how the records will be kept. Share dilution could be an issue, since the most seemingly "profitable, or returnable, and cheapest" route plan, is between 2 CXs. Should any COGC based planet route be deemed necessary and built, well then you'll have a larger investment pool, which would then be cutting into the proceeds from the likely initial CX routes, potentially before "term".

The value of these "shares" is a different thing. In order for shares to be transferred between players, with a form of discretion... How would be they be valuated? If it's just per the share value estimates, then it'll be just a debt transfer. My true question relates to the potential long-term nature of it. If "share" repayment goes beyond the inherent items of "principal + interest", now we're talking about revenue structures:

```(Gateway route revenue per month - Gateway route fuel costs per month) * (1 - Prun Inflation rates) / Shares issued == A Monthly gateway share value, beyond "principal+interest" term.```

Do we then continue gateway to gateway "subsidy" payments to the next project, tender it as a "mature" financial commodity, or slash transit fees, to then allow the project to matriculate as a public good?

The centuries-old debt that's still paying interest
In the archives of Yale University, there's a 367-year-old bond from the water authority of Lekdijk Bovendams, in the Netherlands. And it's still paying interest.

[09-Oct-24 08:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
we're talking about a risky and slow return investment, I think leaving tolls in place in perpetuity makes sense


[09-Oct-24 08:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have also thought about dilution from the most profitable routes. In theory it wouldn't matter since the most of the same people are providing the goods, but the revenue share value of each individual share will go down because (in theory) later gates will generate less money


[09-Oct-24 08:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
lots of theory there


[09-Oct-24 08:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's something we'd have to agree upon


[09-Oct-24 08:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
alternatives are a lot more paperwork and can make things confusing - I find it a lot simpler saying "I own 5k shares of the co-op and that justifies me to 2% of profit"


[09-Oct-24 08:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
rather than "I own 2400 shares of that gateway, 2200 of that one, 2201.125 of that one and so I get 4%, 1%, and 3% of them respectively" and then someone has to do all that accounting

[09-Oct-24 08:38 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm still not sure I understand why we would choose arbitrary values at the top, you're still gonna have lots of decimal shares, and the smaller that peak value the more likely there's a rounded decimal somewhere and someone gets screwed over


[09-Oct-24 08:38 AM] hernanduer#0000
that's why I figure you choose the smallest item instead, and 1 SEA is the smallest contribution


[09-Oct-24 08:40 AM] hernanduer#0000
also there's not really any gateway-to-gateway share inflation here, small jiggles in the amounts maybe from consumption price changes but I wouldn't expect anything drastic


[09-Oct-24 08:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
right now a gateway totals about 1.87mil shares in my calculations


[09-Oct-24 08:50 AM] razenpok#0000
Is it reasonable to calculate shares in BAd once, and reuse the amount for the future gateways?


[09-Oct-24 08:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
if we do it only by BAd, unless recipes change that shouldn't change


[09-Oct-24 08:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
but BAd is only based on inputs - not worker costs or repair costs of the buildings


[09-Oct-24 08:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
those two variables are accounted for by consumption cost


[09-Oct-24 09:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, you and @rek7137  both have good points. I think the coop model only benefits from more players. Initially my expectation is that this particular group is focusing on the gateways in ANT space specifically. 

But it raises the questions- once we finish the ANT gateways, they really need the other gateways to be most valuable. So _would_ the ADI be interested in finishing and owning the gateways further in adjacent areas too? It would be a bummer if Hortus just never got it together to finish their gates, and we couldn't get all the way to the CX. 

If this program moves towards making gateways in other regions, then we definitely need to bring in a lot of partners in each region to hold the gateways under the program.


[09-Oct-24 09:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
It sounds like there's a bit of a consensus that we're focusing in ANT, which is totally fine with me


[09-Oct-24 09:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
Regarding: "later gates will generate less money" I think this is only true if 1) We're picking the best gates first and then decide to add marginal gates later and 2) The synergistic effects are low.

I think if we have one link, we might get X ships per day, but two links increases the utility so much we'll have 2.5*X ships per day through both links. (which is also speculation üòÑ )

[09-Oct-24 09:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Personally I don't have a preference for "shares". Either way it's a percentage of the gateway, and we're going to have _very_ fractional numbers no matter how we slice it. And that's fine. 

If people find "shares" either fun or conceptually easier, I'm all for it.

[09-Oct-24 11:22 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hortus just really isn't that big. There's very little, to no Shipbuilding done there. You've got HRT system; Boucher, Lemuria, and Nova Honshu to the south, there's a few minor production COGCs just around Boucher; Berthier/Adalina to the North.

Most of these COGCs and Planet naming around Hortus, are due to the Perlin/random noise distributions that the devs used to generate this verse iteration. They're few and far in-between, and PD-754 was just the last one to be grabbed, since it has no resource densities whatsoever.

Antares is rather nice, since you have like discrete chains of stuff, with each system as you go further on E/S.

[09-Oct-24 07:47 PM] rek7137#0000
Yep, my reasoning for 1000 shares was simply to make it more human-readable. e.g. rather than owning 0.00312 of a Gateway, you own 3.12 shares (milli-Gateways).
Can be 100, 1000, 1M, whatever - just a nice round number.

In my view it is better to use 'Gateway' as the base unit rather than a material such as SEA - especially as it allows later Gateways to adjust component pricing & donations to any changes in market rates, without having to recalculate for anyone else. Whilst BA-d is quite a fixed value, why not just go straight to what we actually care about - which is the Gateway itself.

Also, from a MOR/SuperNova perspective, we have now locked in our first links:
Our plan is to connect MOR to each of Circe (QQ-001b), Kiruna (XH-594b), and Curie (OZ-189c).

Kiruna and Curie are both highly populated planets/systems, and are essentially optimal CX<->CX midpoints even when looking only at speed. They will link in well to most of the networks that we have seen discussed.

Our plans after these first 6 Gates will depend heavily on how the rest of the galaxy has built out. If it hasn't already, we will probably build another Gate on these mid-points to help link in to BEN & HRT. We definitely want to have a good connection into ANT, but the final route will depend on how/where the ANT-space network builds out.

[10-Oct-24 06:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
you expand the area by 250 for existing base up to 1000 total area (3 permits)


[10-Oct-24 07:23 AM] evov#0000
This sounds like a more believable approach. Trying to get a collaboration together for a 16 gate network to connect all the CX's seems highly unlikely to succeed in the short term. I think each regional power base will want to develop their respective regions of space in a way that makes the most sense to them.

Ultimately any gates in the direction of another CX will still help with CX-CX transport even without the full "ring" being complete. It also makes sense that a Circe-Moria link is more desired for people operating out of MOR than any other link in the proposed CX-CX networks.


[10-Oct-24 07:57 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, there's reasons for why I only extended one potential Antares-area COGC routing, in the old thread, all the way down to Boucher and adjacent systems (plus FK-037 and LG-430). Of course you have the potential direct Arclight connection, but that's a separate issue. 

Having easier long-term access to expansion possibilities is a net positive. Most of those further out systems are less well-populated, for now. For not only the COGC access, additional resource deposits, but also for lower overall build/maintenance costs. Plot crunch is a more real thing in the long-term, than even the HQ permit crunch is. 

When most players reach a given level of A-fab upgrades, or business complexity, they will likely stop, and search for other means of higher rates of profitable returns, rather than dealing with the upfront costs for paying for the next and more expensive permit, not to mention the ships required, the operational stocks needed to maintain long-term stuff, but also the ship costs, and the administrative time needed daily, or weekly, to keep things going. Like up tiering production tech. But this part is a tangent..

The real issue, when you're going to be dealing with the dozens, to hundreds of new TRIAL/BASIC/PRO accounts who will be matriculating into the mid-end game, within the next 1-2 years, is that they will be looking, at least I hope, into the new opportunities for better production/sales that these gateways might provide:

- 2-3 mil AIC for a LCB/WCB STL ship, to then ferry stuff back to someplace else, that require MCG/SEA maintenance costs.

- 5-7 mil AIC for a FTL ship, to then ferry stuff back and forth, with bases that require INS/HSE/TSH/PSH maintenance costs. 

The first, "gateway facilitated" expansion options offer easier access to company development, while hitting the over ANT economy less hard..

The second will be cutting into the production realities, that the gateways will be eating from as well, affecting ANT prices and money velocity.


[10-Oct-24 08:13 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lets see.. Of the 38 or so new arrivals to say Verdant, since September 1st, only 11 of them were BASIC/PRO. 

The TRIALs are ostensibly locked into a x2 500t/m3 shipping limit, forever, however they might be fairly interested, over the long term, in not only being able to reach systems, based off STL fuel, and gateway-synergy (since their FTL drives have a definite parsec limit, due to their limited fuel bays), but also in the higher-tier production processes which definitely cut down on shipping requirements, while giving out potentially better revenues per week. So if they find what is to their liking, they will likely be using the gateways, and settle more-so on the more outer worlds. 

The BASIC have their own limitations. BASICs can field x2 max cargo ships, around the clock, but they also could field additional max cargo STLs, be able to participate in a good amount of association projects (if not currently), and have more available permits, provided that they do their upgrades wisely, and generally plan out/test their strategy.

True #PROs will just be given an open field to do whatever they want. I think we all know at least these things... But both stream into this final thing, being my actual argument.


[10-Oct-24 08:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There is a real information asymmetry at play, that generally helps to mold player decisions over the long-term. Some of you might have noticed this in the Q/A sessions that some have had in the more communal/lounge channels here. Others might have noticed this in their DMs when catering to the needs of their business partners....

Not everyone is entirely apt regarding making sense out of the whole barrage of metrics that say Prun-planner gives you, nor do they actually realise such things, until about a week, or a few, when actually implementing any business plan of theirs. Some of the public/private production associations help to supply actual needs; others help to drive down the FIO material cost data points. Both are probably doing the same thing anyways.

But you're missing out on the opportunity, to mould the operational decisions of a very large group of players (BASIC/TRIALs), who are likely doing things randomly, without much forethought behind it. **Maybe a whole whopping list, of ANT-area, five-star base designs at given COGCs, presented somewhere, could help with some of these issues** You can easily get such marketing material through those Prunplanner shared bases, with permalinks. Instead of asking for people to get involved, and guiding them through various concerns, you now have whole shopping list, of pre-vetted options, that will not only help to guide the larger mass of player behaviour down the road, but it'll be rather easy to snippet any questions which might arise from them.

It's a partial public/private benefit atm, since if people notice, you may get results on the CX, or in association production metrics rather soon-ish... It'll help later, when you can point people to new COGC possibilities, made easily available by a brand new and operational gateway route.

mmm, word salads. It's all that Ascaron does, other than providing RATs and DWs on all CX markets.


[10-Oct-24 08:32 AM] evov#0000
So, the tldr is - You believe there's a lot of players that are either restricted by pro/basic differecnes, or restricted by lack of information/knowledge. And you think that gateways can be used as a tool to help communicate to these players what/where to build stuff?


[10-Oct-24 09:05 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The gateways will likely open up possibilities for people to do what's already at COGCs of interest, particularly where gateways may be placed. 

You can do marketing for that anytime, regarding current means and methods. 

But the placement of gateways could influence long-term company development, and transit proceeds, through time. There's a whole rump of players who won't be using pre-built STLs for gateways, as is, but could use the gateways themselves for transit, to otherwise unreachable places, like Kinza - you need upgraded fuel tanks to reach there via FTL as is, from MOR. Boucher from ANT is another possibility. It's a one way burn on standard FTL tanks, without you carrying more FF in your cargo bay.


[10-Oct-24 09:22 AM] evov#0000
I agree, large FTL tanks are the better choice if you're uncertain of what the ship might be used for. But I gotta admit, I still don't understand what you're trying to suggest about gateways.

I feel like, there's still a number of unresolved issues.
1. Funding
2. Securing Ownership
3. Location of gates. ( I think the strong and clear declaration from Rek of the plans around Moria should make it easier to narrow down the choices for the first couple ANT based gates )
4. Production capacity - there's a lot of fairly niche parts that are unlikely to be covered by existing production capacity. At some point it probably makes sense to get an idea of how many people are planning to produce these different parts.


[10-Oct-24 09:30 AM] evov#0000
I'm pretty sure everyone is in agreement, that the first Antares based gateway link will be between ... 1 planet in the ANT CX system, and somewhere else. So if we can start there, and work through the problems available, it'll be much easier to close the loop on the remaining unknowns. So....

EoS
Bober
Hephaestus
Astraeus
ZV-307f
ZV-307g
ZV-307h
Phobos

Lets see if we can get a consensus on where the ANT link should start?

I think whatever ends up closest to the CX makes the most sense.... thoughts?

[10-Oct-24 09:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
I vote for Hephaestus or EoS. (Hephaestus high traffic, some parts need to be made on site or new cargo / EoS closer to CX)


[10-Oct-24 09:36 AM] marat_sh#0000
Since it's also needs to be connected to other system... EoS <-> 1.Griffonstone/2.Elon/3.Norwick/4.Harmonia


[10-Oct-24 09:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Eos is closest to the CX, Heph is also very close but has more actual on-planet traffic. So yep, either of those.

This should to help speed things up.


[10-Oct-24 10:12 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
As for gateway targets, there's a good list of them. The link-up with Rek's MOR area plans can be had at LS-231 <--> XH-594 (Kiruna/Libertas/Cortez)...


[10-Oct-24 10:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000


[10-Oct-24 10:16 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's the whole distribution, of reachable targets, via ZV-307, with max parsec radius. Anything else shall require more gateways, off-site from ZV-307.


[10-Oct-24 10:19 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
People should be dropping down notes on the gateway sheet, for material/money contributions, should they be asked for, then the gateway update drops.


[10-Oct-24 10:21 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ownership? Anyone who is participating in this project, and who has a base on given target planets of interest, should start to get into those governments, if you'd like to. 

Forcing down votes in functional governments, will be very disruptive, especially when the stuff comes out of the blue.

[10-Oct-24 10:25 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Silly? Maybe. No way to get STLs built on Hephaestos, to be working anywhere between systems. If you want the ANT <--> BEN route first, vote for the LS-231. Any current and working FTLs can just jump directly to all of those anyways. Else it's whatever floats your boat, since we're no longer talking of CX Gateway routes, but rather COGC routes between planets in ANT, and the CX.


[10-Oct-24 10:25 AM] tanda#0000
Deimos and Vulcan are not starters I think. They are already insanely close


[10-Oct-24 10:31 AM] laaxus#0000
why is deimos vulcan in that list


[10-Oct-24 10:39 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
They're all within 25.0 parsecs of ANT CX. They're all options for now or later. Those polls are for 24 hours, to get an idea of what everyone here would like to do, as the first gateway. It's a messy process...


[10-Oct-24 10:40 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
What if we all choose LS-231 as the destination? Well the next choice is either XH-594 (Rek's people), or UV-351 (BEN CX); Or just leave it as a half-finished route, and go for some ANT-area planet instead.

~~is LS-746 out of range of Benton, or is there nothing else of value in the LS- constellation that distance has been the main factor it is undeveloped?~~


[10-Oct-24 12:20 PM] kynadre#0000
~~I was just thinking since LS-746 is more central to LS, that helps the area be a bit more of a hub in addition to branching towards Benton~~


[10-Oct-24 12:20 PM] kynadre#0000

anyhow. to address your lined out question, 746 is out of range of 594, the MOR link

it's also just simply less developed

I see now, the map being just connections not necessarily AU, but as I looked more closely at connections in that constellation, LS-231 connects just as well as 746 would, but is as you said more appropriately in range + on normal travel path

Yeah that map is optimized for readable connectivity, but weighted to be approimately equal to their "true" positions. For "true" positions, use the in-game map, but it's pretty hard to understand connectivity there, so it's better to click around on the web map usually.

I think a lot of the sheets @realbandit  had put together were premised on the notion that a shorter gateway link would be "better". This suggests that longer gateways are more valuable since the savings becomes larger  with longer links.

Yeah I plugged in all possibilities from a "starting" position of ZV-307. ANT planets on that list don't make very much sense, if we're looking to stage not only a "statement" of regional coordination and association, but also the FIRST route option. Lets say we plop down ZV-307 <--> LS-231... And then somehow manage to coerce Benten people into guaranteeing a UV-351 <--> LS-231 connection, or something similar with XH-594...

Give it a few months, we turn over revenues to the shareholding parties.... Maybe we finish off the principal + interest repayment, for then original shareholders to have subsequent re-investment options... Will there be even more interest in helping to fund more AGC gateways? Will there be more STL shipbuilding to make use of an original CX <--> CX gateway... Could they be used in other places? If so, which ones?

Tonnage delivered is also a metric. If you wanted to build to KI-401, you're still looking at an Aceland/Elon gate, which will do double-duty for COGC related shipments.... These things should be considerations for the future, not "now".

Cuz that'll give indication of how OP the devs want the gateways to be.


[10-Oct-24 12:51 PM] jcheung#0000
sure but why only look at STL ships


[10-Oct-24 12:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Build x2 STL ships, for the price of one FTL ship... Without gateways, STLs are limited in scope. With them they can go wherever there is a route. I'm wanting to see the the fuel use metrics, so that transit fees can be calculated, to be cheaper than FF - FTL costs, but still confer enough min-maxing consensus, for gateway useage to be a viable thing for most players shipping along that corridor.


[10-Oct-24 12:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hence, more revenues for gateway partnership.


[10-Oct-24 12:54 PM] jcheung#0000

I like the idea of "gateway jumper" ship, but practically most people are still going to need FTL ships for most of their bases, they started with FTL ships, and it just makes sense to continue to make FTL ships going foward because they are more versatile and can also use the gates

Yeah I agree on that too... But give it... 2-3 years.... More gateway routes open. More PRO players then decide... Hey If I want to service this base... I'll just need another cheaper STL to do it, since the Gateways are up, and the prices for transit are fair!. I don't need to since x2 that amount for an FTL ship, since I need my velocity of money to continue to be re-applied to more permits/projects.


[10-Oct-24 12:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Pair for $597,697,414.93, 3 distance upgrades, 1 volume upgrade

Can always do later... Not that expensive either, as compared to just a default gate.


[10-Oct-24 01:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's hard to know. I think we'd be in a very good situation if we hit 200 flights per day. We have no numbers, but my expectation is that it'd be a lot lower than that.


[10-Oct-24 01:02 PM] .shiva.#0000
Yeah, capacity seems like the stat that's most annoying. Frustrating if you're 201, but doesn't matter otherwise


[10-Oct-24 01:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
If we hit the cap in the first week, we can pivot and add a capacity upgrade quick. It's only like 12m more


[10-Oct-24 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
also slightly off topic, i don't know if this was brought up for a possible ANT > HRT link, but...
ZV 759 > PD 175 is 24 parsecs. 1 jump to ANT, 2 jumps to HRT....
which is still 3 jumps compared to some other options like ANT > PD 754/518 / UB 282...
but it brings a potential single red H producer basically next door to one of our fuel COCG planets (759e) for a STL link (looking at you Roh)


[10-Oct-24 01:08 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

[10-Oct-24 01:16 PM] jcheung#0000
especially if this particular gate pair were basically for inter-CX transit, the gates could be put out in the sticks for their respective systems since most of the CX traffic will be FTL

You've got personalities, here and everywhere. Y'all need to interact, otherwise you'll end up with the same b's, like on the APEX Global Chat COMG... Lots of randomness everywhere, and no one really knows who they're dealing with (since many people play PRUN like it's a solo game --- lots of nerves wracked, for no good reason).


[10-Oct-24 01:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And these gateways will be bringing in permutations into the landscape of meta-stuff.... (factorials in other words  [3! == 3x2x1 == 6 possibilities)... Even for an ANT <--> HRT route, we've got PD-754, via LS-231, or via ZV-759, or via LS-300, or via IA-603, or SE-110, and that's just mentioning the ANT side of things... MOR/BEN corps probably will have their own designated points of entry into PD-754, like XH-594, XH-400, KW-688, or OZ-189. All of those can have their own, non-CX gateway routes as well, since most COGC dependencies, are set in-stone with I/Os from one COGC to another, and those are set by the devs upon universe creation.

I'd rather not tread on that. It's just an example to show that whatever group is planning similar things, have rather serious issues as well.


[10-Oct-24 01:53 PM] jcheung#0000
is distance upgrade 5 parsec per upgrade? so 10/15/20/25?


[10-Oct-24 01:54 PM] realbandit#0000
Nice find!
This is some interesting information, if links are indeed made a set time then we can swap our 'distances' for 'number of links' for the 6 CX connections for each design.
In which case, slight optimizations for overall length are irrelevent, and we can choose them entirely from the value of the midpoint.
It does bring considerable value back to the original plan using PD-754 for the diagonal, as that makes the routes of length 2,2,3,3 and then 3,3 for the diagonals, in comparison to 2,2,2,2 and then 3,3 for the diagonals. So most of the inefficiencies that design brought are removed, and an option to add in 4 more links after to bring it to identical would make it identical to any other design in terms of speed - but saving 1 link in total still.
However XH-400 is still a problem as the midpoint for that design, but it does raise it's viability in my opinion.


[10-Oct-24 01:54 PM] realbandit#0000
Yes


[10-Oct-24 01:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Correct


[10-Oct-24 02:00 PM] jcheung#0000
754 won't work well with MOR gate being at 594 for STL only, but would be fine with FTL


[10-Oct-24 02:01 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or just drop XH-400 entirely... That system looks entirely "depreciated". Prophetar started the buildup at Aratora - LS-231, to be a kingpin for NS production, between, BEN and ANT, but they had to abandon it due to shipping issues. 

It could to double-duty as a viable COGC site, along with a gateway route intersection, avoiding more troublesome places like XH-400.


[10-Oct-24 02:01 PM] jcheung#0000
unless that's done independently of each other


[10-Oct-24 02:03 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
With LS-231, you're looking at a regional anchor, to not only permit XH-594, but also PD-754, and with COGC possibilities.


[10-Oct-24 02:04 PM] realbandit#0000
Yeah, I'm refering to the old design that was suggested with PD-754 and XH-400 as the only 2 midpoints.
It was far slower for most routes using our old assumptions, but this new information changes that significantly.


[10-Oct-24 02:04 PM] jcheung#0000
this one yeah?

what is at Kw-358?


[10-Oct-24 02:06 PM] realbandit#0000
Better shows the actual route, and the blue lines would be the later links to make it identical (using all Links as set time to travel) to any other design.


[10-Oct-24 02:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm trying to work in COGC synergies, so that we can have viable options for not only productivity, but also for political office (which will be required for transit fee payouts --- its complex :/)

[10-Oct-24 02:09 PM] realbandit#0000
The good news is that we can use the optimal midpoints design to get OZ-189, XH-594 and LS-300 as the midpoints. Would normally be far slower, but it creates the 2,2,2,2,3,3 links that we need. And the ANT<>HRT spot just has to reach both LS-300 and OZ-189, but there weren't any popular midpoints there before anyway to worry about.


[10-Oct-24 02:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think it's helpfult to know the sum of the distances of the FTL jumps, to know the savings there, just not to compare gateway lengths. So it's valuable information. We know FTL ship jump durations are proportional to length... so we can use that to know how much time we are saving with a gateway link:

[10-Oct-24 02:10 PM] realbandit#0000
Most of our tests have compared it to FTL - though that was mainly for seeing which gates to build first to save the most initially, it's less useful for a completed CX link, only for branching routes at that point.


[10-Oct-24 02:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
LS-300 does not work with XH-594.. LS-231 does.


[10-Oct-24 02:11 PM] realbandit#0000
The ANT<>MOR connection would go through the south west


[10-Oct-24 02:11 PM] realbandit#0000
Slower, but that doesn't matter if a link is a set time.


[10-Oct-24 02:11 PM] realbandit#0000
But thats why the regular design has to use LS-231 instead of LS-300


[10-Oct-24 02:12 PM] realbandit#0000
Both were popular, but 300 does edge out 231, so this just makes that easier to justify


[10-Oct-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
System pop of LS-300 is 152,000, LS-231 has just under 9000 workers. They are near each other so they both have value. LS-231 is closer to Etherwind as an interm travel point that is popular among antarens


[10-Oct-24 02:17 PM] realbandit#0000
yeah, it was surprising to me that many people voted 231 too


[10-Oct-24 02:17 PM] archielvahr#0000

It did, but the new info changes that drasticallly


[10-Oct-24 02:19 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Not only in economics, but also military strategy (if ever implemented in Prun). You get natural efficiencies, with the best choices for hosting large-scale transportation. If you're on the sea, you benefit from cheap seaport possibilities, if you have natural harbors... If you're on flat lands, you can easily install railways, without too much financial discomfort.


[10-Oct-24 02:25 PM] realbandit#0000
Not sure what you're getting at with that, but that was entirely how we were working at the routes before, weighing up midpoints, total lengths, costs, etc.
The main discussion here is about if the devs implement this set time to travel a link, which negates several of those factors and makes it a whole lot simpler to decide.


[10-Oct-24 02:29 PM] jcheung#0000
i voted there because of the options in the poll it was the only one that linked with the proposed MOR gate


[10-Oct-24 02:30 PM] jcheung#0000
so for me it was between 603 and 231


[10-Oct-24 02:30 PM] realbandit#0000
?
ANT<>MOR can go either north or south, and south is actually faster mostly


[10-Oct-24 02:30 PM] jcheung#0000
603 being a HRT link


[10-Oct-24 02:30 PM] realbandit#0000
The midpoints question was just that, about that midpoints specifically


[10-Oct-24 02:31 PM] jcheung#0000
given the constraints of only the options of the poll, 231 was the only one to connect to the proposed MOR network terminating at 594

Well I guess I need to have phrased that question better than lol
alright though, makes sense


[10-Oct-24 02:33 PM] realbandit#0000
The poll was created with no set route in mind, so LS-300 could have connected via XH-400, if say LS-300 and XH-400 both got 30 votes, and XH-594 and LS-231 got none.


[10-Oct-24 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
i was also going off the assumption that 400 was off the table since 549 was 'locked in'


[10-Oct-24 02:36 PM] realbandit#0000
594 was only just 'locked in' for us now, that poll was created weeks ago


[10-Oct-24 02:37 PM] realbandit#0000
The responses to the poll are what made us decide to 'lock' 594 in


[10-Oct-24 02:38 PM] jcheung#0000
...are we talking about the same poll? ü§î i wonder if we're talking about the same thing. i was talking about the one Roh posted earlier today


[10-Oct-24 02:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You just answered your own query. Mathematically based efficiencies will denote the most efficient branches of any gateway network... They will also point out what's ideal, but will not necessary point out what's enforceable, like with the option of XH-400... How many of you have bases on XH-400? I'm guessing no one. 

We're striving for not only the ideal (least gateways required), but also what's most enforceable (most COGCs in-between anything, ensuring some sort of overlap, for GOV control of gateways, since people would like the most "efficient" COGCs to plant bases on, and thus provide political votes).


[10-Oct-24 02:39 PM] realbandit#0000

[10-Oct-24 02:43 PM] realbandit#0000
hmm, now thats interesting.
That would make more sense to be based off of the 594 results then - though the south-west route is still viable via PD-518, I'd have to check distances, but if we use the new dev info that won't matter, as long as it's 3 links


[10-Oct-24 02:45 PM] jcheung#0000

I myself would like a tangible product... ANT <--> BEN is like 1 bil AIC... Anything else confers at least x3 as much, when you do the subsequent votings for who would like what, where, and when... We should like a minimally viable product, though, which is a CX route, to/from ANT. 4 gates max.


[10-Oct-24 02:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
My math is very subtle. You've got 7 project coordinators here... 2 server boosters, and 51 project members. Should say everyone give a random polling answer, the stuff will be all over the place --- this is sort of the point; if everyone here would have like 1 bil in materials to donate, you'd have gateways all over the place, contributing to each person's particular interest... But you/we don't have such things on-call right now. Shoot for the easiest target being a CX <--> CX route, or shoot elsewhere. Everything elsewhere has an eventual material multiplier of 2+... 

Of course, if few vote, or if few have inclination to reach/contribute to the "lowest-hanging-fruit", this should be an indication for more discussion, debate, or whatnot.


[10-Oct-24 03:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Evov called for an address of his concerns, if they not be another person's issues, stemming from the month's long banter from the previous thread.

[10-Oct-24 08:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
One thought regarding shares is that not every gateway we create will have the same materials or cost. So if I put, for example, 1000 shares per gateway, then contributions per gateway would be unequal. We'll likely end up making some gateways with 3 distance upgrades and some with 2. 

I could normalize the shares based on the "standard" 3 distance, 1 volume gateway. That would work fine, but be aware none of the numbers (including total share count) will be a round number. I'm fine with that though.


[10-Oct-24 08:05 PM] jcheung#0000
You could split it into shares for base, shares for each upgrade type


[10-Oct-24 08:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Do you mean different classes of shares?


[10-Oct-24 08:33 PM] jcheung#0000
For some arbitrary numbers 
Base gate 1000 shares
Distance upgrade 100 shares 
Capacity upgrade 75 shares

So gate with 3 distance one capacity would be 1375 total shares

{Reactions}

[10-Oct-24 08:34 PM] jcheung#0000
(Assuming d1 and d3 are same cost to upgrade ofc)


[10-Oct-24 08:35 PM] jcheung#0000
That way you don't have to worry about the shares between a distance 2 and 3 gate being skewed in favor of one


[10-Oct-24 08:36 PM] jcheung#0000
Can also apply that to gate usage fees, base + upgrades + fuel cost


[10-Oct-24 08:44 PM] realbandit#0000
Your idea is good, should allow shares to be tracked easily.
Numbers are listed on Gateway Tiers in the co-op sheet, but each cost increases over the last, so total upgrade cost ends up at 1, 3, 6, 10, 15x the price of the 1st level.
So following the 1000, 100 and 75 scale, the Distance 3 and Capacity 1 Gate would be 1675 shares in total.


[10-Oct-24 10:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's not fair with actual costs though


[10-Oct-24 10:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
also it still results in fractional shares


[10-Oct-24 10:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
so I don't really understand about picking nice even values


[10-Oct-24 10:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's a numbers game, some BIG numbers shouldn't scare you üòÑ


[10-Oct-24 10:27 PM] tanda#0000
0.00015293 shares of a gateway definitely is going to be keeping me awake tonight


[10-Oct-24 11:00 PM] jcheung#0000
so what would you propose that has no fractional shares?


[10-Oct-24 11:00 PM] jcheung#0000
because i don't think it's possible


[10-Oct-24 11:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah I didn't mean to imply I have a solution to that


[10-Oct-24 11:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
but rather we should avoid very small fractions


[10-Oct-24 11:01 PM] jcheung#0000
unless you assign one share per credit, of the material and lock that in, you have fractional


[10-Oct-24 11:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
computers don't do them very well


[10-Oct-24 11:01 PM] jcheung#0000
the way to avoid very small fractions would be to make each gate worth more shares


[10-Oct-24 11:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's why I recommend starting with 1 share as the smallest single material contribution


[10-Oct-24 11:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's exactly what I was saying earlier


[10-Oct-24 11:02 PM] jcheung#0000
computers don't handle very large numbers well either though


[10-Oct-24 11:02 PM] hernanduer#0000

179.94 shares


[10-Oct-24 11:05 PM] jcheung#0000
the limit between a very large and very small number should be about the same number of characters unless i misunderstand things horribly


[10-Oct-24 11:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
nah the way numbers work is by significant digits


[10-Oct-24 11:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
so a typical 32 bit number gives you 7 significant digits


[10-Oct-24 11:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
if a gateway is 1500 shares and someone has 102.5423 shares, they've reached the limit of significands


[10-Oct-24 11:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
any fractional share after that will disappear basically - I'd rather we actually just round off shares once owned


[10-Oct-24 11:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
so they're all ints


[10-Oct-24 11:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
say you provide 50 RDE at 179.94 shares = 8997 (okay bad example), say 49 shares instead it'll be 8817.06


[10-Oct-24 11:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
but round it down to 8817


[10-Oct-24 11:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
that way they're always tracked exactly, and when we have 10 gateways under management and the numbers are getting quite a lot of significands, it won't matter because they're ints


[10-Oct-24 11:09 PM] jcheung#0000
first of all, your image above has decimals extending past ten-thousandths


[10-Oct-24 11:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
also this is all in excel/sheets, which is notorious for rounding numbers badly


[10-Oct-24 11:09 PM] jcheung#0000
so why would it just 'vanish'


[10-Oct-24 11:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay well let's say it's 1500 instead, right? let's look at what that looks like


[10-Oct-24 11:10 PM] jcheung#0000
where would the "excess" go?


[10-Oct-24 11:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
no where, it's all totaled together so the excess is just cut off


[10-Oct-24 11:11 PM] jcheung#0000
right


[10-Oct-24 11:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
over time it'd average out for any person making multiple contirbutiosn

[10-Oct-24 11:11 PM] jcheung#0000
so if all the player shares add up to 9993 out of 10000 what happens to the extra 7 shares


[10-Oct-24 11:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
the column on the right is the same share scheme scaled down to 1500 shares


[10-Oct-24 11:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
.000801 share


[10-Oct-24 11:12 PM] jcheung#0000
you're rounding by choice


[10-Oct-24 11:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
my point is more that the number is very small


[10-Oct-24 11:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
what is the benefit of that?


[10-Oct-24 11:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
and the total adjusts down to 9993


[10-Oct-24 11:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
the total is a running amount - not some set figure


[10-Oct-24 11:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
I picture there being a ledger, the contribution, and the shares given for that contribution


[10-Oct-24 11:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
then tolls are dolled out by a percent of that contribution over all active shares


[10-Oct-24 11:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
the "total" number of shares is a moving value


[10-Oct-24 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. sure. even if we say that a gate total share is in the millions... you still have very small numbers


[10-Oct-24 11:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
well not really


[10-Oct-24 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
well yes really


[10-Oct-24 11:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
so aggressive


[10-Oct-24 11:15 PM] jcheung#0000
let's say you use the numbers as is


[10-Oct-24 11:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
the fractions can go really far


[10-Oct-24 11:16 PM] jcheung#0000
with 1.8m shares


[10-Oct-24 11:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
but that number isn't small


[10-Oct-24 11:16 PM] jcheung#0000
5k SEA is .00267308063 payout


[10-Oct-24 11:16 PM] jcheung#0000
it's still .00267308063 of the payout even at 1.5k shares


[10-Oct-24 11:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
as a percent? yeah the percent doesn't change, but you track the shares not percents


[10-Oct-24 11:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
the coop has more than 1 gate


[10-Oct-24 11:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
so per gate the percent might not change


[10-Oct-24 11:17 PM] jcheung#0000
so you're fine with tracking 11 decimal digits for one number but not for another?


[10-Oct-24 11:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
but if you have two gates, percent is now half


[10-Oct-24 11:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
no because you don't track the percents, I just said that


[10-Oct-24 11:17 PM] jcheung#0000
well you said that computers can't handle very small numbers


[10-Oct-24 11:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
the more significant digits the more muddled it gets, yeah


[10-Oct-24 11:18 PM] hernanduer#0000
they start approximating


[10-Oct-24 11:18 PM] jcheung#0000
the only approximation i've seen with small numbers has been you choosing a cutoff and applying it


[10-Oct-24 11:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm sort of catching up here, I think we should do 100 AIC = 1 Share (or 1 or 1000, whatever)


[10-Oct-24 11:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
also with floating point numbers, it doesn't really matter which side of the decimal point the digits are on, the accuracy is the same


[10-Oct-24 11:19 PM] jcheung#0000
that's what i'm saying


[10-Oct-24 11:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
well that's why I was talking about dropping them to integer


[10-Oct-24 11:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
to do that, you really need the decimals to not be that valuable


[10-Oct-24 11:20 PM] jcheung#0000
my only issue with assigning it to credit value is that then each gate is worth a different number of shares


[10-Oct-24 11:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
and 1 share = 100AIC is pretty close to 1 share = 1 SEA


[10-Oct-24 11:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
funny enough


[10-Oct-24 11:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
why shouldn't they be?


[10-Oct-24 11:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
the parts are worth different things at different times


[10-Oct-24 11:21 PM] jcheung#0000
because the hard material costs are the same for the same design


[10-Oct-24 11:21 PM] tanda#0000
Considering AIC costs fluctuate, wouldn't it be better to assign shares based on BAd?


[10-Oct-24 11:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's what my math does right now, it's about 75% BAd and 25% AIC's current value


[10-Oct-24 11:22 PM] jcheung#0000
if you start with, let's up the arbitrary numbers by 3 orders of magnitude to make you happy, 1,000,000 shares for the base gate and then some other fixed values for each upgrade


[10-Oct-24 11:23 PM] jcheung#0000
you can then take the materials donated and assign them shares based on the current cost of materials, with total shares equal to whatever the module is-in this case 1m shares for the base module


[10-Oct-24 11:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I agree- I strongly advocate for fixing the prices you are credited for because it's a pretty serious burden to attempt to track the price at he time of contribution is a lost cause. I'd be happy with BAd or a fixed price relative to the CX price. BAd prices don't always reflect the CX price super well.


[10-Oct-24 11:24 PM] jcheung#0000
instead of having 1.1m shares for gate 1, then 1.4m shares for gate 2, then 800k shares for gate 3


[10-Oct-24 11:24 PM] jcheung#0000
no matter what though you'll have to still track partial shares


[10-Oct-24 11:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
my current calculations of BAd don't include repair or consumption costs


[10-Oct-24 11:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's why there's the ~25% AIC tracking - it's coming through in those costs


[10-Oct-24 11:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
.5 of a share in this scheme is about 60 AIC


[10-Oct-24 11:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'd never get rounded down more than .5 of a share


[10-Oct-24 11:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
I strongly advocate for integer shares


[10-Oct-24 11:28 PM] jcheung#0000
that's fine, if you just multiply the arbitrary numbers here by a thousand that gets you close to your share values


[10-Oct-24 11:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I think this is what @jcheung is advocating for, do I have it correct?

[10-Oct-24 11:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sorry, rightmost column is "total shares"


[10-Oct-24 11:29 PM] jcheung#0000
something like that.


[10-Oct-24 11:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'd rather do it by whole part lists


[10-Oct-24 11:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
and to facilitate integers, you have to peg the smallest value contributable as 1


[10-Oct-24 11:32 PM] hernanduer#0000
otherwise people get screwed


[10-Oct-24 11:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it'll get summed either way and presented to people as a total number


[10-Oct-24 11:32 PM] jcheung#0000
it could be a billion for the base module


[10-Oct-24 11:32 PM] jcheung#0000
you're still going to have some fractions going on


[10-Oct-24 11:33 PM] jcheung#0000
anyways, the framework i propose would be to simply guarantee that each "gate" is worth the same number of total shares


[10-Oct-24 11:34 PM] jcheung#0000
and proportional to each other


[10-Oct-24 11:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Non integer version:

[10-Oct-24 11:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
to go against the equal gates thing, think about this: 1 gate is created now, RDE cost is 35000. 1 gate is created in the future, RDE cost is now 50000


[10-Oct-24 11:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
the profits from both gates are equal


[10-Oct-24 11:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
the person who contributed that second RDE now must wait significantly longer to recoup their investment?


[10-Oct-24 11:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
or I suppose there could be toll inflation


[10-Oct-24 11:36 PM] jcheung#0000
so a gate built tomorrow and a gate built 6 months from now are roughly equal in return.
so a universe where in 6 months from now the prices have quadruplued doesn't mean with two gates built, the first gate is worth a quarter of the new gate


[10-Oct-24 11:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
it does mean the people that contributed to it should only get a quarter of the profits though


[10-Oct-24 11:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
imo


[10-Oct-24 11:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's kind of only a concern if RDE goes way up but the other items don't, for example. If the inflation is even, then they are still getting the same proportion of the shares they'd get before.


[10-Oct-24 11:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
well I'm also thinking about the tolls


[10-Oct-24 11:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
the tolls would have to go up with inflation


[10-Oct-24 11:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
like the inflation has to be accounted for somewhere


[10-Oct-24 11:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
either in % of shares or in tolls


[10-Oct-24 11:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
(tolls on old gates)


[10-Oct-24 11:38 PM] jcheung#0000
so am i. you can apply my framework to tolls as well. toll = base module + additional module + fuel cost


[10-Oct-24 11:38 PM] jcheung#0000
and then all the tolls across the universe change together


[10-Oct-24 11:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think that's fine to assume. Realistically tolls might have to change for non-inflation reasons too. One ofthe risks of entering the gateway coop is that your returns are unknown. They will be proportional to your contributions (as measured by material amount).


[10-Oct-24 11:38 PM] jcheung#0000
everything gets more expensive? all the tolls go up simultaneously


[10-Oct-24 11:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
The person who contributed 100 RDE today has "paid more" than the person who contributes 100 RDE in the future too, because of the "Time value of RDE" rule

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[10-Oct-24 11:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I think we'd need to encode that inflation into the tolls and I'm fine making them equal


[10-Oct-24 11:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
only trouble will be determining the initial values, because like I said, I don't have a BAd calculation including repair and workforce costs as BAd üòÖ


[10-Oct-24 11:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
BAd    77.35%
Consumption    22.66%


[10-Oct-24 11:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's what the numbers I showed are


[10-Oct-24 11:40 PM] jcheung#0000
could make each module a modifier and then every n months you check against the cost to build each component and that's your toll. some fraction of the cost.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10-Oct-24 11:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think if inflation of some goods is uneven, there will be a skew in future gateways, but that's not necessarily awful. Because there's a constant skew in profitability of different products, and I think generally people will accept that and eat the small difference. Usually it's still profitable, just a small relative shift


[10-Oct-24 11:41 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah makes sense


[10-Oct-24 11:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe we scale against anticipated traffic too?


[10-Oct-24 11:42 PM] jcheung#0000
also i would like to apologize for earlier, i fixated way too hard on decimals and fractional shares

{Reactions}
ü•∞ 

[10-Oct-24 11:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
I just don't want anyone getting scrwed


[10-Oct-24 11:42 PM] jcheung#0000
so like... if a gate only gets 10 trips a day it's cheaper than if it sees 160?


[10-Oct-24 11:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
and teeny tiny decimals have a tendency to do that without anyone knowing


[10-Oct-24 11:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
I like integers


[10-Oct-24 11:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
I round all my floats to integers if possible üòÑ


[10-Oct-24 11:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was thinking inverse, more trips = cheaper


[10-Oct-24 11:43 PM] jcheung#0000

[10-Oct-24 11:43 PM] hernanduer#0000

Google seems to suggest sheets uses 64bit floats.


[10-Oct-24 11:43 PM] jcheung#0000
hmm


[10-Oct-24 11:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's an interesting question: Do you price the gateway relative to the value it has to customers (like we price SAS software).. or do you price it based on what you think will generate a specific return in a target duration?


[10-Oct-24 11:44 PM] jcheung#0000
it could be argued that cheaper if lower traffic could drive more traffic, and taxing higher traffic areas more generates more revenue... but honestly i'm fine either way it goes


[10-Oct-24 11:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I guess it would have to include anticipated returns


[10-Oct-24 11:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Right... gotta draw the demand curve and find the maximum, which maximizes utility for everyone


[10-Oct-24 11:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
we'll all be underwriters by the end of this!


[10-Oct-24 11:45 PM] jcheung#0000
the other consideration with traffic is if it gets cheaper as more people use the lane, then.... more people will use the gate, and i'm worried about daily gate use saturation


[10-Oct-24 11:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
If we hit saturation, I will definitely raise the price. bam, problem solved üòÑ


[10-Oct-24 11:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
raise price and build a throughput upgrade to recoup it


[10-Oct-24 11:45 PM] jcheung#0000
whereas if it gets more expensive the more it's used, near max utilization it'll make people consider alternate routes


[10-Oct-24 11:46 PM] jcheung#0000
what if you're at max upgrades


[10-Oct-24 11:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
then you only raise price!


[10-Oct-24 11:46 PM] jcheung#0000
can't toss another upgrade, and you've made the fares cheaper because more people are using it


[10-Oct-24 11:46 PM] jcheung#0000
but then would this price increase be a special exception for one gate?


[10-Oct-24 11:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I figure the gates won't have equal prices anyway if we base it on distance upgrades


[10-Oct-24 11:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
some gates won't need all 3


[10-Oct-24 11:47 PM] jcheung#0000
if you do more traffic = more tolls, then this price increase would naturally occur


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] jcheung#0000
it also allows for self funding of upgrades (if the gate was allowed to keep a portion)


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
the opposite concern is


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
you plan a gateway, spend all these resources


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
and then turns out it's a dud


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] jcheung#0000
that's fine


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
and it's the cheapest gateway to use too, because no one uses it


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] jcheung#0000
you get payouts from all the other gates

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
but the few people that do, would pay anything to use that gate


[10-Oct-24 11:48 PM] jcheung#0000
the low traffic gates are subsidized by high traffic ones


[10-Oct-24 11:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
you miss capturing that potential money as well


[10-Oct-24 11:49 PM] jcheung#0000
you miss potential both ways. but you miss more by charging high usage more


[10-Oct-24 11:49 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, let me think of some more arbitrary numbers


[10-Oct-24 11:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
well you could argue if a path is high use, then it's more likely to stimulate growth


[10-Oct-24 11:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Really hard to know what the demand curve looks like. You can't really survey for it, you can experiment but we don't really have enough data points to fool around and figure it out.


[10-Oct-24 11:49 PM] jcheung#0000
let's go back to my 10 trips vs 160 trips


[10-Oct-24 11:49 PM] hernanduer#0000
keeping tolls low on a high use path will more likely increase that growth


[10-Oct-24 11:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
plus I think the ship pather is gonna do a lot of the work anyways


[10-Oct-24 11:50 PM] jcheung#0000
these gates, let's say they're exactly the same, same modules, same everything. hell, let's make them a paired gate and for some reason it sees a lot more one way traffic


[10-Oct-24 11:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
people suddenly hit with 30k tolls, haha


[10-Oct-24 11:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's a good reason to keep prices low until traffic increases (which it will because the price was low and people added bases). By the time they add a base they are locked in üòÑ


[10-Oct-24 11:51 PM] jcheung#0000
let's say that the base fare is 5k/trip, gate can handle 200 transits a period


[10-Oct-24 11:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe, but I figure the areas that are low travel are like that for a reason now


[10-Oct-24 11:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
so growth would be slower


[10-Oct-24 11:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
could be wrong


[10-Oct-24 11:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
If "Use Gateways" is on by default in the flight control, 90% of people will use them every time (probably?)

[10-Oct-24 11:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
since I assume that's what will be in the ledger


[10-Oct-24 11:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
I used PP30D_UNIVERSE for the prices there, not BAd, and the SPT/GWS/TRS/SST prices aren't derived with the same type of markup as PP30D commodities have


[10-Oct-24 11:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
The new gateway mats can't be stockpiled so if there was a.. like 10% bonus on them, I could see that being beneficial, since they will take more effort to make. - but I could be talked out of that


[10-Oct-24 11:55 PM] hernanduer#0000

ignore those BAd though, I think they're old ones


[11-Oct-24 12:00 AM] .shiva.#0000
you really don't need to worry about fractional shares. f64 epsilon is 1.11e-16, and you'll be multiplying that out w/ the payouts anyways


[11-Oct-24 12:01 AM] jcheung#0000
and if you do 0 traffic is 100% price increase, 50% traffic is 0, and 100% utilization is 10% discount

that would mean that those 10 users in the low traffic scenario would generate an income of roughly ~90k. heavily rounding.
high traffic, 160 per period, would generate roughly ~750k. also heavily rounded
total ~840k.

if we go the other way and apply 0 util = 50% discount, 50% util = base, 100% util = 10% surcharge,
low = ~30k
high = ~848k
total ~875k

at no discount 170 transits is 850k

more than enough precision, and if a single cred rounds away, it's w/e

[11-Oct-24 12:01 AM] jcheung#0000
now granted my numbers could be wrong


[11-Oct-24 12:02 AM] jcheung#0000
but income from taxing low traffic gates an insane amount doesn't offset even a moderate discount of high traffic


[11-Oct-24 12:06 AM] jcheung#0000
unless you think my example of +100% of base fare was too low for the low util gets charged more anyways.

[11-Oct-24 12:06 AM] jcheung#0000
if it was like +200% (15k @ 0) then i think that would offset


[11-Oct-24 12:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
If it turns a 1.5d journey into 2 hr.. then that cuts my shipping requirement (for that route) down by 15/16ths... which is a lot of 5m AIC ships saved. Which is probably a lot more than 15k per trip. I don't know if people will really think about it that way though.


[11-Oct-24 12:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Buying ships already has a long ROI, so people tend not to think about their true shipping costs.


[11-Oct-24 12:09 AM] hernanduer#0000
Okay but justify to the people building the gate, why do I pay for this low traffic gate when all it will do is dilute payouts to existing people and also will have the longest repayment period


[11-Oct-24 12:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
As a person building the high traffic gates I would be upset as well


[11-Oct-24 12:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hopefully the appeal includes the synergistic effect of having a better network. So a low traffic gate will pump up numbers for higher traffic gates, raising the whole pool.


[11-Oct-24 12:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
I intend to sell them that way, at least.


[11-Oct-24 12:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Plus you want to build it to prove Antaran Superiority


[11-Oct-24 12:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Just like Project 6115 üòâ


[11-Oct-24 12:12 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, but I get the feeling a lot of this is gonna fall on big players who have little to do (like you and I)


[11-Oct-24 12:12 AM] hernanduer#0000
So I want to understand reasonings üòÅ


[11-Oct-24 12:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah probably.

[11-Oct-24 12:13 AM] jcheung#0000
you can add a 0 and call base fare 50k


[11-Oct-24 12:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
Most of people like you and I have abilities to do these things, so I think it's fine.


[11-Oct-24 12:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, just a different way to think about it (also with made up numbers üòÑ )


[11-Oct-24 12:14 AM] jcheung#0000
because you wouldn't be the only one deciding it. the collective as a whole said "let's build this link"


[11-Oct-24 12:14 AM] jcheung#0000
also like i mentioned before a pair could see very high one way traffic for some weird reason


[11-Oct-24 12:15 AM] jcheung#0000
like say everyone wants to go clockwise in a circle instead of flowing both ways


[11-Oct-24 12:15 AM] jcheung#0000
then half of your ***paired gate*** would be the subsidized one


[11-Oct-24 12:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
Eh I don't bow down to collectives, it needs to make sense to me or else I just won't contribute, that's why I wanna talk it all out


[11-Oct-24 12:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think some people will only contribute to some gateways and not others


[11-Oct-24 12:16 AM] jcheung#0000
before you say "there's no way they would go in circles like that" i was thinking of a loop like h2o > farm > processing > cx > h2o. there's no reason to go the other way


[11-Oct-24 12:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
And they'd have concerns about share dilution


[11-Oct-24 12:17 AM] jcheung#0000
additionally, the higher fares at high throughput areas offsets the subsidies for the low throughput ones


[11-Oct-24 12:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
Ideally a share should always generate the same amount of money


[11-Oct-24 12:17 AM] jcheung#0000
well it won't, ever


[11-Oct-24 12:18 AM] jcheung#0000
a share will generate different amounts if on tuesday more people want to use the gate


[11-Oct-24 12:18 AM] jcheung#0000
and then on wednesday they all collectively decide their base is stocked for the next week


[11-Oct-24 12:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah of course, but by adding equal shares and unequal gateways, you're diluting older contributors unless they pay more


[11-Oct-24 12:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
To build the new gateway


[11-Oct-24 12:19 AM] jcheung#0000
no, because you get a portion of the new gate revenue


[11-Oct-24 12:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
Which is lower


[11-Oct-24 12:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
Because lower traffic


[11-Oct-24 12:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
Meanwhile the new contributors get some of the old gateway's tolls


[11-Oct-24 12:20 AM] jcheung#0000
unless you're adding cutthroat rates to the low traffic gates


[11-Oct-24 12:20 AM] jcheung#0000
you will not offset what you lose to giving high throughput gates a discount


[11-Oct-24 12:20 AM] jcheung#0000
and if you add cutthroat rates to a low traffic gate, only the desperate will use the gate, keeping throughput low


[11-Oct-24 12:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
Sure, but you see we have two problems here


[11-Oct-24 12:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think the solution for now should be that we target paths that have roughly equal revenue potential to gateway cost


[11-Oct-24 12:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
So there shouldn't be any 16:1 imbalances


[11-Oct-24 12:22 AM] jcheung#0000
there's the problem, the imbalance could be a linked pair seeing heavy one way traffic


[11-Oct-24 12:23 AM] jcheung#0000
without the other half of the pair you don't get any of the revenue from the link


[11-Oct-24 12:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
Hmm for that I wouldn't think so because the link doesn't exist without both


[11-Oct-24 12:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
Best to think of all gateways in pairs


[11-Oct-24 12:23 AM] jcheung#0000
sure, but utilization is per gate in one direction unless i misremembered something


[11-Oct-24 12:24 AM] jcheung#0000
unless to determine utilization you plan to sum both ends


[11-Oct-24 12:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
Perhaps all I'm saying is we should prioritize building a list of routes


[11-Oct-24 12:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
And work down the list by profit potential


[11-Oct-24 12:24 AM] jcheung#0000
sure, routes are one thing


[11-Oct-24 12:24 AM] jcheung#0000
fares are another


[11-Oct-24 12:24 AM] jcheung#0000
totally separate thing


[11-Oct-24 12:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
Ya I don't really care about the fares either way, was just giving an alternative


[11-Oct-24 12:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
Do think it's good to provide an idea of repayment period though


[11-Oct-24 12:27 AM] jcheung#0000
well, you suggested scaling tollsbased on traffic, you're on the side of high prices to low throughput links, discounts to high throughput. if high throughput maxes out, make pricing exception for fare increase.
i'm on the side of discount to low throughput to incentivize use, and surcharge for high throughput...


[11-Oct-24 12:28 AM] jcheung#0000
it's your suggestion ü§∑ if you want to drop it then fine


[11-Oct-24 12:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
I reworked the sheets a bit. I think the "Gateway Prices" tab needs more price information, then a "shares per material" can be calculated.

"Hey guys, do you think it would be possible to come up with a decision on which planet in A1 should have the first gate?

<RoH has entered the chat>

450 messages later.... üôÇ


First gate - my thoughts on the "viable choices"

I think it's between EoS, Heph, and Phobos.


Eos
On average closer to the CX. (But tbh, with orbital timings, it doesn't feel like a meaningful flight difference on average between EoS / Heph )

Lower population = Easier for a collective to gain control/ownership of a gate. Less likely to be able to use taxation as a funding method.

Electronics CoGC - So its easy for people to drop a permit on the planet and not feel like it's a wasted permit.


Heph
Still really close to the CX. 

High tier Manufacturing planet is kinda nice for a number of the final steps needed in the construction process. Could be a good choice if you feel like there's a race to build one first.

Manufacturing planet is maybe less suitable as a place for lots of people to just "drop a permit" for control because it could be easy to outproduce demand.

High existing pop might make control harder.


Phobos
Noticeably further from the CX so, that adds needless hours of travel in the long term.

Electronics CoGC good for previously mentioned reasons.

If some degree of funding from the tax base is required, it's probably the best planet for that.

High existing pop might make control harder.

____

Assuming the donation/cap table method of funding is locked in as the method of funding, I think EoS is the best choice. I feel like long term control/ownership is one of the hardest hurdles to overcome, and the lower existing pop of EoS is an advantage in that respect.


[11-Oct-24 12:44 AM] jcheung#0000
another plus for hep. has a shipyard and high level WAR


[11-Oct-24 12:44 AM] jcheung#0000
iirc you can repair at shipyards? unless i've lost my rocker.


[11-Oct-24 12:44 AM] jcheung#0000
so people coming out of the gate could immediately start repairs


[11-Oct-24 12:45 AM] jcheung#0000
and the high level WAR allows for a ship to offload and turn around rapidly


[11-Oct-24 12:46 AM] jcheung#0000
...though idk if it's faster to land or go to ANT


[11-Oct-24 12:47 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I never really thought about warehouses - I think that's a great point.


[11-Oct-24 01:02 AM] evov#0000
But I also think warehouse count seems like a fairly easy problem to overcome if that's the deciding factor.


[11-Oct-24 01:05 AM] realharvey#0000
I do understand your suggestion of a smaller planet that would be easier to take "control" of the goverment. But with that I'd also be vulnerble to hostile takeovers.


[11-Oct-24 01:08 AM] evov#0000
On a large planet, the "hostile takeover" people already have bases built. Small ones - they have to actually drop permits to get numbers.


[11-Oct-24 01:16 AM] realharvey#0000
There are very good suggestions and thoughts coming in this channel. But what I feel like all of this is lacking is strong leadership. Someone that directs all that input and makes sure we get to decisions.

Archiel has started this Initiative, but as far as I can tell he doesn't want to lead it necessarily? 

So in my opinion what we first need to decide on how we want to organise "leadership" of this project. A group of people always needs some folks that make the final call that people can agree on. 

What form of leadship is suggest is what we run at work. I call it *"democratic dictatorship" * - Which is nothing other than: 90% the group decides as a unit what is best and 10% leadership has to make a call because discussions lead to nowhere. Leadership also keeps discussions more structured and focussed on one topic. Because this is a game and everyones time is limited, I'd suggest we need a group of 3 people. (Preferably with different timezones aswell)

In Antares there are 3 Mayor player groups: OOG, ADI and AA.
With these groups aligned we should be able to get control over any planet that we need. Therefore I suggest that the leadership(group) should be made up of people that have roots/connections to all those to get stuff moving.


[11-Oct-24 01:41 AM] .shiva.#0000
you can repair anywhere other than a CX I'm pretty sure?

[11-Oct-24 01:53 AM] jcheung#0000
sounds like you need a base or a shipyard


[11-Oct-24 01:53 AM] jcheung#0000
so you can't repair somewhere you don't have a base.... or a shipyard


[11-Oct-24 02:03 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôll build a shipyard on Halcyon üòä


[11-Oct-24 02:47 AM] realharvey#0000
@archielvahr I'd like to get your opinion on this since you started the Idea of the Cooperative


[11-Oct-24 07:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm happy to take the leadership role. When I started the thread I knew we had a ton of time before the feature would actually launch, so I wanted to spend that time bringing people into the project so they had plenty of time to share their views and become real contributors to the planning. 

I haven't put my foot down about anything reallllly (especially route stuff) since we have lots of time and I don't want to alienate anyone by rushing to set things in stone. 

I have spoken with Rise and have him on board with the coop model. he indicated he probably won't be contributing directly, but is willing to help facilitate administration. So any planet he governs would be a fine candidate.


[11-Oct-24 07:18 AM] realharvey#0000
Very good. I was planning to get rise on board aswell once we figure out what leadership will look like.


[11-Oct-24 07:19 AM] realharvey#0000
If you need any help. I'll be happy to join in aswell.

[11-Oct-24 12:46 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hah! Good one. 

But issues of control easily turn into the demands of voting blocks, since everyone in-game gets only 1 ADM vote, every 28 days. When the base count on a planet is small, you get fairly open windows for any political attack, with minimum effort. 

When those counts are rather high, you're looking at a windows for corporations, or associations, to do their work. It's fairly easily to establish a form of private consensus with the latter, since all you really need to do is just drop a "Hey-all. This is my position for this place, regarding our group interests in the long-term; I'd appreciate if you would vote for my recommendation(s)... like ASAP".  Anything in-between is likely a mix of both.

Given my previous "base drop samples" on Verdant, you'll be getting like 10-15% of the bases, on any planet to actually vote every 28 days. This correlates very strongly with the likely BASIC/PRO player densities on those worlds, which does indicate, at least for me, that the only people who do vote have some sort of private interest, which is generally unspoken in public. 

Since us peeps are not only in ADI, but also in AA or OOG... the only people really able to be involved in private associations are BASIC/PROs anyways, this lends strong credence to the idea that we'll be able to pull through the votes that we need, pretty much most of the time, in ANT space....

But regarding outer-rim stuff, like LS-231, we'd need to make up some business plans for people to go out there, drop a base, and make something profitably... Going even further down the line, to say like UV-351 Katoa, or XH-594 Libertas/Kiruna/Cortez? Good luck, since I don't think we'll have enough player densities over in those parts to make a dent. Thus a form of diplomacy would be advised for those trailing-ends of a gateway route.


[11-Oct-24 01:12 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm also getting rather concerned, regarding potential VF fuel requirements. 

The bottlenecks regarding VF, lies within the EEP BUIs, which require ENGs+SCI. Getting hold of a LES base is rather trivial. Per 500 area bases, the VF fuel bottleneck follows something along the lines of this ratio:   1 COL (LES) : 1 EEP (ES) : 5 EEP (KRE) : 1 REF (VF).

I think my estimates of max fuel production for that VR | REF, is 83,200 units daily. If Gateway fuel usage is anything like FF fuel rates (Parsec range * 2.115 == ~MIN FF requirements), then we might have another set of issues to deal with....

The Gateway capacity upgrades also have their own issue. While on face value, you have a Fuel Capacity : Flights Permitted ratio of 25/8, this drops to 25/12 when you do more Capacity upgrades on a gateway. With more capacity upgrades, you'll get potentially more actual trips, with the larger fuel bays... But should those capacity requirements go beyond a certain point, and the gate will stop to function until re-fueled. This would point to having some sort of stand-by ships, ready and able to refuel those things, with a full load of VF?


[11-Oct-24 01:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
we don't know the burn rate of VF to jumps


[11-Oct-24 01:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
so I wouldn't put too much thought into that side yet


[11-Oct-24 02:03 PM] realbandit#0000
We do have data on the fuel capacity of gates, starting at 625, presumably units, but it could be in t or m^3 in which case it's 6250.
Unless they intend for gateways to have to be refuelled several times per day, each trip can only consume between 2.5-25 VF based on the numbers per upgrade for jumps and fuel.
Based on that you only need either 1/6th of a REF, or 1.5 REF per gateway - and thats at 100% efficiency.
You also only need 1.55x more EEP than REF.

{Reactions}
üòÆ 

[11-Oct-24 02:14 PM] jcheung#0000
I would ASSume that it would be closer to 6250 stored


[11-Oct-24 02:17 PM] realbandit#0000
Yeah, 6250 would make more sense
We estimate VF to be about the same price as SF/FF, maybe a bit cheaper, so a 300M gateway only needing 10k of fuel per day seems low. Though 100k per day seems low too.


[11-Oct-24 02:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Keeping it fueled might be intended to be a mechanic more like "Hey does someone sorta pay attention to this every once in a while?" rather than "Someone has to devote serious effort and shipping to keep it fueled"


[11-Oct-24 02:20 PM] realbandit#0000
So, more like POPI, and less like someone with 35 RIGs on Basic with 5 queue slots?


[11-Oct-24 02:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Exactly


[11-Oct-24 02:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Or filling a COGC- it never breaks anyone's bank, you just gotta remember to do it.


[11-Oct-24 02:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
COGC is like 1% of the costs of Malahat


[11-Oct-24 02:25 PM] realbandit#0000
Though only Gov can supply VF right?
At least with CoGC anyone on planet can fill it if it runs out


[11-Oct-24 02:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Probably any MP, hopefully it doesn't take a motion


[11-Oct-24 02:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I don't know what it will look like, because we don't have anything only a governor or MP can fill, and I feel like they don't want to make something new for this üòõ


[11-Oct-24 03:12 PM] jvaler#0000
so what's the deal with this whole share thing? are gateways actually going to generate enough profit to warrant that?


[11-Oct-24 03:14 PM] jcheung#0000
The real question is, is this a for profit endeavor, or public service infrastructure


[11-Oct-24 03:14 PM] jcheung#0000
Because that determines how much profit there is üòÇ


[11-Oct-24 04:04 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't see why contributors shouldn't be rewarded for their efforts


[11-Oct-24 04:04 PM] jvaler#0000
and that'd be done by some kind of taxes on the gateway, right? which would be player set?


[11-Oct-24 04:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's how the share thing works, basically.


[11-Oct-24 04:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Contributors should be rewarded by the tolls collected


[11-Oct-24 04:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
So if you put up 50% of the stuff for the gateways, you get 50% of the shares, then you get 50% of the tolls


[11-Oct-24 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Don't really know how much it adds up to but I think it's important to have a fair plan in place regardless.


[11-Oct-24 04:42 PM] jcheung#0000
right, my question was more "do we aim for a cheap ticket price and go for a longer ROI, or try to make the ROI as short as possible"


[11-Oct-24 04:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
you can't have expansive tickets or people just not gonna use it


[11-Oct-24 05:00 PM] jvaler#0000
fair enough. not enough information i guess


[11-Oct-24 05:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
VF looks like half the BAd but twice the consumption cost

so probably something like 20-25/u wouldn't be outlandish (.039 BAd and 8.67 consumption cost/u)


[11-Oct-24 05:58 PM] realbandit#0000
Interesting, I think our prices might be more biased towards area than you guys then.
But overall it's the same ballpark as SF/FF - which makes the dev's apparent choice of usage rate strange in terms of scale.

[11-Oct-24 06:02 PM] realbandit#0000
I think most recipes are fine, and even that could be a way of just creating variance (via tiers, building, or location) so i don't mind that, but what bothers me is inconsistency, like the W recipe and the VF usage rate.
Implies they don't have an accurate reading of the universe and how the players are operating.

It's hard to argue with anyone, who puts up their money for a vanity product.


[12-Oct-24 05:00 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I chatted about this in the ADI thread that we have used before.

There's basically a price ceiling for potential toll fares. You've got the SF + FF + Depreciation costs for any FTL ship doing an ANT <--> BEN (or anything for that matter) trip [Average cost estimate].

The gateways will have their own "fixed" Average cost estimates for SF + Depreciation on the client-side. On the operator side will be the "fixed" VF usages [Sum of VF usage across all gateways for said trip].

Subtracting those two figures from each other will give you a potential max toll that can be applied over the route from the gateways. 

If the tolls fares are then equal with the price ceiling estimates for FTL travel, you have a 50:50 shot that people will take the gateways, over just spooling their FTLs on the route, for any given instance of travel. 

If it's marginally less than it, I'm sure that people will do their contract calculations, and prefer to proc gateway use, rather than incur marginally more shipping costs from not using it. 

```Price_Ceiling || SF_ftl + FF_ftl + Depreciation_ftl

Gateway_Fixed || SF_gate + Depreciation_gate + VF_gate

Price_Ceiling - Gateway_Fixed == Toll_Ceiling || Toll_Ceiling / Gateway_transits == Max Toll on each gateway within the route```


[12-Oct-24 05:09 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Pricing tolls for FTL traffic, since one field of thought wants to include them, to increase potential weekly revenues, has it's own negative feedback system built into it.... Not by outright design, but by player habit... 

If you have shitty shipping contract offers all over the place, and people are arbitraging the s*** out of the intra-day trade at each CX, now you're basically shoving any FTL shipper into a rat-race, towards the bottom of profit margins, and expense considerations will be a foremost concern for them, being the customer. 

The other field of thought is pricing tolls for STL traffic. There's basically no price ceiling for tolls on them, since they're paying for a premium benefit of having their STL ships, be able to do FTL runs. Rather, there's a price floor, with the aforementioned "fixed" operating costs on the FTL side (minus the FF of course).


[12-Oct-24 05:14 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Devs will just run another instance of whatever noise generator that they used to build the current universe, just for KR, and then paste those results over the current instance.. You might have a few new planets, or you might have some current planets with the surprise benefit of cheap and abundant KR, when the release is had.... It'll be a random shot though. Pray to R.N.Gesus for the best results.


[12-Oct-24 05:26 AM] evov#0000
r.e. Price Ceiling on STL traffic -   Gateway fee's will be competing against the cost to upgrade their STL ship to an FTL ship, or to just buy an FTL ship.

I also think it's a mistake to ignore the benefits of faster travel times. It will have differing value to different people, but just because it's hard to quantify, doesn't mean it's not a factor when making price comparisons between Gateway trips vs existing FTL trips.


[12-Oct-24 05:34 AM] evov#0000
I tend to agree that a lot of the CX-CX trade that happens IS, and will continue to be, a rat race to the bottom. At this stage, I don't believe it will be possible for Gateways to be cheaper per unit to transport goods CX-CX than existing shipping. Most of their viability at this stage will boil down to the time savings ( which we don't really know enough about yet )


[12-Oct-24 05:34 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah there's that... But are you really going to upgrade your Gateway STLs, into FTLs... If we set our toll math properly, we'd be forcing people to abide by the metrics we set, since then you can either use the gateways as is, or invest liquidity that you won't get back, for an FTL ship that you don't need.


[12-Oct-24 05:35 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@molp please, patch in some established gateways, within range of each other, so that we can fiddle around, on the test server xD


[12-Oct-24 05:37 AM] evov#0000
I think a Gateway STL ship is a very specific and Niche option. And I simply wouldn't make one unless the transit costs were low enough. So, gateway pricing would need to be low enough for that to be an attractive option - hence the Ceiling on FTL ship travel prices being dependent on the cost difference between building an STL ship vs FTL ship.


[12-Oct-24 05:38 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, but it's what is it.... an "early adopter" thing... Once the greater market of established gateway networks get set around the place, you'll be entering market maturity, and STL viability will be much more, than what we're seeing for the first few months after the release date.


[12-Oct-24 06:04 AM] evov#0000
Sure, STL ships will be more viable after gateways. But they're at like.. 6.5% of the ship production at the moment. So it would seem kind of . . . . odd... to be using the experience of STL ship operators as a guide for pricing, unless you think we'll be able to charge ships different prices for using a gate depending on if they have an FTL engine or not.


[12-Oct-24 06:09 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, I don't think so either... It is however something to potentially bring up on the forums, to help "guide" the devs thinking. Idk how effective such things would be though.

Having a sort of "stats" on the gateway buffer, regarding traffic flows, would be a nice addition. Without variable pricing methods, we're looking at that FTL price ceiling that I mentioned first, since it's the most tangible metric that we could use on release, without any further changes to what the devs have told us that they intend.


[12-Oct-24 08:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm still of the mind they'll add a 5k ship at some point


[12-Oct-24 08:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
Which they may make STL only or the FTL will just be so slow or something


[12-Oct-24 01:06 PM] jcheung#0000
no. it's not just about fuel cost, but also time cost. at the same cost, the odds of gate usage will be significantly higher than FTL travel


[12-Oct-24 06:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Is the Colossus of Rhodes a good meme for ADI's Gateway Cooperative? Idk.
```
In the late fourth century BC, Rhodes, allied with Ptolemy I of Egypt, prevented a mass invasion staged by their common enemy, Antigonus I Monophthalmus.

In 304 BC a relief force of ships sent by Ptolemy arrived, and Demetrius (son of Antigonus) and his army abandoned the siege, leaving behind most of their siege equipment. To celebrate their victory, the Rhodians sold the equipment left behind for 300 talents and decided to use the money to build a colossal statue of their patron god, Helios.
```
```
According to wage rates from 377 BC, a talent was the value of nine man-years of skilled work. This corresponds to 2340 work days or 11.1 grams (0.36 ozt) of silver per worker per workday. 
```
Geez, 300 peeps devoting 9 years each of their labour, for a common cause. It sure seems appropriate. I'm just being silly. üòõ

Hmm, a rather good opportunity for a tangent....

The most of what we earn, is either some cheaply printed paper notes of credit, inked with some communal belief in its worth at most, or some electronic entry in some private enterprise's database. Neither of which I can do some metal-work on, and produce something with a value-added margin. Food for thought?

... Ping me on an #office or #communal-area channel in here, for some proper discourse. Else I'm leaving this as-is, for more room for some new AGC ideas.


[14-Oct-24 04:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am open to proposed prices for gateway materials for the purposes of calculating contribution shares. These could be either CX based or Base-area-day based (or a mix).

[14-Oct-24 11:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
just to reiterate mine here, as far as proportional representation, I think these make the most sense


[14-Oct-24 11:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
they're tied to the ratio of BAd to consumption cost that SEA generates


[14-Oct-24 11:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
so SEA costs .548 BAd to make 1, and also costs 27.186 AIC in workforce mats and repair cost


[14-Oct-24 11:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
the sale price of SEA is 120


[14-Oct-24 11:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
so that gives a ratio of BAd importance as 77%, and the consumption cost as 23% (exact number in pic). It does this by simple (120 - 27.186)/120 for BAd and 27.186/120 for consumption


[14-Oct-24 11:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
it then applies that 77/23 split to all the other mats

Perhaps it's a cheaper way to get "funnelled" one-way gateway traffic, or it's an in-road to political strife.


[15-Oct-24 06:12 AM] evov#0000
I don't believe so. I think you're just misunderstanding.
I think this post lines up with existing plans/assumptions.

Many gates can "point" towards a single gate. But a link is only formed when both gates point at each other.

The ui Moip's working on/showing off there is showing the ( These are the gates "trying" to link with you, who do you want to link with ) scenario.

The "Link Status" line might be a hint.


[15-Oct-24 06:20 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmm, yeah that makes sense. Will it be causing confusion with those who are unfamiliar with the development plans? Likely. Incoming/Outgoing have very hard logical consequents... Whereas the development plan is just using those terms as a baseline for any "potential" incoming links, verified through GOV motion, and one hard-set 1:1 link parity via an outgoing connection.

[18-Oct-24 01:23 AM] evov#0000
From my numbers ( allowing for a production rate of 1 gateway per 100 days )  -  Less than half a CLF and half an AAF would be needed to meet those targets ( most of which can't be produced until after the new recipes are in the game ). So I think I'll look to modify an existing Manufacturing base closer to the time they're made available.


[18-Oct-24 01:45 AM] realbandit#0000
Our numbers show about 136 AAF days per Gateway, so counting it at 160.5% efficiency it's closer to 85% of an AAF to reach a gateway every 100 days.
But on that note, remember that the GWS has to be made on planet, and would be made last, so that could stall the overall construction somewhat.


[18-Oct-24 01:50 AM] realbandit#0000
I'm couting 5 GWS total, 4 GWS for the initial build and 1 for the Volume, which I think explains the difference.


[18-Oct-24 01:54 AM] evov#0000
It's more likely I've entered a number wrong somewhere from the new recipes tbh since I did most of my workings late one night haha. I think for AAF's - its 5 GWS / 6 SST and 6 PFG  ( for the typical gateway +1 volume+3 range). It still feels like it's in the... 1-2 buildings required region, which i'm not worried about as much as some of the other parts.


[18-Oct-24 01:59 AM] realbandit#0000
Actually I might have been using 7 GWS - from a calculation assuming we wanted 3km^3 ships to fit through.
If we just go for the 1 volume to fit 2k/2k's it's 5 GWS, and about 0.6 AAF's to get a gateway every 100 days.


[18-Oct-24 02:00 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I saw an error I had as well - moves it up to closer to 100% usage of a single AAF to meet that timeline. Still doesn't feel like a major problem with respect to timelines or productive capacity.

CBL/LIT/SP I'm producing now. PSH/RSH - in the middle of setting up productive capacity - probably wont "flick the switch" until I know if they'll actually be needed or not. TSH is the next on my list to get sorted.


[18-Oct-24 03:28 AM] realbandit#0000
I've gone over the SPT to check now, and @archielvahr I think you may be right - the SPT per gateway is actually 5,200, or 16.25d worth at 160.5% efficiency. So you would need multiple CLF's.
But more importantly, it seems both the ADI sheet and SNF's own has a Gateway needing 2000 SPT, but this screenshot from the test server shows it only takes 200 for the actual gateway (and 1k per GWS). Where did we mix this up?

Mmm... A happy mistake? Not ours either. I triple checked figures when I dug into the test server gateway stuff, and then dug some more to pull out all the material reqs for the options, which was a while back now.

If they actually updated that SPT figure for the base gateways, someone just added an extra 0 in the code base, and only caught that mistake now.

PSH honestly isn‚Äôt too bad. LIT will take more effort


[19-Oct-24 04:16 AM] evov#0000
Most of the gateway mats I produce will likely just go to the CX for the moment.
I've started a project to see if I can fund a gateway with planet taxation. I suspect it's going to take quite a while to make that happen and there's no real benefit to having the mats sitting in a warehouse while various other groups are starting to build.


[19-Oct-24 07:55 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmm. You probably can get a decent revenue stream, from a planet... You'll need something at least of 100 bases there, to get something decent. I can't give you estimates, since I'm working on a general sheet, for similar things, that I'll likely incorporate into a #jailbreak version of Archiel's GOV sheet. 

But that sort of revenue stream will be involuntary, compared to what we might be doing. You're also going through a set of market inefficiencies there -- converting liquidity, into commodities on the CX, which have their own profit margins attached to the units available.


[19-Oct-24 07:57 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The other groups are also in the same situation that we are. No gateway tech to install right now. So everyone either waits and builds up stock; or doesn't wait, makes more money doing their usual thing, and then re-tools without an immediate stock.


[19-Oct-24 09:15 AM] evov#0000
Yea, 1 planet didn't seem like it would cut it, so I've set up 5 planets in a system for the purpose so far.

Given the sheer number of gateways needed to complete a CX loop, I'd rather work towards something that has a chance of funding re-curing future gates rather than something that's donation based.

Even if the funding via taxes fails miserably, at least the ANT region will have gained a useful industrial hub and I'll just build a few gates myself if/when private ownership becomes a thing.


[19-Oct-24 09:28 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
hmmm. You could try out voluntary WAR rentals (very high WAR fees --- people don't have to rent em, since we have STOs)... Higher LM fees will also work. A good base establishment fee as well..... Ah you're already doing triple duty on the BE fees, over at IA-151.


[19-Oct-24 05:13 PM] evov#0000
Nope. WAR rentals and LM fee's will be kept as low as possible. The whole point of developing a system with ( Construction + Electronics + Manufacturing + Chem + Metallurgy ) CoGC's in the same system is to make it easier for collaboration and cross industry trade. Cheap and accessible LM's and Warehouses help facilitate that.


[20-Oct-24 10:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
In accordance with this poll, let's discuss locking in Heph <-> LS-231 as the first set of ADI gates in ANT.  https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1293249484418977852/1293955192022241392

[24-Oct-24 12:56 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
These results will be cross-checked for:

- First for ADI Gateway contribution concurrence...

- Second for ADI activity concurrence...

#Voting blocks have been mentioned as a serious concern for investment retention, through these many weeks, I'm just following through. I'll collect the details, per vote, and drop them in the ADI sheet. The vote period is just for 7 days. Most of you should see the post. üôÇ

There will likely be deficiencies regarding LS-231.... We might have to pour more funds just for HQ upgrades + ships, just to spin up additional bases in that system. This is purely by the numbers. The devs truly gave us a fuzz-ball, with gateway mechanics linked with GOV mechanics..

Census
A census (from Latin censere, 'to assess') is the procedure of systematically acquiring, recording, and calculating population information about the members of a given population, usually displayed in the form of statistics. This term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include census...

However... Seeing how the chatter here is developing... Some weight should be given with each person's pledge of #contribution (currency or materials), to the project --- with their opinion....

**Keep it #real, or keep it #fake.**

We're talking about serious figures, **without any** structured-loan program, or guarantees with in-game programming. Any 10^6 figure donation (1,000,000 AIC) will directly detriment the expansion rates for anyone donating. You need more FTL ships, or more A-fab HQ permits for personal stuff? Well too-bad, since we need your donations!


We should have something like 6 months of time to discuss any issues at hand... Even if they're marginal issues...


[24-Oct-24 07:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Current pledges are like what? 8 users out of 185 total #agc-general members? That yields a ratio of 8:185 directly, which is not even 5% of our overall ADI population here in this chat.

Lets hammer out whatever issues we have, into a flat-sheet of common interests, that we all agree upon, and can contribute material/finances for. **We've got 6 months for this**.. This is literally a #hostile-negotiation. 

I'm trying to be nice... And I'm giving a lot of lee-way for project cords to steer this project, with what they would like..

you can still count the members list, that's not an admin-only thing. that's how you got your 185 number to begin with anyways...?

You have at most, per current ADI sheet uptake... 8 people who are contributing... Versus the overall population figures that you've all included in this conversation... this ain't a debate, per **my** standards.

I'd like more contributions, from anyone...... ~ 185 from Discord drop-downs? 

1 Project Admin + 4 Server Boosters + 4 Co-ords + 46 Project Members + 5 Project Associates + 2 Online Peeps + 124 Offline Peeps......

--> 186 people who have access to this channel, who can contribute, who can offer opinions via anything related, offer dissensions, et.c.     .... (**we have 6+ months per usual dev patches btw**)...

If you wants to volunteer bases for fixed cost consumables, then it can be discussed...? But the way i see it, the focus should be gateways not things 15 items down the production chain which may or may not affect the final output price


[24-Oct-24 09:53 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Same. 

I'll give like 10-20 minutes in here each day.. So that we're all on the same page.. (I've mentioned before, regarding the 'dev imposed fuzz-ball... yeah it's exactly that).. At the extremes of "my language", most of y'all are not on the same page as me, so let me try to correct this, since we have time, and since most ppl's life experiences aren't the same as mine.

1) In a "hostile" negotiation, all parties to such thing, advocate for their best interest... So MOR people advocate for Mor stuff.... ANT people advocate for Ant stuff. HRT and BEN people advocate for their own interests, and the like... The best outcome for this, is for everyone to meet each other "in-the-middle", so that something is agree'd upon and taken action there upon, from such....

2) In a "pacifist" negotiation, all parties to such a thing, advocate not for their best interest, but for whatever interest seems to be the "best" option... Socially, politically, financially...... The best outcome for this, is for most "people", to agree upon some standard. **This need not be some communal benefit.** Some can, and usually do benefit more, than others, in this style. 

#1 Is pure maths..... 

#2 Is when you want to follow a given political coalition, when you really haven't made up your own mind....


[24-Oct-24 10:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
I wonder what's the income from all ANT planets (excluding expanses for COGC/POPI). This whole project is a financial suicide... There are barely any people who would benefit from gates for the price they cost. If anyone would want to finance this it should be taxes from ANT planets + IDC charity


[24-Oct-24 10:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^^^^ Yes, option #3... Just go end yourself? Right... Dev metrics are ill- based, illogical, and will have most people quitting in 6+ months if they choose such......


[24-Oct-24 10:14 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
More commentary tomorrow... Dev's logic is not as straight-forward as most #immediate-return focused player objectives are. Devs are looking towards long-term outcomes. Most Governors, on all your favorite planets, have long since quit
 before your own terms.. The game will outlast your company's instance... This is a long-term trend... Even my own 2 years in game? -- Yeah I've seen at most, x4 GOVs, with their own corps, basically burn out, within 2 years, on each popular planet..........


[24-Oct-24 10:17 PM] jcheung#0000
> This need not be some communal benefit.
the goal of this to my understanding is to bolster the development of the antares community....


[24-Oct-24 10:18 PM] tanda#0000

[24-Oct-24 10:18 PM] tanda#0000
so they've cooked up a 3+ year public works project


[24-Oct-24 10:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
So my suggestion to pick a "Collector" a person who will manage the spreadsheet of contributions (AIC/items). They will hold all of the materials themselves. We can make a vote who that person should be (you gotta be always online, be a long term player and be in a good relationship with people here and any other old players from other factions). People how donated AIC/items could have a special role on this server if they donate 10mil/50mil/100mil+. For other stuff "Collector" would aquare taxes from ANT planets to purchase items through contracts or CX


[24-Oct-24 10:19 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yep.... Just notes from me... All your current GOVs, on the popular planets, basically walked into fully developed SST x10, INFx 10, PAR x10, and WAR x20 starter planets.......

> This whole project is a financial suicide...
afaik we're not going door to door and holding a knife to people's throats and saying "donate or else"

I agree with the direction of this sentiment. So I started work on a project in that direction a few weeks ago.

While I hope that the donation based charity effort being championed here works.... more gates is more better... I feel like it's worth perusing an alternative path forward. Same goal - To develop the greater Antares region, with gateways playing a role in the  long term benefit/advantage of the region. Just a different path of working towards that goal.


[25-Oct-24 12:18 AM] pi3142718#0000
Not all quit. Many are still around in some capacity, but it‚Äôs clear that managing a government was more of a hassle than it was worth. Hopefully that‚Äôs a little better now with parliaments, but it‚Äôs still not completely balanced


[25-Oct-24 12:18 AM] pi3142718#0000
With the responsibility in theory spread out between 5 people


[25-Oct-24 12:20 AM] pi3142718#0000
What‚Äôs your alternative approach?

Start up a group of planets in/near a good gateway location. Put higher than usual tax rates on the planets, and aim to fund a gateway with tax revenue (pooled together from the collection of planets)


[25-Oct-24 12:25 AM] evov#0000
I've spent about 30mil in the last couple weeks building up a group of 5 planets (plus the cost of my own permits/bases etc ). And dedicated another 30mil worth of ships to it, so it has logistical support available if people need it.


[25-Oct-24 07:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
Is that "front the money for the gateway, because it will spur development of those planet afterward?" or "entice people to join the planets because there will later be a gateway there?"


[25-Oct-24 07:33 AM] evov#0000
Fundamentally, it's just an attempt at closing the loop on the funding/control concerns I have that we've talked about previously. 

Getting the gateway/s paid for by the people on the planet (or collection of planets), controlled/owned collectively by all the people on those planets (not by small % of the population of the planet being contributors/owners), and the primary beneficiary's of the gateway would be . . . . the people with bases on those planets.  

It's not a solution that works for all possible gateway locations. For example the CX based Gates will be on existing high pop planets would probably not work very well for this system. But when we're looking at wanting a network of 16+ gates .... I feel like having a variety of funding/building options can only be a benefit.


[26-Oct-24 07:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Planetary development is mostly a strategy based thing. There's a reason that pretty much all Triple-Green planets within any CX vicinity have been taken, for one purpose or another. There is a general ~60-70% COGC matching rates regarding bases on the more filled worlds, but that's just up to bunch of considerations, which are player determined, yet they're usually aligned with greater-Prun consensus regarding whats the best thing to do here?!

 Lower up-front capital investment requirements -- with enough time and player interest, any place can be started to run towards a particular COGC objective. And with more player base densities on a given planet, the more of a tax revenue volume that can be applied to other things.

Regarding only PRO licensees, the lower tiered bunch of them are usually triple-permitting, or saving their permits for future applications, due to the ever constant shipping crunch. Since Deimos has been maxed out for PROs who haven't gotten a base there already, and Harmonia will be coming soon.... Players may start to look in other directions for expansion potential.


[26-Oct-24 08:08 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Fundamentally, it's entirely about the player counts within ANT space, if we'd like to start laundering some tax revenues to help keep these gateway projects afloat. Mo' Players = Mo' Bases = Mo' Profits. 

You might think that the numbers we've construed regarding gateway costs might be exceedingly high and unsustainable, as largely only like what, 5 people have pledged materials so far... But those individual pledges amount to only about ~1 month of post-sale operating profits, if you're just starting out on the A-fab HQ upgrade progression. Get a few more contributors, and tag a few more months of profits to gateway contributions, and you'll easily have a projection of how many gateway routes can be installed, every year.


[26-Oct-24 08:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If someone can volunteer some in-game time, I'll need a few decently sized planets worth of production aggregates, to start issuing my tax base projections for planets. That info could help with Evov's stuff, or other places as well. 

But most of this stuff is just a few intertwined process flows of player activity:

- Player operations cycling through opportunity costs between whatever to produce, where at, yielding weekly profit figures.
- Planetary tax bases, yielding ever growing discretionary funding, to use for whatever, after POPR/POPI is up-kept
- Discretionary spending, regarding HQ permit upgrades, and new ship purchases, which fund many other non-essential player bases, tendering a second set of ~quarterly profit figures.
- And by mid-summer '25, you'll have another set of revenue figures from the gateways, whose new mechanics will also feed into the aforementioned discretionary spending, per more ships, and bases.

[26-Oct-24 09:59 AM] evov#0000
"That info could help with Evov's stuff"   - Nah, I'm good thanks.

At the moment, population growth on the planets is the limiting factor. So I'd be interested in tips on fast pop growth from Archiel or Rise, or other experienced govs of note. Not much point in bringing more players onto the planets without the pop available for them. For anyone interested in the future, IA-151 is the system in question with a few nearby points of interest highlighted on the map.

It's a chicken, or the egg, sort of thing.. Player bases need POPR, but POPRs cannot sustain themselves without base drops, which cut down on unemployment rates, keep your happiness levels high, cut down on the need for higher tier upkeep, and provide a tax base.

**It's more of a marketing issue.... Since you've got COGC programs running, people will eventually notice the listings on Prunplanner/FIO, and they'll run their numbers to see if your planets are good enough for their needs....** I'd cut the Base Establishment fees to like 2-3mil, and go really heavy on the WAR/LR fees rates though. A 10mil Base Establishment fee basically advertises to other peeps that these planets are for "my personal use".

PIO--> TEC POPRs don't need significant unemployment pools. Any short term issues can be fixed with an immigration program. ENG/SCIs usually get constant growth through the inherent education rates, but without significant TEC employment figures, the weekly turnover rate is tiny, so immigration programs for them will be needed, once there is a need.


[26-Oct-24 05:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Peeked at the planets, they look on target. Running all the right programs


[26-Oct-24 05:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can cheese them up a bit more with comfort and culture, even if it's just low tech workers, they still appreciate it. It's a very aggressive choice to do that though.


[26-Oct-24 05:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
And unemployment will be a driver of unhappiness when pops are very small, so something to keep in mind. Paying for bases from other players can be the cheapest way to deal with that.


[26-Oct-24 05:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
IA-151D will need to get all those engineers from eng immigration eventually.


[26-Oct-24 05:53 PM] evov#0000
Yea, got them all set up like this. Some of them aren't showing yet due to being in the first week. I've got a couple of people currently waiting on pop growth / my immigration programs to work through before they put bases down.

The huge focus, for quite some time, was on Deimos, since it was so nice... Now the planet is filled, and people are looking at other choices.


[26-Oct-24 08:48 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Since ALO/AL is mostly dependent on resource densities on whatever planet its to be found on.... New arrivals to ANT will now look towards Nascent, as an off-COGC AL base, or elsewhere if they're lucky. That fits my definition of an "exodus".


[26-Oct-24 08:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Both of us got on Deimos, before the plot creep set in, so we don't have to notice it, but new arrivals to ANT, considering their options, will be dealing with these things. Give it like 12 months of more fresh arrivals to Prun.


[26-Oct-24 08:53 PM] zillatron#0000
not sure i agree with your definition of an exodus, but thanks for elaborating all the same


[26-Oct-24 09:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's the same in the other places... Maybe not for HUB or ARC... Once the Triple Green worlds get filled, all new bases will have to start considering the Single or Double Red worlds, for expansion. Shipping concerns are key for BASIC/PROs... They'll either have to start buying more ships, FTL or STL (with gateways), to just even do business, so there'll be quite a lag time between the newer people having the funding to expand, then actually do expand, and start selling their production with each other or on the CX. 

My best guess, is that you won't see the results of my predictions for like another 2 years... Since people will be able to go to diversify with Electronica, Nike, Aceland, Elon, KI-401 or else... But you will see the market realities sooner, since people will now try to leverage the surplus markets for production, without having adequate I/Os to justify internal stuff.

------

The gateways will be involved in this sort of "boiling pot" arrangement. And of course, older players will largely be unaffected by this. But I'm doing an aggregate approach.... I.e. We have our friends.... and then there's the other 2k+ players in Prun. üôÇ

**For just this channel?**.... ~400-500 days in-game... R-fab, or A-fab HQ upgrade progressions, plus multiple ships purchased/built, to be **qualified to contribute**. A second qualification is to those who will be **willing to contribute, without immediate returns**. My suggestions, since anyone in both brackets, can eat up the production costs, without too many issues.

Anyone else... You're better off organising in a separate Gateway production channel. **You'll likely be looking at ADI issued grants, + private loans, + some sort of shipping arrangement, all at a net return of some form of profitable earnings (especially with the R/A+ fabs and materials).** <--- (Evov, potential idea, or no?)

I blame dev #greed..... They could have just focused on multi-corp HQs.... And would have been done with this development cycle much sooner, than with these gateways... And the tangible benefits to MOST people, in-game, would have been readily seen, since it's something that we're all familiar with.

@scintillating_iridescence a number of members have expressed concerns over the essay-length tangents being posted both in #agc-general and elsewhere in the server. they make it difficult to read what other people are trying to say and they derail conversations away from topics people actually bring up.

i'm going to have to ask you to please stop such behavior. people make jokes about brevity, but it's more of an actual request. i feel that much of what you have to say can be condensed into much less paragraphs.

when typing something up, consider if it is necessary and relevant to the topic at hand.


[27-Oct-24 05:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
The main issue is that those planets are generally inferior


[27-Oct-24 05:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
In resources, not just base cost


[27-Oct-24 05:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
There are a lot of good ones out there, but they're also very isolated. The universe basically suffers from having all the core worlds being too _generally_ good even if they're not the very best


[27-Oct-24 05:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
Gateways would be a feasible thing to those planets but they're also not so much better that it would pay off... Idk really how to fix it


[27-Oct-24 05:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
They'd have to heavily manipulate resource density in random places so that the whole universe is more evenly distributed, instead of best planets for climate AND really good planets for resources being in the core


[27-Oct-24 05:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm 100% sure were not. Gateways need voters, and funding/production. I'm just exploring the potential scope.

On the topic of gateway coordination, next up, I'd like to finalize the prices. I intend for them to be stable through the project. Adjusting them is possible, but likely to upset folks, so nailing them down in advance would be best. 

I have proposed prices listed on the "Gateway Prices" list. Basically I'm looking for feedback on the relative values of each item. These are calculated primarily via base-area-days. The PP30D Universe prices are listed, but you can compare them to any price index or internal prices you would like to. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oET7LURFw6m-3iKu_5n8iT2SWS4PU-P-hiH6fMazWmU/edit?gid=543632564#gid=543632564

Also the ledger sheet is set up to receive pledges of cash contributions. If someone doesn't want to manage their own cash contribution, as a project coordinator, I will coordinate the purchases of the most-needed gateway products with the cash contribution and see that each contributor is credited appropriately. 

After wrapping up feedback on the "Gateway Prices" list, we can begin a wider solicitation of gateway products.

For better or worse, this seems to be the default town square for gateway discussions. It's the place where potential groups from different regions come together to collaborate and collectively discuss/resolve potential road blocks.

Now that there's a firm goal in place for the first gateway link planned... would it make sense to spin off a channel specifically for the plans relating to that gateway link, while maintaining a channel for general gateway discussion / collaboration etc ?


[27-Oct-24 10:00 PM] archielvahr#0000

My plan regarding cash contributions is to spend contributed cash on the materials that offer the "most shares per AIC"- with the caveat that they need to be available. Some things are just going to be tough to get at any price.

Since we're something like 8 months out from the updates (or earlier)... I've added an inflation-based price adjustment to the "Gateway - Prices" on the sheet, based off the PP30D values. (we're still behind like x2 months on Economy reports :/)

They might not matter if we're basically on the same standard of stock conversion, but they should matter if CX ASK/BID rates get adjusted, due to player decisions, which will offer opportunities for AGC to buy what's needed at cheaper rates. Small gains with small mistakes. Big gains with big mistakes. -- The rest is good, imo.

[29-Oct-24 07:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
They're both good? *LS-231 a/d are on the same environmental requirements anyways. LS-231a is depreciated. LS-231d is running a CON COGC*. **LS-231b is a huge source of LST, with a RES COGC, which feeds PP1/2 BBH|BSE processes at LS-231c/d in CON COCGs, plus FE|AL imports**. 

BRM extraction (feeding REA/SOI work) on LS-231c has silly profits (like 225k daily), but that's because the CX rates are very high, which feeds into FIO integrated sheets (even without COGC bonuses). PP1/2 processes there have a ~36k AIC daily profit, without considering internal supply.

Rates on LS-231c's RES COGC for LST/SIO are ~160k/40k daily - **shipping not included**....


[29-Oct-24 07:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you want to boost LST/SIO imports to ANT/BEN CX, go with LS-231b. If you want to boost BBH/BSE imports to the same, go with LS-231c. **My vote is with Aratora (LS-231b)**


[29-Oct-24 07:32 PM] tanda#0000
both of them will likely be used. It's just a matter of which one we need a bunch of voting AGC members on to make sure the gates are solid

How does Fly path calculated for FTL departure/arrival? I've noticed it's usually in the middle of the system (between 3rd and 4th planet)... I might be wrong


[29-Oct-24 09:42 PM] pi3142718#0000
Who‚Äôs going to use LS-231b for resource extraction? It‚Äôs a hot planet so will be super expensive, especially once TSH are in high demand for gateways


[29-Oct-24 09:43 PM] pi3142718#0000
If you‚Äôre looking for lots of bases, a hot planet isn‚Äôt the way to go

Yeah the devs are pushing SET/TEC/ENG+ production, with the gateway content long into the future. At least our initial gateway targets have TSH/PSH requirements not only as potential base build requirements, but also for the gateways themselves.


[29-Oct-24 10:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Before BL was available I had BTS rigs on Aratora. It wasn‚Äôt so bad. 

Looks like I see one voice in support of Aratora and a few others leaning towards SL-231c for the gate.


[30-Oct-24 04:22 PM] akyantor#0000
I have a bias for Aratora, if only because I already have a base there, so could support maintaining control via an existing base.


[31-Oct-24 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'd want to run something other than RE for BTS or LST, but I'd rather not impact a bunch of guys already there, so I think 231c


[31-Oct-24 09:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
also just want to say I'm not sure where you keep getting this date from, they release on a biannual schedule, typically


[31-Oct-24 09:29 AM] hernanduer#0000

[31-Oct-24 09:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
they do 2 content patches and 2 "balance" patches every year, so the content is biannual

Mmm, Archiel's plugging away at the #marketing.... T'is good.

If anyone's got some spare time, idling on Prun... Can they just mock up some BLUs for the usual FTL ship metrics... Starter | WCB | LCB | VCB..... and the mass-market options that everyone's seeing on UFO and elsewhere --- FSE/QCR | WCB | LCB | VCB, and just grab some basic daily data, on ANT <--> BEN FTL transits, for like a week? (once daily, for all, for just 1 week)...


[13-Nov-24 03:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I think the gateway fuel metrics have also been **mocked** up on the spreadsheet... 

We can fiddle with the gateway fuel requirements right now per the info posted on OOG site, and some quick maths. Assume some given **x** for resource densities on any Krypton planet around ANT. What sort of assumed PPUs for Krypton can be had?

We'll be under the discretion of #dev Perlin noise metrics for those resource distributions... So it'll be random, but we can get differentials for whatever is to come.


[13-Nov-24 03:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes those.

[13-Nov-24 03:46 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Figures from the SF/FF + depreciation transit metrics above, can get plugged into a price ceiling for gateway tolls.

Figures from **assumed** VF ppu's + transport, based on daily gateway usage, will then from the price floors for gateways.


[13-Nov-24 03:48 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I think we've all beaten up any issue on the gateways completely. Some provisional metrics could be handy, since we've got like maybe 1-2 months on the minimum, to try to advocate for cheaper gateway costs on the forums or whatever.

We will likely plan at least one more pair before the release date.

In case anyone wanted to buy components to contribute to the project, this is my current CX holdings for building gateways. IMM / PSH / RSH production has started - just haven't shipped any back to a CX yet, but production capacity for all currently available parts is rolling.

It's unlikely that the tax funded gateway project I'm working on will be needing these parts before the Heph-LS231 link, so hit me up if any of them look like they'll be a bottleneck for this project.

[15-Nov-24 09:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmm. So I was letting the issues of long-term gateway funding .... ferment and stew in my rotting brain for about a month, and I think I've come up with a potential business idea to be used with Liquidity contributions, coupled with expanding Antares economic activity, and player interaction into the gatway hubs, or special planet projects that might be around.

However, I'm no area expert outside of intensive agricultural and basic consumable production, so someone should work through the metrics of this "idea", at least on the I/O and profitability side...


[15-Nov-24 09:53 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I glanced through the current pledges, and there seem to be some slack, at least on the SP | CBL things. I then was reminded, that those things are a part of the NPC MMs all around....

What if, we could setup some rather unorthodox MM projects for these things with the pledged liquidity...

Given standard weekly payments for permit usage, build/repair + consumable costs, outsourced shipping, and whatnot included for a project member willing to contribute permits and ques.... While also sourcing excess stocks from members here involving those inputs, or surplus market supplies -- if not full 20 person systemic designs.


[15-Nov-24 09:59 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The noted items:

* ECA | CBL; SP for gateway [Stock && Revenues]
* APF | ADS; COM for gateway [Stock} -- WR; LIS; LOG; NV1 for gateway [Revenues]
* SE/SL | IMM for gateway [Stock, and intermediaries for APF inputs] -- EDC/IDC for gateway [Revenues]

All three can be toggled... Meaning if we need something for another #serial gateway, we can just toggle the revenue production, into a stock production. If we're full, back to MM revenue production.

The value conversions for all of that will be tricky -- I'm just dropping this for some alpha testing if people wanna look into it.


[16-Nov-24 02:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
The gateway map tool has been upgraded with a new feature! You can now draw multiple gateways at once, so you don't have to stitch together screenshots! There's a "Clear Gateways" button to reset what is drawn.

[16-Nov-24 08:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also I've been able to connect with a few more key parties and have finalized LS-231c as the planet for the first gateway link with Heph. We have full support of the current inhabitants. 

What will happen next on the planet:
* We'll drop maybe 5+ bases to secure the governorship
* Build up the sci population to support AAFs (Which will include some popi buildings and probably upgrade the WAR to 2k)
* Expect to keep the COGC as construction, but I'd be supportive of a scheduled swap to Manuf during the AAF construction.

The GWS must be built on-site that's 40d of AAF. The 5x SST is 1500t each and will probably be made on site, that's 10d of AAF time. The TOR will probably be made onsite and that's 40d of WEL time, so construction will be good there. 

PFGs will probably be built on Heph and brought in. 

A few of us will be dropping our first bases there to start building up experts. As the population grows, we'll be happy to take more ADI inhabitants to ensure the security of the planet and the co-op's goals.


[16-Nov-24 08:37 PM] tanda#0000
oh you need WEL bases on site? I was planning on dropping two bases of WEL in that system


[16-Nov-24 08:38 PM] tanda#0000
Can I ask if you have a timeline on establishing these bases?


[16-Nov-24 08:40 PM] evov#0000
GWS is the only part that's too big to be shipped as far as I'm aware. It requires other parts built from the same building (AAF) - so it kind of makes sense to build them all in the same place - but not required.


[16-Nov-24 08:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah that sounds good. Once the first gateway link from ANT is established, I can start leveraging my STL fleets to haul in materials for subsequent gateway construction, or just to support the local industries that will likely be dropped, at minimal shipping costs (since yeah I have no use for my excess ships).


[16-Nov-24 09:00 PM] evov#0000
I suspect there will be delays before the GWS can actually be built though. One of the longer chains from when the patch goes live I think looks like -

Extract - RHO (3733 -unknown extraction time)
Smelt - RHE ( 2334 - 8960 hrs @100% )
Advanced Smelt - ALR / WRH ( 2000 / 1000 - 6400 hrs @100% )
Weld - TOR (10 - 280hrs @100% )
+AAF - SST ( 5 - 240hrs @100%)
AAF - GWS (5 - 955hrs @100% )

You don't need each stage to be 100% complete before starting the next stage, but you need "enough" of each stage produced to begin the next step.

There's other steps that share AAF time that can't be started until the patch goes live, but a lot of the inputs can be pre-made for those steps. AAF's could Start making PFG/SST while waiting for the RHO/RHE/ALR/WRH/TOR to catch up. So the above chain seems like it'll be the main bottleneck re-time. So get ready to slap down Extractors asap, and have a fleet of Smelters and ASM's ready to go imo.


[16-Nov-24 09:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
I dunno, probably tomorrow. I've got the permit free and everything other than that is a rounding error

[16-Nov-24 09:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
As for the times there... I am expecting a lot of people to go hard on the RHO right away. A lot of people have SMEs, so I think that will naturally distribute itself quickly and broadly. the alloy smelting also has a lot of capacity... so I'm hoping it's really not a terrible bottleneck. AAFs kinda don't make anything important, and there aren't a million of them in the world like there are SMEs/ ASMs.

As for the PFGs that I'm making, I am gathering those parts already, so those can start immediately


[16-Nov-24 09:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, well... The intermediate, and upstream I/Os for production can be already mapped. What we don't know is the downstream resource concentrations for the new material/resource densities. 

We can argue if this, or if that, but if we just plop down an arbitrary and set schedule, we can just pick a good option for the downstream stuff, on patch day when the FIO API gets updated.


[16-Nov-24 09:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And I wouldn't put money on the RHO stuff to be rather efficient regarding price dynamics on the CXs.

The RHO --> RHE --> ALR/WRH processes are a "captive market", so the only ones to be interested in purchasing intermediate, or production stocks off anyone, or even the CX, would be those actively participating in gateway production. 

So it's not a B2C (business to consumer) market, rather a B2B (business to business) market, and so price inefficiencies (say if current CX listings are better than your PP metrics, you're gonna snatch those right away, and just wait for everyone else to burn out).


[16-Nov-24 09:38 PM] jcheung#0000
I don't believe any of that is a current concern?


[16-Nov-24 09:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Maybe people rush in from Day 0.. Get a bunch on the market... We snatch whatever is to be had on the cheap... Those early adopters get burned out due to detrimental price metrics + price competition... And then we'd be forced to setup our own permits to get what we need.


[16-Nov-24 09:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, if not, then just ignore me.

[29-Nov-24 03:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm also looking for more ADI people to build on LS-231c to help hold the planet. It's construction COGC for now, but will shift to manufacturing later.


[29-Nov-24 05:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I suppose the same long-term constraints, that we've been slapping with other in these channels, for months, is probably limiting many from getting interested in LS-231c right now (ships, permits, money --- you 'know the usual stuff)....

I'll sweeten the settlement concerns, in proffering x6 WCB STL ships, to be offered at minimal contractual cost (fuel + depreciation +transit fees + 10% margin), around ~March '2025, to anyone wanting to run profitable businesses on LS-231c, who's an ADI plebian. üòõ

This will expand to 12 WCB STLs, once the BEN connection is had.


[29-Nov-24 05:36 PM] jcheung#0000
mfg as the long term permanent?


[29-Nov-24 05:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That's done via any PRO/BASIC/TRIAL user voting on the COGC every ten days. It's not a GOV thing... But then again few are interested in the voting stuff anyways. Just don't make any noise, and I think no one will notice anything...

They'll just pull FIO data, and make their decisions based off it.


[29-Nov-24 05:39 PM] evov#0000
People get interested pretty quickly when their construction base is no longer getting a construction cogc.


[29-Nov-24 05:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes, but there's only a few permits on that planet... Some diplomacy and networking would be advantageous in that regard, since you don't need to pull like 300+ base plot #s to just get the player names to send DMs to.


[29-Nov-24 05:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
------------

On a different note... I was reading the recent dev logs a few days ago, and there's apparently fulfilment timers for the GOV <--> Contractor contracts for Gateway construction?

We could add another section on the front-page of the ADI sheet, to just tell what we're able to transfer, on a moments notice at a CX, so that we're not running on false assumptions, and not engaging on gateway conts that we won't be able to fulfil, reasonably, with just commodities on hand. 

It a'int a serious concern.


[29-Nov-24 06:02 PM] jcheung#0000
gov has a say in it. i'm asking the person who's asking for help gaining a controlling share of the planet what the long term goal is, because it's pretty easy to assume that.... we'll be helping maintain cocg as well


[29-Nov-24 06:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mechanically, GOV doesn't ... But on a psychological | sociological | statistical perspective? Yeah, they probably do. 

If I were in your position, I'd advocate to adjust tax rates to fill COGC requirements + COGC votes, weekly. --- COGC upkeeps are minuscule, since they are rate'd on a per "active base" thing. You just need some inbound and cheap shipping, if no one will do that for you.

It's slightly out of this channel's scope... But once the gateway update drops, with everything that we've discussed in here, and in the previous #ADI-thread.... Some of you will find yourselves in a parliamentary role, of some sort. Messy af? Yes.

[29-Nov-24 06:43 PM] tanda#0000
If I remember correctly it is planned to stay Construction in the long run, but requires being flipped to manufacturing in order to expidite the new gate materials (SPT,GWS,TRS), due to large size making it necessary to build in place


[29-Nov-24 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000

<--- has no mental filter, since I speak whatever's on my mind, and I like to give ideas out. 

Archiel's the team lead anyways. Go with what they state as fact.


[29-Nov-24 07:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But, per Tanda... If the COGC switch from CON --> MANF --> CON, is just a limited time thing... 

There is reason to just keep it as a CON COGC, and just avoid the negative sentiment from anyone's Prunner/rPrun logs that "get affected", and lets just eat the additional upkeep for the build?


[29-Nov-24 07:36 PM] tanda#0000
Except the build in place items are more important. At that point we're talking about saving 25% of time rather than increasing profit for getting the final pieces built out as soon as possible


[29-Nov-24 07:37 PM] tanda#0000
Especially considering ADI/AGC members dropping on that planet would be mostly doing it in order to hold down the planet and protect it from being flipped and redirected, I think most would be willing to eat the COGM increase


[29-Nov-24 07:50 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The build-in-place mats are a serious concern, since they're a bottle neck. You have me on that Tanda.

However, last I checked on the dev-logs, the redirection is via motion, which is a 1-2 day thing? And any non-ADI gateway construction contract would last for a month, or so, before default termination.


[29-Nov-24 07:51 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's my recommendation, that you'll get more on-site political favours, if you just reach out to the PMs on LS-231c (an of course Hephaestus), lay out our plans, and gather support/contention, and offer sounds ideas, should those GOVs remain in-tact for the long term. 

Beating up current GOVs, just cuz we might have a lot of money/commodities to spend/invest on a given planet, whose usual weekly GOV stuff will be almost entirely unaffected, is not a good idea, imo. But that's just me. :/


[29-Nov-24 07:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well sounds like there‚Äôs currently no one on the planet?


[29-Nov-24 07:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I blame devs for the gateway plans. It could be simpler with a different approach, but we're getting what's laid out. y_y


[29-Nov-24 07:55 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Like 3 bases on LS-231c... More on LS-231b (Aratora).


[29-Nov-24 08:01 PM] tanda#0000

[29-Nov-24 10:29 PM] archielvahr#0000

[29-Nov-24 10:31 PM] archielvahr#0000

[02-Dec-24 11:58 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Those upkeep costs, were entirely unexpected.

Dev is likely trying to push SET/TEC utilisation, via long-term means, even more. 

I'd recommend re-evaluating cost indexes for gateway construction/long-term upkeep.....

Dev seems to be pushing long-term, STL based transport incentives, for outlier base production, over STL/FTL transit incentives.


[02-Dec-24 12:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If there is a gateway spawned in the test server.... Someone let me know.


[02-Dec-24 12:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that adds a bit of "ouch" to the tenuous ROI situation. The SPT is cheap, I have it at $323/u. POW at 6k, SP at 3k, SEA at 100.. Around 500k like Ielisa said... I don't mind the upkeep but we're very unsure about the value a gateway is going to generate


[02-Dec-24 12:16 PM] .shiva.#0000
Starting to feel like negative value tbh lol


[02-Dec-24 12:17 PM] .shiva.#0000
FF isn't that expensive, ship time is more so, but it feels like the tolls would need to be *very* high to cover the cost of running/fueling the gateway, let alone giving ROI on the gateway build itself


[02-Dec-24 12:28 PM] tanda#0000
Well, let's just hope it's not final numbers


[02-Dec-24 06:08 PM] realbandit#0000
Yeah the POW is the only concern there - SPT and SEA are tiny quantities, and the SP is already being mass produced for gateways.
If the devs have calculated the numbers right, the upkeep costing this much may be a good thing as it implies the travel speed will be significantly faster than regular FTL.
Quick maths on lets say Montem>Kiruna: 200 flights per day at maximum, each regular public shipping costing ~30k, so if the travel time was instant, it could generate 6M worth at most per day (or 3M if you count the trip back as empty) before fuel cost (which based on the numbers so far seems quite low).
Likely the numbers would be close to 50-100 flights per day, perhaps scaling up over time, and the speed only a bit faster than regular FTL, which puts the value at 50 flights x (10k-500) = 475k per day of profit, or 237.5k counting the trip back as empty). Upkeep being ~70k can easily be covered.

But of course, this means only 200k-400k gets generated to provide ROI, so thats looking at 2-4+ years to pay for itself, assuming players are fine gaining little monetary benefit from gates and just gaining the speed convenience.


[02-Dec-24 06:09 PM] realbandit#0000
I actually expected the upkeep to cost more than this - though it will be felt harder on non CX gates that don't gain as much traffic.
Any branching routes will have to seriously look at these costs.


[02-Dec-24 06:11 PM] realbandit#0000
And to put it in context, we're spending 250M on a gateway already, this upkeep only costs about 0.03% of that per day.


[02-Dec-24 06:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm expecting a 30k travel fee to be too high, and it's really hard to imagine 200 flights per day each way. I guess it's a good baseline but I was expecting more like 25 trips at 10k each

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02-Dec-24 06:22 PM] realbandit#0000
Yeah, it is a bit hard to guess the numbers at this point
Gateways starting with 200 flights per day, and each capacity upgrade adding more, is the worry I have that the devs aren't checking the numbers right.
Or they have, and they know the rate is that high?


[02-Dec-24 06:24 PM] realbandit#0000
I definitely think gateways could charge a lot more though, I'd pay a lot for speed convenience for my 2 lone ships lol
10k would be dirt cheap for a faster route, I'd be happy paying up to 50k if it was twice the speed, but i'm guessing not many others would be.


[02-Dec-24 06:25 PM] jcheung#0000
depending on how much of a speed boost it is, i might be fine with paying 30k per jump.... but at 30k a leg, it better be a damn sight faster üòÖ


[02-Dec-24 06:25 PM] tanda#0000
30k one way transit and I get it in 24 hours? Sounds about like hiring Darkfuel for a transfer already

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[02-Dec-24 06:28 PM] realbandit#0000
If the devs are choosing same time per jump (any more word on that?) then the longer routes will be even more valuable
I believe Montem>Curie is at maximum of 24.9 Pc - that could charge a lot


[02-Dec-24 06:28 PM] tanda#0000
Not sure about gate fuel costs, but with 500k being ballpark maintenance cost, 30k transit fees covers the daily cost in 3 jumps

{Reactions}

[02-Dec-24 06:29 PM] realbandit#0000
Gate fuel costs I expect to be rather low, I ran the numbers a few weeks ago and it could be as little as 500 credits per trip lol


[02-Dec-24 06:29 PM] realbandit#0000
could be a x10 though, but even 5k is only as much as a regular FTL trip


[02-Dec-24 06:30 PM] tanda#0000

[02-Dec-24 06:33 PM] realbandit#0000
SNF has been in the lithium game for quite a while hehe
And it's not so much POW that it'll be an issue, only about 1 ECA worth


[02-Dec-24 06:34 PM] realbandit#0000
Though that is 1 ECA per gate...
Including EXT/SME, maybe 1/3 of a base per gateway upkeep?


[02-Dec-24 06:38 PM] realbandit#0000
Running the numbers it's about 3/4 of a base needed per gate upkeep - thats for the entire chain of all items.

I've been chatting with a few people from Benten, esp @cptcoleslaw  and @eminence32, I'm hopeful about coordinating gateways there too.


[02-Dec-24 09:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since they aren't as far along with their gateway production, my personal idea is that the AGC's third coop gate might go from LS-231c (Styx) to Katoa. And then perhaps the Benten folks could be responsible for the return link.


[02-Dec-24 09:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
This has some really nice advantages for the control side- Antares doens't have to be involved in the government of Katoa, and would still control both gateways around Styx-c. If the gateway funds from both gates get mushed together, we wouldn't be able to separate them anyway, so that works well with the model in place for the gateway cooperative.

[03-Dec-24 05:50 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Word on the street (testserver), is that none of the fancy new commands, nor any gateway instances have been implemented, beyond the GTWI. 

So we won't have any data to use in projections, until we setup a viable gateway service, and go from there. :/


[03-Dec-24 06:26 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I was hoping that these gateways would serve as a tool, to expedite the growth of the more... out of reach planets:

1) to spool up profitable, higher end, commodity production, and
2) to open up less capital intensive ship designs for sale (STLs only.)

But those hopes are only based on the compounding maths of long-term investments/costs, and don't really take into account that 90% of Prun's player-base are trials, with only ~500-1000 PROs who will be able to use any gateway, to their fullest, in the long-term. 

So I'm with realbandit, in viewing these gateways as a very long term thing... But the game might be different in 2-4 years. We shall see.


[03-Dec-24 06:28 AM] tanda#0000
After the CX's I strongly think we'll likely see productive clusters given priority (KI-401 and surrounding systems here in ANT). Such projects would have an incredibly long ROI, though

I've been chatting with other gateway teams, and the folks in Benten are onboard with the connection to ANT space. 

I proposed that the ADI Gateway Coop build and run the gate from Styx to BEN, and their organization take care of the gate from BEN to Styx. This gives us a connection without having to manage and upkeep the gate in BEN space. It also works out production-wise as our first gate pair is in pretty good shape and they are just starting their efforts.

[06-Dec-24 02:14 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Uhm... I hate to be a debbie downer... But I'd recommend an #on-call collection pool, of pledged mats, on the front page... Anyone's who has pledged mats, can add-in their available stock buffers. 

That info can then be used as a real expectations, whenever devs do drop the gateway updates, so that there's no surprises?

For those working on the LIT.... its a real #pita-pie. üò¶

Excess stocks can be figured in a FIFO rule, for new AGC gateways, or transfers to other entities, based on some rules which haven't been considered, based on whatever --- just ideas.


[06-Dec-24 02:35 PM] jvaler#0000
what does this mean? the pledge list is already on the front page of the sheet


[06-Dec-24 02:35 PM] jcheung#0000
the pledge amount afaik is the amount you promise to provide when requested, not everything that is currently in your inventory....


[06-Dec-24 02:36 PM] jcheung#0000
which could be like purchase from the CX


[06-Dec-24 02:47 PM] jvaler#0000
i thought stuff being bought would fall under the monetary pledge category?


[06-Dec-24 02:47 PM] jvaler#0000
unless they already have a trade deal lined up for a specific item, then it makes sense not to


[06-Dec-24 02:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's generally the intent. I wouldn't suggest pledging items you don't make with the plan to buy them on the CX, post gateway launch.

[06-Dec-24 04:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
In my book (and in most IRL fundraising... pledges are guarantees).... But since we're dealing with a #whenever release, and not some set deadline, it may raise an issue.

Hilarious, but no I don't lead CU. That's MysteriousWalrus. And I believe there's already plans to build some gate ways, not sure. Been kinda inactive for a bit with work. All I know is some people have cranked up their fab production and there was some talk about a copper world


[06-Dec-24 07:02 PM] tanda#0000
oh so there is some level of interest. Great!


[07-Dec-24 05:02 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
HRT is a patchwork. Lots of people start or expand over there for foodies. All the "established" entities that you've had discussions with, have interests in the area. 

Maybe you can sell the idea of an AGC type collaboration, with all, for something in HRT to be eventually selected, and the arrangements to be formalised at a much later time?

i thought they were just close enough for a link


[15-Dec-24 02:10 PM] tanda#0000
no, that's because there's not a large political body in HRT with gateway plans. I believe that CU has some plans, but that's the last I heard of it

[15-Dec-24 02:14 PM] tanda#0000
keep in mind these gateways are perfectly functional. Even a partially complete gateway will reduce the travel time on that CX route


[15-Dec-24 02:15 PM] tanda#0000
and the map is "currently planned connections" so more or less gateways that will be able to be put up within 1-2 months of the update actually dropping


[15-Dec-24 05:52 PM] realbandit#0000
90% of the CLR time for Gateways is for MTC, NFI, and NCS
~600 MTC, ~60k NCS, ~400k NFI per gateway (varies on upgrades)
Still means a significant amount of time on the other electronics if only want to make those, but they go into more complicated chains so people likely already have them running.
~1.6k TRN is the largest of the rest, though CX's normally have that in sufficient bulk.


[16-Dec-24 04:31 AM] sgt.skeleton#0000
not the ben one


[16-Dec-24 04:31 AM] sgt.skeleton#0000

Inside that update post there are some materials needed and cash purchase prices listed!


[18-Dec-24 11:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm considering asking a question about the cost/benefits of the gateways as they stand. We aren't really sure how fast they are and we know the upkeep is pretty costly at 500k a week.  I think they need to be very fast to justify the costs. (Even if you ignore the sunk cost of construction)


[18-Dec-24 01:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
They indicated they weren't sure about the balance of the upkeep and will adjust it as it goes


[18-Dec-24 02:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
The CBL, LIT, and HSE has ben supplied


[18-Dec-24 03:03 PM] eminence32#0000
i've always wondered if the large costs of gateways was (in part, not exclusively) designed to simply be a large resource sink to help keep the billionaires in-check


[18-Dec-24 03:07 PM] realbandit#0000
I think HQ's already do that enough
Gateways are more aimed at a wider range of items, especially items that weren't even made before (at least not at any proper scale) like MTC, PSH, LIT, SP, etc.
It definitely might appeal to more billionaires though - I'm on Basic (for now) and so HQ's was locked out to me, but Gateways on the other hand?


[18-Dec-24 03:09 PM] eminence32#0000
i sort of agree that the HQs upgrades already do that, but that only works for players who are trying to expand their HQ


[18-Dec-24 03:18 PM] realbandit#0000
Exactly, still there would be a high correlation: chasing HQ = more bases = more profit lol
But I suppose they could have designed Gateways to catch the rest of the billionaires like you say


[18-Dec-24 08:08 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I'm sure there is a point where an HQ level would be as expensive as a gateway..

{Reactions}
Death 

[19-Dec-24 02:22 AM] realbandit#0000
Yep, Fire's already at that level lol
gateway costs ~250M, and the current highest HQ known is ~260M
In fact Fire would have spent ~2.5B in total on HQ upgrades so far


[19-Dec-24 10:57 AM] sgt.skeleton#0000
i thought they were 400mil?


[19-Dec-24 11:02 AM] realbandit#0000
Technically it can be as the maximum upgraded gateway can reach 400M, but that would be 3xVolume, and is unlikely to be built, I think those were also early estimates on GWS and have since dropped a bit.
The base Gateway is about 210M depending on whose prices you use, and on that same metric the HQ would be 250M


[19-Dec-24 12:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Current highest HQ? I might beg to differ. I have a 95 --> 99% confidence interval, in a 100 HQ level upgrade costing ~31 bil, with a cost sum of ~400 bil from HQ level 2. But this is banter, lol. üôÇ


[19-Dec-24 12:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
As for the gateways... I think the devs are pulling another Eve Online trick. Building up experimental server infrastructure (which may be used in other novel features in the future), while providing some, albeit "intangible" market incentives for such things.

If any of you have played Eve, think of the player driven-market for Upwell structure construction, and sales. It's the best example that I can think of, when considering the direction that the devs are not only trying out right now, but something that's also hinted at with their long-term roadmap.


[19-Dec-24 12:38 PM] realbandit#0000
Not sure what you're getting at here?
This is literally the highest HQ currently known, and it costs around 250M, which is equivalent to a Gateway, which is what superbadsounds was speculating about.

Fine... ~~Current~~ Estimated values. I'll drop my findings on the PCT discord, in the hq research, rather than here, in a day or so, cuz #channels. 

But the ever increasing values of HQ upgrade requirements.. should be hitting a x2 gateway cost at about HQ level ~57 --> 58. That will then be hitting the investment choice of private/self-funded operations, versus public/group-funded operations, more akin to POPR/POPI stuff on planets. It's actually a theme.

I have my own gripe regarding the "upkeeps" that molp posted like 2 weeks ago.. But devs have data that we just don't, so we'll see what comes about.


[19-Dec-24 05:27 PM] superbadsounds#0000
From my own brief look into future upgrade costs, it seemed like upgrades were grouped into decades, with HQ 1-10 costing roughly 1m, HQ 11-20 costing 10m, 100m for 21-30... so on and so on... assuming the same pattern for levels 51-100, that's like.. 1.1quadrillion..? ü§£

Hey, do we know what the upkeep for gateways will be? I'm thinking about getting involved but unsure where to start


[28-Dec-24 12:55 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Thinking about getting into energy component assembly but unsure if it will be required after initial build completion


[28-Dec-24 01:04 AM] realbandit#0000
The upkeep has been posted, about 500k worth per week

Gateways need a whole heap of SP, so if you're looking to get into ECA's it's a great start if you can source the materials - 8k SP per gate and lots of gateways to be built so I wouldn't worry about demand drying up


[28-Dec-24 01:10 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Perfect, has anyone else claimed to be starting a SPplanet? I'm aleady producing SP but I can ramp up if no one else has

I have cash contributions that I am under an obligation to responsibly spend! So I have orders up for a lot of SP on ANT and Moria


[28-Dec-24 10:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
So if you're new or need the cash, contributing that way is very helpful. I can stretch the prices a little bit for new players and small orders, but generally speaking here's the list of prices I can accept (the "bid" column):

R.E. TSH - I think I'm doing about 160/week, so I'm only about 3 weeks away from hitting my production target. After that I'll actively dump it into the market or change production.

My goal (arbitrary as it may be) is to solo produce all the parts needed for building a gateway (at least everything above the smelter level - it's just not possible for me to extract + smelt all the ores / metals needed solo). Once that goal is reached, I doubt I'll have much need for a thousand TSH's üôÇ


[28-Dec-24 10:24 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I'm currently making 75 TSH/wk with more production on the way. I will be looking to have about 1K TSH on hand by the time things go live.

[05-Jan-25 11:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
We are doing very nicely overall. First pair is nearly completely pledged, and the third gate is at about 50%.


[15-Jan-25 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
I ran an audit yesterday on my stockpile vs. the purchases I've made so far with cash contributions and everything balanced nicely. I haven't lost anything that I've bought so far. 

Many of the purchases were made in MOR and shipped over because we got a lot of cash contributions in NCC (people gotta get rid of it somehow!)

In particular, the SP buy orders have been an ongoing success. 

We now have two gateways fully pledged, with the third at 76.4%. I think we're still a while away from the gateways releasing, since we don't have a dev log with a flight through a gateway yet. But it's likely time to begin thinking about the 4th gate. I think the spot that makes the most sense is Heph to IA-151. IA-151 is one natural linking point to Hortus. It's also the location of @evov's gateway project, so we won't be duplicating effort with multiple gates going to the same place. Discussions welcome üôÇ

If the BEN team doesn't have their gateway together, materials will be redirected towards the BEN -> Hekaton link to complete the pair instead.

over in the BEN system, we're still making progress towards our gateway, but we have some really big gaps in our production capabilities.  for example, we don't yet have anyone who's pledged the 1200.  so if @evov you want to dump excess TSH our way (once you're done with your own gateways), we'll gladly accept it


[25-Jan-25 05:36 PM] eminence32#0000
here's a quick snapshot of were we stand:

I've met my production goals for TSH (1200+) and re-allocated those production lines. Happy to spin them up again if needed.


[25-Jan-25 05:40 PM] eminence32#0000
(also i didn't mean to single out EvoV there.  anyone with excess production capabilities can donate to the benten gateway ;))


[25-Jan-25 05:46 PM] evov#0000
Just looking at your list. A number of items you can comfortably fill from the CX as needed imo. But a few will probably require production rather than purchase. Ignoring the things not available yet (e.g. GWS etc)
LIT, PSH, RSH, TSH, SP - I think it will be difficult to fill these items from CX purchases.

Distance / Volume upgrades also add a non-trivial amount of things like LIT / PSH / Afabs


[25-Jan-25 05:55 PM] eminence32#0000
yeah, you have a good observation.  some people have offered us cash donations, and i've been thinking about how best to use that cash.  to continue using TSH as an example, the CX probably can't fulfill all 1200, which would cost 40mil or something like that).   so i'm thinking that in some cases, cash donations would be best spent on building out production lines


[25-Jan-25 05:58 PM] eminence32#0000
you "only" need 4.5 PP4s to make that much TSH in 100 days (of course you have to provide all the precursors)


[25-Jan-25 05:58 PM] evov#0000
They compete with CBL's for BE usage I think as well.


[25-Jan-25 06:00 PM] evov#0000
When I was designing my production for gateways - AML's were one of the things I had to meaningfully expand on. The amount of BE / TA that's required (along with other alloys after RHO becomes available) is significant.


[25-Jan-25 06:01 PM] eminence32#0000
do we need to fund a few new bases dedicated to BER extraction and processing?


[25-Jan-25 06:05 PM] evov#0000
Depends who "we" is. BER supply seemed ok last I checked. But another BER mine somewhere probably wouldn't hurt. AML's aren't cheap though, and gateways use a lot of them.


[25-Jan-25 06:06 PM] eminence32#0000
a general "we" meaning the people who are trying to get a benten gateway built


[25-Jan-25 06:11 PM] evov#0000
I'll have this list completed by the end of the week. Next step for me will be the pre-cursors for the "RED" items. If I know other projects are looking short on certain items I'll keep the production lines running on them if that helps.

[25-Jan-25 06:15 PM] evov#0000
My guess, is that it'll probably take between 1 and 2 months from when RHO and the new recipes are introduced until a gateway gets completed. So there's plenty of time left to build up stocks of those green/yellow items imo.


[25-Jan-25 06:36 PM] eminence32#0000
that's an impressive amount of **everything**


[25-Jan-25 07:29 PM] evov#0000
My goal is to solo produce a gateway. I think it would be cool to have a full gateway (with distance/volume) upgrades for sale. Kind of feels like a "final boss" when it comes to productive capacity in the game.

The 4th gateway is live on the sheet, so you can begin pledging materials for that anytime you'd like! Also we had someone who is leaving the game potentially withdrawing some afab pledges, so there's a lot of room for more afabs

so... not a huge amount


[31-Jan-25 10:54 PM] jcheung#0000
over a few months that'll add up though i suppose


[31-Jan-25 10:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
So once a contribution is made, it's "locked in". Pledges show intent and prevent people from doubling up production. There isn't really a deadline since we'll have a bit of a rolling construction period as gateways will come online over time.  If it looks like there are specific materials that are pledged that aren't getting filled, then we will check in with the pledgers and maybe take some action to get those into sync with the other products

Definitely don't contribute until you have "throwaway" levels of money. But at that point, go nuts üòâ


[01-Feb-25 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
The payouts might actually end up coming from the governments. Which is nice because the UI for payouts is way nicer than contracts. Info about min payouts is on the above page.


[01-Feb-25 10:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
Can I buy an absurdly small number of shares?


[01-Feb-25 10:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
just for fun


[01-Feb-25 10:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
or will that just make life hard for everyone


[01-Feb-25 10:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
like im thinking of just putting like 5k, so 30 ish shares


[01-Feb-25 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hehe yup,, go for it.


[01-Feb-25 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
I reocmmend just contributing anything on the sheet you already make or have laying around


[01-Feb-25 10:54 AM] pagy1234#0000
alr checked for that, have none of the materials you need D:


[01-Feb-25 10:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's actually very helpful to have a large number of contributors, even if they are small. Since your vote on gateway planets will help us control the gateways we build


[01-Feb-25 10:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh nice


[01-Feb-25 10:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
how do i send you the money>


[01-Feb-25 10:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
?


[01-Feb-25 10:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
just a buy order then cancel after payment?

You are now the proud owner of a small percentage of a future gateway üòé


[01-Feb-25 11:00 AM] pagy1234#0000
lets gooo :D


[01-Feb-25 11:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
You know, this is probably a good incentive to think about how we‚Äôd handle the payouts - maybe accruing money on the sheet until it hits a minimum threshold to pay out?


[01-Feb-25 11:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
(Unless this has already been thought about)


[01-Feb-25 11:02 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, that's the plan. It's outlined a bit in that doc.


[01-Feb-25 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
So there's a ledger showing total income, then from that we divide out everyone by share count to get their total lifetime income. We have a ledger for payouts, so we can calculate the amount due to each partner. (their lifetime earnings minus all payouts made to them so far)


[01-Feb-25 11:03 AM] sidepipe#0000
I should have guessed you‚Äôd thought about it already üòÑ


[01-Feb-25 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Then if they have a pending amount greater than the min payout (probably 25k?) they can get a payout


[01-Feb-25 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
that way if someone just doesn't get a payout, they don't "lose" it, they can get the larger payout later.


[01-Feb-25 11:04 AM] pagy1234#0000
for the big fish 25k will probably be very frequent


[01-Feb-25 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think big fish won't care to bother for less than a mil üòé


[01-Feb-25 11:04 AM] pagy1234#0000
but for my puny 64.something shares it will take decades to get 25kü§£


[01-Feb-25 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
We don't really know how it'll work out income-wise, but some real-life institutions with a min payment threshold will just send out the balance once a year even if it's under the threshold


[01-Feb-25 11:06 AM] pagy1234#0000
i dunno if il still here in a yearüòÇ


[01-Feb-25 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
There are survivorship rules on the page also, heh


[01-Feb-25 11:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
Sooo - how long until we calculate a fair market value for a gateway share based on the future payouts and start selling them like securities? üòÑ


[01-Feb-25 11:06 AM] tanda#0000
oh man


[01-Feb-25 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
That's the "Direct Share Transfers" part of the page


[01-Feb-25 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
By average input value and CX prices each share is worth $154.52. But the real value will come when we know how much cash they make üòé


[01-Feb-25 11:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
I sold Draconis some of my shares already


[01-Feb-25 11:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
once we have a few payouts, we could come up with a price as a perpetuity of the average payments. we'd just need some interest rate to do that

[01-Feb-25 11:34 AM] jvaler#0000
@archielvahr should pledges be deleted once actualized? so it doesn't count twice or something


[01-Feb-25 11:35 AM] jcheung#0000
probably not


[01-Feb-25 11:36 AM] jcheung#0000
there's a column for delivered


[01-Feb-25 11:36 AM] jcheung#0000
so if we add another column on pledges-and someone is working on it


[01-Feb-25 11:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Nope, I am adding a column to show how much of a pledge was completed


[01-Feb-25 11:37 AM] jvaler#0000
ooh nice


[01-Feb-25 11:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
Since someone might pledge 1000 SP in Dec, contribute 500 in Jan, then another 500 in Feb


[01-Feb-25 11:38 AM] jcheung#0000
good to know that our minds work similarly


[01-Feb-25 11:38 AM] jvaler#0000
ya i'm gonna be getting more CAAP payouts later, so the pledge will increase


[01-Feb-25 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also it's set up to minimize the chance of me screwing something up üòÖ  The in-game contracts don't last forever, but for a few month we can go back and verify contributions since I put dates on it. In case there's a typo or something


[01-Feb-25 11:41 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah i found that out trying to log data of faction conts i've recieved


[01-Feb-25 11:41 AM] jvaler#0000

[01-Feb-25 11:43 AM] jcheung#0000

[01-Feb-25 11:44 AM] jcheung#0000
the intermediate calcs section?  it's better as its own visible thing


[01-Feb-25 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
the formula to just output the final weighted output is.... not pretty


[01-Feb-25 11:50 AM] jvaler#0000
woah i've never thought to use concat like that before, that's smart


[01-Feb-25 11:50 AM] jcheung#0000

[01-Feb-25 11:51 AM] jcheung#0000
that's neat


[01-Feb-25 11:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
So I use those intermediate columns to calculate W8 to Z8. I wanted to do it all in those cells but it got to be too much


[01-Feb-25 11:57 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah, it's very doable in a single cell but for sanity's sake it's better you don't

[01-Feb-25 11:57 AM] archielvahr#0000

[01-Feb-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
its at least a little long


[01-Feb-25 12:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah so those sums are the following:
* Your actual material contributions
* Your credit from cash contributions (all materials purchased with cash get pooled, and you get a proportion of them)
* Any direct share transfers you got
* Minus any of your shares transfered to someone else
* Minus any materials purchased with bank funds that  were credited to someone else (that only happens for Cash Managers, and I'm the only one at the moment)


[01-Feb-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
damn, thats pretty insane


[01-Feb-25 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
So if someone gives me 10m, I turn around and buy 4000 SP. I donate the 4k SP under my name, but transfer the shares from that purchase into the person who gave me 10m


[01-Feb-25 12:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
The reason to track it like that is that:
* All cash contributions get pooled. This prevents me from making "good" purchases for one person donating cash, and "bad" purchases for someone else
* If I mess up and sell/lose/trade some SP I purchased, it remains on my personal balance sheet to make good later.


[01-Feb-25 12:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
* Since there's like 8 people contributing SP,a nd I'm buying SP, and I'm making SP. I don't need to track my inventory, just the ledger transactions to keep it accurate


[01-Feb-25 12:05 PM] pagy1234#0000
wow


[01-Feb-25 12:05 PM] pagy1234#0000

[02-Feb-25 04:28 AM] evov#0000
Wondering if the introduction of 5k5k ships will have any impact on planned gateway routes / positions.


[02-Feb-25 04:32 AM] evov#0000
Since it will need 3xVolume upgrades in order to fit the big ships through. Which only leaves 2 distance upgrads ( assuming 5 total upgrades ). = Linking radius of 20 instead of 25.


[02-Feb-25 04:36 AM] evov#0000
At least for the leg that I'm focused on (ANT -> HRT) it might have an impact. Moving the gate location to IA-158 instead of 151 means it's less than 20 range to ANT and HRT ... meaning it's possible to connect those two CX's for 5k5k travel.  Not as good for supporting local ANT region planets, but probably makes sense in the long term since I suspect a lot of CX-CX transport will be done using 5k5k ships in the future.


[02-Feb-25 04:42 AM] evov#0000
I'm not certain, but I think the ANT/HRT route can handle 2k ships if the mid point is IA-158.  And the MOR-BEN route can do it if the midpoint is the Nova System. I think both the north south routes - ANT-BEN  and MOR-HRT will either be limited to 2k2k ships, or will need to have a 1 system gap in the middle. I haven't done an exhaustive search, so there might be other options available.


[02-Feb-25 08:43 AM] jvaler#0000
@archielvahr it looks like SP is still needed for AGC, is it enough to warrant a new ECA base? or do you have anyone else with existing SP production?

now that my norwick base isn't tied up in a co-op and my vulcan base isn't a rise feeder base anymore, i'm thinking of moving my phobos food industries to norwick and using phobos for actual electronics.

cause for it to be profitable on the MM it needs to cost under 91k/u

wait


[02-Feb-25 08:56 AM] jvaler#0000
~~experts... i'm stupid~~ nvm that only took 300 off the cost lolol


[02-Feb-25 08:56 AM] evov#0000
or some of the inputs are priced more expensive on the CX than is needed...


[02-Feb-25 08:57 AM] evov#0000
for example.... BE being priced at 2.2k vs 2k could make the difference between it being highly proffitable vs losing money.

[02-Feb-25 08:59 AM] evov#0000
Like most things at the end of a longish production line - there's a lot of links in the chain. Which link is more/less profitable can change a lot. Looking at the line as a whole is the best option imo.


[02-Feb-25 09:00 AM] jvaler#0000
unless i spin up an ASM base i'm only gonna be interacting with the ~~LI &~~ HCC chains, the rest would be bought off the CX


[02-Feb-25 09:01 AM] jvaler#0000
lemme look


[02-Feb-25 09:01 AM] evov#0000
CBL - for example - If cost of the inputs are 84k - it's more proffitable than IDC's. If cost of inputs are 91k - you're losing money.


[02-Feb-25 09:02 AM] evov#0000
In the scheme of things, it's very reliant on the cost of the input materials.


[02-Feb-25 09:04 AM] jvaler#0000
as far as i can tell the math doesn't work out for it right now


[02-Feb-25 09:05 AM] evov#0000

oh that's almost enough for the current goals

I kind of want to... build up enough stock so I can potentially "sell" a full gate. Because I think that would be cool.

do you plan on pledging these? cause if so i should probably plan on finding something else to do with my phobos base


[02-Feb-25 09:09 AM] moke.#0000
I've got ECAs running SPs now as of about a week ago


[02-Feb-25 09:10 AM] moke.#0000
Planning to donate once I've got my roi covered.


[02-Feb-25 09:10 AM] evov#0000
Depends where things are at when the gate's go live. Pledges are very different to production. And there's a lot of time between now and then.


[02-Feb-25 09:10 AM] jvaler#0000
but you said you have it in hand lol. and 9k is > the current SP deficit


[02-Feb-25 09:11 AM] evov#0000
I intend to have 1 full gate +upgrades on hand when the time comes. I'm working on the pre-cursor bits to the parts that aren't available yet.


[02-Feb-25 09:11 AM] jvaler#0000
okay so your prod isn't related to AGC anyways? .-.


[02-Feb-25 09:12 AM] jvaler#0000
how much per day?


[02-Feb-25 09:14 AM] evov#0000
It will be part of the network yes. Depends on how much cash AGC has if I sell the gate to the AGC, or I "contribute" a full gate for whatever % stake that's worth.

Just as a personal goal, I want to get to the point where I'm in a position to "sell" a full gate... just to be able to say I did it. Since that kinda feels like a "final boss" when it comes to the production side of this game.


[02-Feb-25 09:15 AM] jvaler#0000
okay so it'd be a possible 5th gate to AGC's currently planned 4 gates


[02-Feb-25 09:15 AM] jvaler#0000
gotcha


[02-Feb-25 09:17 AM] jvaler#0000
wait no 4 planned, i read that wrong


[02-Feb-25 09:17 AM] moke.#0000
Off the top of my head i believe I'm doing just under 200 (160-170?) a day right now. But I'm not at my PC to check.


[02-Feb-25 09:17 AM] evov#0000
There's still a lot of time to go. I'm at a point where I've basically produced all the stuff needed for 1 gate and started to shut off those production lines (TSH/RSH/LIT/PSH) etc

So mostly, just keeping an eye out for if there's going to be difficulties in meeting targets on those harder to produce items... if I need to switch those lines back on or not.


[02-Feb-25 09:19 AM] jvaler#0000
hmm okay... i'll wait for archiel's response to my ping

For reference - the green stuff I'm pretty sure you can easily source the volumes needed from the CX. Yellow stuff is stuff the CX won't be able to supply in enough volume. Red isn't available yet.

One of us should check in with allocater's pledge of 10k SP


[02-Feb-25 10:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
SP had sort of been one of the more challenging gateway line items, but it's doing pretty good


[02-Feb-25 10:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
I set up a whole line for dedicated CBL production a while ago, and I find it does pretty well. I like making large amounts of BE because it also makes AL and SIO and it runs pretty fast.


[02-Feb-25 10:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
So I don't think I can give you a hard yes/no on your ECA base, but hopefully that's enough info to help inform your decision


[02-Feb-25 10:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
HCC can be a bottleneck for CBL


[02-Feb-25 11:20 AM] jvaler#0000
hmmm... i think i'm gonna find something else to do with the base. y'all seem to have the SP handled and it'd need way more metallurgy feeding into it than i expected

[23-Feb-25 01:26 AM] pi3142718#0000
Also, looking at the rules of the coop again, as we add more gateways, we add more shares, right? Doesn‚Äôt this dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders?


[23-Feb-25 01:45 AM] jcheung#0000
it also adds to the overall income


[23-Feb-25 01:45 AM] jcheung#0000
it does potentially subsidize the lower performing gates a little bit though if i understand it right


[24-Feb-25 10:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
Correct, more gateways means more shares, but if you own a whole gateway worth of shares, and we add another gateway to the pool, you still have that whole gateway. 

Each gateway we add is expected to improve the value of all the other gateways. A subway with only two stops isn't terribly useful, but each time you add a stop to the end of the subway line, the combinations of potential travel use cases increase drastically. So those original stops become more useful too. I expect that to be the case for gateways.


[24-Feb-25 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have any GF, but that soudns like a great deal for someone who can make the LIT üòÑ

[23-Mar-25 07:18 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
Vortex Fuel. It will be required to operate gateways.


[23-Mar-25 07:42 AM] vanarazor#0000
wow


[23-Mar-25 10:02 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Not at the moment I believe


[23-Mar-25 10:02 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Mostly bc it is not even in the test server


[25-Mar-25 05:16 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I see. I hope you guys will remember me for VF. I would be happy to strike exclusive deals with governments to supply them regularly at fixed competitive rates üôÇ

Hi all.  I'm Zen, newly joined.


[11-Apr-25 12:03 AM] zenwhisper#0000
To recap my inro in the airlock, I have 70% of a base GW gathered, and I'm the largest producer of ES in prepping for the GW consumables.


[11-Apr-25 12:03 AM] jcheung#0000
mind if i ask what upgrades you had planned and where that gate will go?


[11-Apr-25 12:04 AM] jcheung#0000
i'm just curious üòÑ


[11-Apr-25 12:06 AM] zenwhisper#0000
None and none.  I knew having a base gate at the ready would be "helpful".   I know we need to get the core 4 CXs linked first.  I eventually want to get out to the RIM, but realistically I know after the core 4 CXs, if any of the new resource drops are hard to get to, we'll likely need GWs out to them before general expansion.


[11-Apr-25 12:10 AM] jcheung#0000
well, i don't know if you've browsed any of the pinned stuff, but our first gates are planned to BEN via Hekaton üòÑ


[11-Apr-25 12:10 AM] jcheung#0000
i feel like there may have been some other people coordinating a gate from BEN around here somewhere...


[11-Apr-25 12:11 AM] zenwhisper#0000
Considering I run BEN-ANT all of the time I'll be interested in getting that set-up.


[11-Apr-25 12:11 AM] jcheung#0000
ah. here we go. perhaps you'd like to touch base with them too? üòÑ


[11-Apr-25 12:12 AM] zenwhisper#0000

~~we only have 275 people~~


[11-Apr-25 12:37 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
~~Figure of speech~~


[11-Apr-25 12:37 AM] jcheung#0000
as has been demonstrated, there are individual players who are making great efforts to assemble their own personal gates


[11-Apr-25 12:38 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I only know evov


[11-Apr-25 12:38 AM] jcheung#0000
so we'll get the gates one way or another between CXs


[11-Apr-25 12:38 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
And he also has 1.6 billion in equity so not surprising


[11-Apr-25 12:38 AM] jcheung#0000

[11-Apr-25 07:48 PM] jcheung#0000
you mentioned you wanted to get from ANT to BEN first then out to the rim?


[11-Apr-25 07:48 PM] zenwhisper#0000
yup


[11-Apr-25 07:49 PM] jcheung#0000
how many waypoints will that take you?


[11-Apr-25 07:52 PM] zenwhisper#0000
Core to rim is some untold billions to gateway it.  Honestly MOR to HUB is 23 jumps and no one will want to gateway that unless there is an amazing material dropped in the rim


[11-Apr-25 07:54 PM] zenwhisper#0000
So, I'd be happy to get in on the ground floor of getting the core 4 crosslinked.


[11-Apr-25 08:40 PM] evov#0000
I'm in a fairly similar boat of producing / holding onto 1 full gate worth of mats. Their deployment has taken much longer than expected though. So I have since stopped production of all those things.


[14-Apr-25 12:37 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Are you deadset on building out all MAT's yourself?
I've got quite the SP production line going at approx +525/d and could supply you wholesale, if you wanted to talk price

At this point its more of needing a goal than getting to the total.

pretty sure EvoV's gate is from IA-151 -> Antares 1


[30-Apr-25 12:57 AM] evov#0000
Might be at IA-158... since that will allow 5k5k ships to travel between ANT and HRT from that location.


[30-Apr-25 12:57 AM] evov#0000
Ultimately, any gates are useless on their own. The important thing is the network.
