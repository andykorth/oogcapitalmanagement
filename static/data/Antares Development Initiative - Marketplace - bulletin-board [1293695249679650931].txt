I've recently hit ₳40,000,000 liquid, so I'm officializing the unofficial jvaler loans I'd been giving out.

I am now offering loans to all ADI members!
I will be matching the interest rate of the Bank of Lowstrife at 3% weekly, although any and all terms of the loans are negotiable to fit your circumstance.

Are you a new player? Are you just a sucker for good deals? 

I'm here to give out free bases and upgrades for new players. I run a vast crimi-... very legal and very cool empi... enterprise! and its gotten to the point where a new permit for me costs the same as 25 for you. No joke. But the needs of raw and midtier resources never end, so I'm giving out free ship upgrades and bases in exchange for reliable suppliers at reliable prices. DM me if you are interested!

So. Burn need you 🫵. Yes right you. We currently need and looking for 3 bases. 

Life (ZV-896c)          21 HYF-HCP
Nascent (QJ-149)   31 INC-C  
^^^That one need to be build first^^^

Boucher(FK-794b) 35 RIG-H2O


Both Nascent and Boucher base fits in AGP 1m cost so you will get free base plus some consumables, for that exact base. 

And now about BURN itself. How it works. We have guys who mine water. Project lead (Me) ship it to Life or Harmonia where that water is turned into Green stuff. Then they again give it to me to ship it to Nascent, where is imperfect greens turned into tasty carbon. Everything again send to me for split. Split happens every week or two. I will start thread where i post screenshots and stuff. 

And where you can ask questtions.
