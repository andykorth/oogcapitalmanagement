Appreciate the cheap price, but don’t feel bad having folks pitch in for fuel and repairs!


[15-Sep-22 05:15 PM] emperyan11#0000
They won't always be Haiku Runs...


[15-Sep-22 05:18 PM] emperyan11#0000
😀


[17-Sep-22 12:43 AM] emperyan11#0000
Heading to Deimos to unload and parts beyond from there.


[17-Sep-22 12:43 AM] emperyan11#0000
Suggestions?


[19-Sep-22 09:09 AM] rune_242#0000
demeter to YK-649b
or harmonia YK


[19-Sep-22 06:53 PM] emperyan11#0000
Will head to Demeter from ANT tonight and the on to YK-649b
Set your orders.


[19-Sep-22 10:51 PM] emperyan11#0000
Seeing nothing at Demeter, I will head to 649b direct, if there are any orders...


[19-Sep-22 10:52 PM] churavis#0000
I can fill the ship Demeter to YK-649b all on my own


[19-Sep-22 10:53 PM] emperyan11#0000
I'll head to Demeter then...


[19-Sep-22 10:54 PM] churavis#0000
This is a 2k/2k ship, right?


[19-Sep-22 10:55 PM] emperyan11#0000
Correct

ANT CX is next. Will take suggestions for stops on the way and destinations after!


[22-Sep-22 10:42 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I have been wanting to do a trip with my 2000 from QJ-382g to bring H to the BMPs on Heph - but I keep pushing it down the priority list. Maybe you could make the run for me? Let me know!


[22-Sep-22 10:45 AM] emperyan11#0000
I could do that after my supply run for sure!


[22-Sep-22 11:09 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, just let me know when and I'll post a sell ad! Cheers


[22-Sep-22 11:15 AM] emperyan11#0000
Will do


[25-Sep-22 10:45 PM] emperyan11#0000
Supply run all done, if you want to set up the shipping order I can make the flight


[26-Sep-22 12:56 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Sent you a contract, thanks! Turns out Heph WAR can only hold 1000 capacity so the shipment will go to Phobos and I'll figure out how to get it from there


[26-Sep-22 07:16 PM] emperyan11#0000
@yjhasaday Should be on site tomorrow afternoon for pick up.

[28-Sep-22 03:58 PM] emperyan11#0000
Delivered. As I mentioned in game. If you want to break that shipment up into two 1k or smaller ones for delivery to HEPH let me know. I'll shift them for 1 AIC


[28-Sep-22 10:07 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Thank you! Sent you a contract, going to try and sell it from mobile once it lands on Heph (I'm away for the next week)


[28-Sep-22 11:32 PM] emperyan11#0000
No worries, I'll get it underway soon


[29-Sep-22 05:18 PM] emperyan11#0000
Soon as you fulfil, I can fly


[07-Oct-22 08:43 PM] emperyan11#0000
Traveling to ANT >>Deimos  in a couple hours. Loads of room.


[07-Oct-22 09:10 PM] churavis#0000
One full load posted


[07-Oct-22 09:16 PM] exeler#0000
I also posted a bunch, based on what was accepted I'm pretty sure the boat is full now 😅


[07-Oct-22 09:25 PM] emperyan11#0000
Sure is. I'm sending another ship from Deimos to clean up. Fortunately, they were scheduled to go already 🤣


[07-Oct-22 09:26 PM] exeler#0000
Nice, that's all of them then. Time to buy more junk and fill my ANT warehouse again 😅


[07-Oct-22 09:27 PM] emperyan11#0000
Happy to help!
