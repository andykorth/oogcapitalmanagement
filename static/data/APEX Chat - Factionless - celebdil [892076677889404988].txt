[27-Sep-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Anyone want to ship anything to Moria CX?


[27-Sep-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've got 400/400 free space and will be heading out before too long.


[27-Sep-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	8 NCC per max.


[27-Sep-21 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	why does this always happen after I just panic sent my ship(s) here ;)


[27-Sep-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Leaving now.


[28-Sep-21 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Hello! I'm a relatively new player and not all that familiar with how population works yet so apologies if this is a dumb question. If you have open jobs do those only fill on Wednesdays when the populations update?


[28-Sep-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Normally yes. We had a safety problem for awhile so lost population. Your pioneer jobs will probably fill. Settler growth can be slow.


[28-Sep-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Oh I see, thanks for the info!


[29-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	Somehow I am short 1 HB1... dang it!


[29-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Safety station running at nearly 100% gave us 100% safety.


[29-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	We got a ton of new pioneers, big success there.


[29-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yup, that report looked good


[29-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Though not enough for the insane amount of pioneer jobs people are apparently throwing down.


[29-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Hmm, 3 pioneers available for work.


[29-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So apparently they did cover all the open jobs!


[29-Sep-21 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	feeling a bit shorted on the settler part though :( is it time for an INF?


[29-Sep-21 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I was only missing a couple of settlers but fully staffed agian now/


[29-Sep-21 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	That was a great population update for us


[29-Sep-21 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Well it's not just Montem players but now Montem pioneers who have moved here.


[29-Sep-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	While it seems like it should be the case, I don't actually think workers migrate from one planet to another.


[29-Sep-21 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Migration is just growth on or off of one population tier.


[29-Sep-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I'm just moaning... I'll try to stop finding an excuse to complain about it in every planet chat.


[29-Sep-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I can moan about it on 2 planets as well at least ;)


[30-Sep-21 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	50 office supplies up on LM.


[30-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Aaaaand 50 more.


[30-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	btw, does anyone have a couple BDEs on hand they could spare me in the next 40 minutes?


[30-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	close but I just saw it now ;)


[30-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I just missed that and a BDE went into production.  Isn't the end of the world though.


[30-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	ah too bad. well you could cancel the order and maybe loose only 1 PG?


[30-Sep-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	3, but good shout.


[30-Sep-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Yes I've BDE


[30-Sep-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Seems like I'm a bit ate though


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Looks like an INF would be useful for those who want settler / techs


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Mainly settlers.


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	btw, I decided to finish up my OFF quickly, since I'm running out of pro in a few days and do not intend to renew.


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I'm willing to put up buy ads


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I actually expect to be quitting the game entirely not long after pro runs out.


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Not because of that, but because the game isn't fun anymore.


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Azorth**:	Quitting or taking a break?


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Break is my hope.  I might come back after a universe reset.


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'd be very interested in being able to setup new hubs (CXs) and eploring the universe.


[01-Oct-21 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	This universe doesn't have many places worth expanding to away from the ring.


[01-Oct-21 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	there might be some incentive coming soon, but yes, there are no real arguments against that :/


[02-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	What's the price of Trusses on Celeb right now?


[02-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm thinking I'm going to get the lv 6 HQ upgrade before my pro runs out.


[02-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	So I need 64.


[02-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	245 a unit. I can fill a buy for 64


[02-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I can do that.


[02-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Safety uniforms up on LM.


[02-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	If people want to contribute to the safety station with those.


[02-Oct-21 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	done ;)


[03-Oct-21 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I don't suppose anyone has 19 BDEs?


[03-Oct-21 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I forgot that not all of my bids had been filled and sent my ship too early.


[03-Oct-21 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	If someone can fill that within 1.5 hours, I won't have to go back home.


[03-Oct-21 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	sorry got only a single one left from last repairs


[03-Oct-21 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Killed the ad.


[03-Oct-21 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I don't know if my ads will stick around after pro runs out, but I've got both types of fuel now on the LM for those who skip the CX while shipping your stuff around.


[03-Oct-21 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	The LM will be quite dull without you. I carry a few BDE here but did not have enough to sort you out yesterday btw.


[04-Oct-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Looks like the LM ads don't disappear after pro runs out.


[04-Oct-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I just can't post anymore.


[05-Oct-21 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
***stiles** joined.*


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Real quick does anyone have any shipments they want brought from the CX here?


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've 100 tonnage and 25 volume left.


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	250* volume


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Minimum 50 NCC payment, 5 per t.


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Alright, heading out.


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Twilight can I get a quote on 41 OFF? I need it for HQ upgrade


[05-Oct-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I'll just get in line too ;)


[06-Oct-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm not making any at the moment.


[06-Oct-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I did bring in a little extra CL for my own use, once the contest starts, but I also only have one BMP here.


[06-Oct-21 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Hey I gained 3 techs, so that wasn't too bad.


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've got 20 SUN that I can sell to people, but you'll have to post the buys yourself.  280 NCC/u.


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I also still have more FF, 11/u.


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'll also be able to sell some off in ~20 hours.


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	OFF*


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I'll buy 41, so just let me know when and price and I'll buy it off you


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	No one's going to post buy ads for SUN?


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The OFF is still 47.6/u.  Since ads are free you may as well post and I can accept it when the OFF is done.


[07-Oct-21 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	They'll be a bit delayed as I made a mistake when restructuring my base.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Phew, there, hab problem fixed.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Thanks Twilight


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'll have 59 OFF I can sell in 2 hours.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I still have that SUN too.  Anyone who wants to contribute to the SST can buy that.  We need at least 10 contributed in the next few days.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Still 280/u.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	oh your quick lol


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Just chance there.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm quickly checking the LMs before turning the game off.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Seeing if people want to buy OFF, SUN, fuel, or settler consumables here.


[08-Oct-21 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	And SF or KOM on Montem.


[09-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	@aeryen Did you also need OFF still?


[09-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	(I've got another batch of EPO on the way, so I'll be able to make another 150 OFF once that's done.)


[09-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I still have 59 right now.


[09-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	got some from CX but might as well get some here and put a bit into POPI as well


[09-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	ad is up, thanks


[09-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	also my ship is getting here in ~1h and immediately retuning to montem, I could probably fit in some small hand baggage ;)


[09-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Done.  SUN and OFF are out of stock now.


[10-Oct-21 06:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	OFF back in stock, I've got 100 units now, and can make another 50 later.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Heading to the CX in a bit with quite a bit of space leftover if someone wants to send shipping with me.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	290 t, 340 m3.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	8/max is fine.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Ad posted


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Okay, leaving now.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm interested in buying 10 trusses, if someone can post a sell ad for them.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	10% discount if you buy 300 :)


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Thank you.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	200t/m3 available from MOR -> here if anyone is interested. leaving in 15 min


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	left


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jorre**:	Got buys up for some buys for emergency consumables for a hefty price.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Good to know I'm not the only one out of food.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'd planned on waiting some time until my next trip here, but my base is hitting 90 days old today.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm going to need to do some repairs.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	fyi if you're looking for more techs we're gonna need the INF


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Just throwing that out there for those using them


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I gianed 6 more this week.  I'm fine as things are.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've got a batch of 20 SUN that I can sell on the LM.  280/u.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The SST will need to get those supplied in a 1.6 days.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	10 are gone.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I donated the 10 SUN myself.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The other 10 SUN.


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	omg, what have you done


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	Capitalism


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	I take it SNF as a whole has funded this?


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	as long as we don't make an ADM here


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	so far there isn't any talk that I can see in our chat's


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	No ADM, We wouldn't do something like that without asking if it is wanted first lol


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	What the hell!?


[22-Oct-21 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Now I wonder just how much backroom dealing is going on for the planet.  I'd assumed most people didn't care since I was the only one doing regular talking about the infrastructure and situation on the planet.


[22-Oct-21 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm baaaaaack


[22-Oct-21 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Backroom dealing = Rek writing a 100 word message in discord suggesting we get this done. This is a good planet if you need lfabs. Good to see you back on the LM.


[22-Oct-21 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	nice. I thought about suggesting building cogc, but always forgot to mention it lol


[22-Oct-21 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Doing Montem to here in 2 hours if anyone needs stuff moved.


[05-Nov-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Oh, I've got OFF!


[05-Nov-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I needs to be supplied in the next day or two.


[05-Nov-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I also have SUN, which is needed in 5.5 days.


[05-Nov-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	One sec while I check prices.


[05-Nov-21 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Ads are up for those who want to contribute.


[05-Nov-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	oh, I would take 46 OFF as well for my HQ twilight if you got enough, Just let me know the price


[05-Nov-21 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You'll need to wait until the next run is done.  I'll be selling at the same rate as the rest of the OFF.


[05-Nov-21 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	ok, can do


[05-Nov-21 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'll bump it to the top of the list so it's ready tomorrow.


[12-Nov-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I should have posted earlier, but I'll need 10 BHP in 24 hours.


[12-Nov-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	What's the current price?


[12-Nov-21 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Let me know if my price is unacceptable.


[12-Nov-21 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've started selling tubes for contributing to the infirmary.


[12-Nov-21 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Thank you for the hull plates.


[12-Nov-21 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	np :)


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm buying two trusses.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Thank you.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	My SCN ran out sooner than I thought.  If someone has a spare on hand, I'll buy it at a premium.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	oh man, looks like I need one as well now lol, must of just consumed my last one with this PoPR


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've got one sitting at the CX, but my ship is still 2 days out from Outer Heaven and I need to send it elsewhere first.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I should just set a shipping request.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	SUN's up on the LM if you want to supply the SST.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	And it's all gone.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	Should just do it in batches of 30 next time :P


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Ads are free here.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	And I'd intended for multiple people to supply.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	No one ever shipped my SCN, so I'm doing it myself.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Got it.


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Let's try shipping from the CX again, maybe someone will actually pick this up this time?


[12-Nov-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	in general, it would be easier for me at least to ship from e.g. montem


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I'll be doing Montem to here in a few hours. Could bring small shipments with me.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've got a glass STL ship in Moria, so all of my out of system shipping is done from the CX.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Plus the stuff I'm trying to ship I don't make at Montem.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	well not everyone has an STL ship ;)


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'll be donating the needed BTAs for the INF fairly soon.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	In case anyone else wants to help contribute.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	TUB and OFF are no problem for me to keep it running.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I won't be making any STR, they take too long to make.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	And we probably wouldn't need it anyway.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Let's try shipping from Montem then.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	17 trusses please, what's the price?


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	We're down to just 12 BDEs on the hospital.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Well I had 13 BDE, so why not.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	225 for TRUs and Thanks Aeryen for shipping 200 of them to Montem.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I need to get my supplies straight :/ so just happened to have a half full ship returning ;)


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	ah crap, just noticed I need some BHP ^^ somebody producing them here? (but of course I noticed after sending the ship off...)


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cvelle**:	yup, @Rek is producing them here. I've pinged him on discord


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Ad up.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm thinking of making a new hull welding plant.  I need a lot of AL built up though.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	It won't be for awhile since my ships are in OH at the moment.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	However as my Mule is under 81% hull condition and there's no BHP available to buy, there's a strong chance I'll build it if no one starts selling soon.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	@TwilightSentinel, I can sell you BHP here - let me know how much you'd like :)


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rek**:	I've got 27u on-hand, minus whatever @aeryen would like. And I can switch back from LHP if you need more.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	heh, had the same idea about building the plant, twilight, but it'd be a shame to run it only for a few days


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	one of my ships is down to 77.7% oO, I'm not sure, I am noticing any slowdowns though


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I'm buy my BHP's from Rek here, then every time I forget to repair the ship, by the time it comes back it needs more to repair and I don't have enough. The BHP piles higher, the ship gets shabbier.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	I really did not expect all usual kinds of logistics trouble when I planned my base here (was the second one, so not that much experience ;)), so I still don't have a STO here - always juggling like crazy


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I nearly bult a 3rd STO on Vallis :)


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Someone assigned their OFF to the infirmery instead of the SST, so we need more OFF for that.  I do have some and am posting on the LM shortly.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've got 2 ships worth and a bit of LHP on Moria CX.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Had it for months, no ones's ever bought for their own glass ship.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Always done it in corp or made it themselves.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'll pick up 10-11 BHP for my Mule when it's coming to Celebdil next.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	OFF up.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'm full up on techs now.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I still need 14


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	We don't quite have enough OFF donated for the next SST period.  I've also put up a bunch more OFF ads since I made a bunch more.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I can make some MCG if no one has any being shipped in.  It will be ready tomorrow.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Oh never mind.


[12-Nov-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I'll keep saving the SIO for my glass forge then.

[29-Nov-21 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	For the exact purpose of letting people buy AL and ALO.


[29-Nov-21 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vel**:	I thought so too for some reason


[03-Dec-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	We nearly ran out of OFF for the infirmary.  So I donated some myself.


[03-Dec-21 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Also I'm sorry I slipped up on SUN, we missed the last upkeep for that entirely.


[04-Dec-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	The infirmary needs OFF, there's still enough available for the next cycle on the LM.


[04-Dec-21 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Dec-21 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	yeah but in that case CoGC specialization is better


[29-Mar-22 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	if you have two bases, it's better to give one +25% boost than both of them +10% each


[29-Mar-22 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	but you need 3 of them, and then you need to do this awkward dance with the programs


[29-Mar-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	we settled on +10% for everyone being the best we can do a while ago


[29-Mar-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Mar-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Mar-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

We can vote 1 week extraction, the next metallurgy and keep alternating between the two. This way the smelters will be well supplied and very busy. :)

**purpdrag**:	I am still somewhat new to the game so still poor most of the time.  Started producing a little OFF over on Vallis and will start bringing in at least 50/week.  I could also make SUN every now and again instead if needed, but it takes time to get the spare inputs, make the OFF or SUN, and then ship from Vallis to here on my next run.

**purpdrag**:	At 93 days you are probably still trying to grow and every BSE matters to you.  So basically no one would expect you to contribute much at this point.  Some token contributions of maybe 30 DW or 50 or 100 MCG a week would actually help though and also show your involvement.  The infrastructure is still relatively low level here, so upkeep costs are also relatively low and even small contributions help.  Take a look at the details on the pop infrastructure and the COGC to plan what you might be able to contribute in the future.


[19-Mar-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Building a second INF should be the next target after the Park, we are max out on contributions but only achieving 50 of demand .  Increasing the number of INF increases the max contributions


[19-Mar-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	If anyone can spare a few Bfabs this will help


[19-Mar-23 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I also thought raising INF to level 2 would be a good next step after the Wildlife Park, with Health now down to 88% on the last pop report.


[19-Mar-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I am assuming that as the pop goes up we will need higher level facilities to maintain the same levels of Safety, Health, etc.


[19-Mar-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	That how it works, think of it like the consumables that you give to your workers.  If you don’t give them all they want their effeciency/happiness drops


[19-Mar-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I still never have "spare" Bfabs, and don't store any on Celebdil, but I will see if I can bring a few extra on my next trip, which will probably be in 4 or 5 days.


[19-Mar-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	my main production is pefabs, a few more days and I can bring prefabs for the infirmary upgrade, I only ask that someone bring MCG and TRU, I do not produce these materials


[19-Mar-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	TRU is easy, I produce on site now, but usually those are filled already when I look.  I can also sometimes bring in MCG, although again, I never store "extra" MCG here.  Only enough for each new build package.


[19-Mar-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	Tks @purpdrag, we also need MCG for COGC upkeep!!


[19-Mar-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marshmallows72**:	happy to contribute in anyway


[19-Mar-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marshmallows72**:	Got 120 MCG what contribute


[19-Mar-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I'll try to bring in excess MCG when I bring in the ADM/PAR parts, I have plenty at Danakil


[19-Mar-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Marsh, please dont worry the best you can do is advertise when you are bringing a ship in with cargo space so that we can get items moved in.  Assuming that you are mainly going to be doing a Danakil to Celebdil run then I can supply you goods at Danakil to move over


[19-Mar-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**marshmallows72**:	Oreyt pal will do


[20-Mar-23 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	anybody got some spare ALO to sell?


[20-Mar-23 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I’ve a bit, 40 units


[20-Mar-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I'm afraid I need it in the 1000s


[20-Mar-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	thought you might need a little more than I had to offer


[20-Mar-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	if ALO supply on world is actually a need then I'm happy to ramp up my extraction.  I'm here for the Metallurgy bonus rather than the ALO and so I've got alot of space available


[20-Mar-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I've not got the shipping capacity to support ALO production here so if someone would buy direct on planet, I would build the infrastructure

[20-Mar-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	you're welcome.  Whilst I suspect most people will want more Pioneers to feed those EXT/SME combos, if a few weeks of Tech recruitment could be considered it will help my plans


[20-Mar-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	The Wildlife Park was a good start for Techs


[20-Mar-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I am also set up to produce just enough ALO to feed the SMEs.  My surplus ALO is literally about 10/week right now and that's only because I running with 3 RE experts.  Once I get a 4th Metallurgy expert I'm going to need yet another EXT just to be able to use all 4 of them.

**Dr.Eggman**:	i have 52 on hand and am making upto 20/day


[04-May-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I did the exact same thing here.  Had to shut it down after a few weeks.  I couldn't move all those hull plates either.


[05-May-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	ya i think im going to switch to the RHP and save them for when i upgrade my ships


[05-May-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Same, except I went with LHPs, did enough for an upgrade, a ship build, and some future repairs.  I moved it all to Vallis over time and still have a stockpile there for an upcoming ship build.  I actually recently started a new HWP on Vallis using AL from here.  That also will be temporary.  Probably a few more days and done.


[05-May-23 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	ya its crazy how fast it goes. what made you choose light hull plate? when i was looking at the differences it seemed that the biggest was the damage reductions


[05-May-23 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	which is why im leaning towards RHP


[05-May-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	it was msotly due to discussion in global chat with Zuul and lowstrife and that travel times/fuel costs are noticeably reduced by the lighter weight.  The faster wear is also I think more than offset by the cheaper cost of the LHPs for repair, but faster travel times for same fuel is the main reason.


[06-May-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	thanks for the info :)

[10-May-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	warehouse it's the next upgrade I'm working on. I'll probably finish it next week.


[12-May-23 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i wonder how everyone is utilizing Celebdil at the moment. Just to see how far it makes sense to develop the planet. I am just running EXTs here at the moment and ship the ALO where I need it. So my needs are basically just PIOs and later probably just a HWP so a hand ful of TEC / ENGs


[12-May-23 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I adjust my plans to the population.  I would have planned one or two higher level facilities here except there were n Engineers and Scientists.  No big deal though and I don't really like to redo my bases much.  The main purpose here is to extract and smelt AL, so that's all PIOs anyway.  So for me the current pop structure is good.  We are now running a fairly high unemployment so the best thing for the pop now is more jobs while maintaining the same facility levels.


[12-May-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	For now the infrastructures are good, we don't need to upgrade because we have a lot of unemployment and that reduces happiness!


[12-May-23 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	maybe in a few weeks we'll need some culture, but for now it's good


[12-May-23 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DocSpeaker**:	next project is warehouse upgrade!


[12-May-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ok. just wanted to check what's the general direction we want to go. if the majority says PIOs are fine I'm good. The 2nd question would be if we want to prefer shifting the CoGC to Extraction, since extracting and smelting on the same planet with 500 area constraint is more efficient with Extraction focus EXT uses 31 area, SME uses 22


[12-May-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	EXT CoGC + 5 EXT experts = 4 EXT : 12 SMEs vs 6 EXT : 11 SME


[12-May-23 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	something in that direction at least. i am also accounting for a HWP


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spaceballs**:	PIO is good with me. I’d prefer to keep smelting cogc but not gonna riot if you change to ext


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I could have built to work with Resource Extraction but since it is Metallurgy I built to fit that.  Metallurgy would have been my preference here even if it was something else.  I will continue to vote Metallurgy for now at least.


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	PIOs would be interesting too but I would come out behind on that too since I am heavy on the SMEs here.


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so you guys are not extracting here and ship your stuff to smelt here?


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	hmm ok, i ran both options in prunner again and i see what you mean.


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I extract and smelt.  My current ratio or 5 EXT:8 SME is balanced for CoGC Metallurgy.


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	although I may add another SME and occasionally bring in some FEO or TIO


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	7 EXT 9 SME on metallurgy produces 99 AL /d on 468 area and 3 EXT 12 SME produces 85 AL /d on resource extraction


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i never thought that this makes that much of a difference over using the area less efficiently


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	*4 EXT 12 SME . typo there


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	actually good point, my 5:8 setup can't keep up with the SMEs unless the Experts a balanced, so all Metallurgy experts would need another EXT


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	although i still couldn't figure out how to make most use of the space we have since you'll mostly end up with a 2 digit area left over


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	or you need to have homeless pioneers


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	currently I am running 4 Metallurgy experts (the 5th takes a REALLY long time to get) and occasionally bringing in supplemental ore, or I can tweak the experts, etierh way


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	atm i have only EXTs running on celebdil. I can pack more ALO on a ship than AL.. and I need the AL on vallis, where i have a smelter array anyway


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that got tricky and I am not using all my space here yet, but that is where filling in some other buildings can work, like WEL, PP2, HWP, or even POL or PPF


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I currently have 34 space left, could just do another hab and one small building


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	my current plan on metallurgy CoGC : 1 metallurgy expert, 5 extraction experts, 8 EXT, 6 SME, 1 HWP. so the HWP is using all the locally produced AL and refines it into the lighter hull plates and the ALO which is not used locally goes to Vallis for LParts


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i have 33 space left with this setup. but can't find anything interesting to do with it :/


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	feeding the HWP took about 4 or 5 SMEs all by itself and the problem turned out to be moving the hull plates so I eventually shut it down after a few weeks


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's just plain stupid that you can fit less AL on a ship than ALO xD


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so refining locally doesnt make sense for me


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	did it again later though, it is one of the few buildings I have built while already planning to demolish it after a while.


[12-May-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so shipping ALO = 246 worth of AL fits on the ship. VS 185 AL after refining xD


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	regarding local smelting, I just like to do it that way.  For max profit you could have a planet dedicated to each but I didn't set it up that way.  I even like to then use some of the AL on site and not even carry that.


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	but I mostly export now that there is no HWP


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah that'S what i'm planning. I leave FE smelting to the newbs since it's not really carrying any profits. which means my starter base is mainly producing AL, AST and FET


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I recently started producing/selling AST/FET and am disappointed by the ability to sell it.  Thank goodness for BeBopLua for giving me my first legit sale of those.


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	all the ALO that i can't use on vallis will be smelted to AL on celebdil then refined to LHPs. so i can fit 100 LHPs = 1200 AL on a small ship . there might be better strategies but that's the best i could come up with :/


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I also sell within my Corp for no profit, basically taking a loss on those


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	100 LHPs on small ship is where the calc goes all wrong


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	our corp really thought about starting projects where GTU is bottlenecking.. then again i think we dropped it, because we weren't sure how much profit we could make there


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	only 50 can fit on starter


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ah yeah i forgot about volume


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	True, but that AL also includes C, O and to a lesser extent FLX.  If you SME here C,O and flx comes in with your transport and AL goes out.  Ship to Vallis and a near empty ship arrives and you have to ship the c,o to Vallis.  QED, sme here is better


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	but 50 LHPs is still 600 AL xD


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	well that's where havng a corp is fun


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	and of course you already have other stuff to carry so I couldn't move out/sell all those hull plates.  I have bigger ships now but actually works better now to carry the AL to Vallis and have the HWP there.


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yes i fly mostly empty from vallis to celebdil. but i don't have to take care about C logistics. since i buy it from a corpmate who delivers his C there for us to use


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	sometimes the hull plates were slow to sell too and low profit but BHPs have been good lately


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i don't even think i'll sell the LHPs outside of the corp. at least not in the beginning. we have ships to upgrade and then do occasional repairs


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and even then, if i overproduce, i can just demolish for a while


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	IMHO, we are universally building too many Hull plates and not enough FLT/SLT drives and LIS


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the whole ship business is an incredibly slow market since it needs shittons of NCC


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I think hull plates is a great Metallurgy activity, it is a good plan, just be ready they come out fast and take a lot of space


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	so in this case it does make sense to run for a few weeks and take some loss on the materials but not too much since it isn't terribly expensive to build


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i heard the bottleneck is actually command bridges and crew quarters


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	im thinking of scrapping my hwp wonce i have the plates stockpiled for an upgrade. then put in an asm to support my shipkit factory


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	it is blackheart those two are brutal to self make


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah but even the SKF cant print unlimited stuff.. i actually thought abouzt building my own STL only GEN ship. just for MOR-Vallis roundtrips


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	That’s the LIS part, bridges are easy


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that was the bottleneck in GTU but they have been cranking out lately and engines seem to be the last thing now but overall I think balanced fairly well just a lot of demand now


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	but even going cheap ass like that takes a lot of money


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	The SKF takes ridiculous amount of input to keep running continuously


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah

**Dr.Eggman**:	hey purpdragon what does a wcb upgrade pack cost from you guys these days?


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	SKFs are too fast for their own good


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i did the math.


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's cheaper to build the SKF. build the parts you need. then demolish it again


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	im making good use of mine running the titanium fuel tanks


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I think about 500k


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	selling for 50k ea on moria


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I run a SKF 24/7


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you must have quite the production chain then


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	who would i reach out to to buy one? hitting severe weight limits while trying toi acheive our own in-corp upgrading


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	does also depend on what you are making but even the non AST/FET stuff takes a lot of inputs


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and i know for sure . i couldn't sell the shit from it before i go bankrupt from the bound liquidity / running costs


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	thats why im running the titanium recipie its only an investment of tio on my end


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Shipbuilding leader seems to be MadMonk21, LazySiege very involved too.


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	kk thanks :)


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah but what apart from shipbuilding can metallurgists really do?


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	send one of them a DM but actually BeBopLua can answer better probably


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	oh nevermind he is not GTU


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	yes just do that


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	sadly, just producing and selling metals makes me more money than ship parts


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	because shipbuilding does seem like the natural higher level specialty for Matallurgy


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	ignore my typos


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	some things are really weird in this game... like i run 2 GFs and can produce enough TUBs to solely run celebdil upkeep with it xD


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and even parially vallis


[12-May-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	and some products are used in huge volumes and others is super tiny volumes


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	tcl is one of the most brutal constraints in that reguard


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dr.Eggman**:	so slow/expencive to make so fast to use


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I can build a WCB for 450k, currently have LCB running, then a contracted WCB, would probably have to run a Med fuel tank next to build back allloys then could run another WCB


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	@BeBopLua I have small excess production after corp supply if you want to set up a deal I would do direct contracts on Vallis for 1600 each and could do about 40AST+40FET every 5-7 days


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	as you noticed I have been putting it up on CX for 1800 each and it mostly just sits there


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i'm also in the TCL business.. but the market isn't as profitable anymore.. i am cursed.. every market i join crashes soon after xD


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	maybe i should make that a business model.


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@BeBopLula is your SKF running on Vallis?


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I run electronics on Vallis


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	Where is the SKF?


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	because i'm producing AST / FET for my own WCB upgrade and renting some SKF would be nicer for me than building my own SKF. but shipping all the shit off planet .. yeah no xD


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	280d, TIO world with metallurgy


[12-May-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I shift in AL and FE, SME TI, alloys then cargo bays.  All on one world

[19-Jun-23 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@BlackAnthrax the current governor is active but is running this operation at their own pace, you'll get a reply sooner or later, I have faith in @TheEnvoy.


[19-Jun-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(especially since you can tell that they have contributed to multiple POPI projects just a day ago, which is within the two-day timeframe of contract offers expiring, which may or may not indicate that they're currently busy irl)

**Vashulda**:	Ore? Whats your offer?


[24-Jun-23 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	smelted aluminium


[24-Jun-23 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	unfortunately all AL that i smelt evaporates as soon as it leaves the SME :D


[27-Jun-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Sep-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I joined when I planned an AL base here and left when I realised I couldn't produce enough to match my demand of 4500+ AL/week


[04-Sep-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	right now this base is being used for something else


[04-Sep-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you'd need at least 2 bases for that kind of throughput. celebdil full with extractors and 1-2 other planets with SMEs


[04-Sep-23 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	I do exactly that with Celebdil and Vallis. ~3500 AL /w


[12-Sep-23 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-23 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Sep-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BlackAnthrax**:	for me it's better that way, so i don't complain :D


[02-Nov-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Daegon616**:	Indeed, with higher extraction I can run more smelters and produce more AL per day compared to having metallurgy, according to my pruner website calculations anyway


[04-Nov-23 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	exactly. with ResExt you can support almost a 1000 area SME array.

I also want to wish success to all new participants in election races - governors or parliamentarians. In my turn, I step down as governor with the hope that this beautiful planet will continue its movement for betterment. Dig! :)

**--SCHAITR--**:	Latest POPR shows we're going according to plan - PIO and SET bubbles are being reduced. We may run TEC immigration for a week to offset the TEC losses, but it's still important to reduce the PIO/SET bubbles to reduce overall upkeep costs.


[07-Aug-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	So far, only one person has informed me that they're using 10 TEC so I'm not placing TECs high in my priority

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Welcome to Dwarf World - we dig dig dig the ALO!


[24-Sep-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I would like to expand the base here to 500 area, but I won't be able to ship that many ALO to CX - could I rely on an LM instead? Is the demand sufficient, or would I have to underprice severely?


[24-Sep-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Dig. This is the way.


[24-Sep-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I occasionally need some additional ALO. Not too much, but you'd have a customer in me every once in a while.


[24-Sep-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Really though, I'd recommend turning the stuff into AL yourself. Far better profits. Put down a couple SMEs if you ask me.


[24-Sep-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Filefolders**:	What sort of pricing do you have in mind?


[24-Sep-24 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I'll price as low as it's needed to sell it all here. The question is "is it viable to sell all the ALO here, and (almost) never ship it?"


[26-Sep-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Shoot, I messed up my bases lol. For some reason I thought this was the Giedi Prime chat, where I have another AL base lol.


[26-Sep-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But the fundamentals remain the same imo. Making AL is better than making ALO if you can.
