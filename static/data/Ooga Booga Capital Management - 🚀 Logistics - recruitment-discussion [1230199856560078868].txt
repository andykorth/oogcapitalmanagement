Pinned a message.


[17-Apr-24 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
Anyway - wanted to put forward two names for an invite: Hal98 | FREM and Uncle_Leslie69 | IRA. Both are >90 days and pretty active in the ADI discord. They buy and sell a lot there, and help out a lot of the newer players that join. All antares bases, too.

[17-Apr-24 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
I noticed that Uncle_Leslie69 is in a two-person corp, but they may still want to join without hopping in the in-game corp


[17-Apr-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think they both look great. `SecretAce` is the other one in Uncle Leslie's corp . I don't see any other particular red flags on them, although maybe a bit less active


[17-Apr-24 12:14 PM] churavis#0000
I think we should be more vague in our publicly posted candidates. For example, instead of "80% of bases in Antares sphere of influence" we should say "Majority Antares Bases"

This will give us more flexibility and also prevent anyone from trying to do stuff just to get into the corp


[17-Apr-24 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
The stuff under the ------ line is intended for our use only.

Not sure about the pro license, maybe we should move it to nice to have. Since some members currently don't have one (i.e. me 🙈)

{Reactions}
🤨 

[17-Apr-24 02:46 PM] zipatsu#0000
Maybe just Basic so that they're able to receive and accept contracts at least?


[17-Apr-24 02:46 PM] exeler#0000
Maybe say pro or basic preferred?

Hard to coordinate with someone who can't send or receive contravts


[17-Apr-24 02:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I forgot about basic, mentioning that might help. I think as long as one side of the transaction has pro it’s fine. If we get a lot of people without pro it will get rough to conduct trades. I wouldn’t remove a good member who lost pro. So maybe publicly strongly encourage it but be flexible on an individual basis?


[17-Apr-24 04:22 PM] churavis#0000
The purpose of requiring pro is to make sure that the player has committed to playing for a while and isn't going to just drop off right away. Those who only somewhat enjoy this very niche game aren't going to keep buying pro, plus the inconveniences of not having pro will push them away as well.

This obviously doesn't apply to current members who don't have a license but are still playing.


[17-Apr-24 04:22 PM] churavis#0000
More broadly, there's no reason why we would have to apply new recruiting standards to current members.


[18-Apr-24 08:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
Agreed with Churavis, requirement should be pro to come in, but of course you'd drop to basic in here without too much issue.


[18-Apr-24 08:21 AM] churavis#0000
We can't have too many players on basic as that makes it harder to trade between corp players


[18-Apr-24 08:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, true, I think most people who drop would end up dropping the game entirely. melon and allocator are the special ones 😛

Yeah, game ux is pretty tiring atm, to many clicks and typing needed. Not enough automation/templating


[18-Apr-24 09:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
There was some discussion yesterday that suggested molp would be okay with some sort of multi-buy tool. It's okay if it fills out buffers, as long as it doesn't submit them. It's okay if it opens a few buffers, just not a ton of them.

Bulk item transfer would be nice. Like trasfer all items to fulfill a burn of a specific base

[18-Apr-24 09:34 AM] churavis#0000
So someone could conceivably make a tool that adds a button to make your buy or sell price whatever needed to make the sale go through immediately?


[18-Apr-24 09:35 AM] mrsmith33#0000
there is already such a button

[18-Apr-24 09:36 AM] churavis#0000
No, if the lowest sell doesn't have enough volume to cover your order then you won't get 100% of your order immediately


[18-Apr-24 09:37 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I see what you mean


[18-Apr-24 09:38 AM] churavis#0000
Actually, I think the button we really need is a REFUEL one. That's a lot of clicking and there are very few times when I want to add less than the maximum amount of fuel

I want item transfer to be `drag + input + enter` instead of `drag + click (focus input) + input + click (change) + click(transfer) + click(close window)`


[18-Apr-24 09:42 AM] churavis#0000
You can use tab to be able to fill out the transfer window without as much clicking. This is especially useful for multiple items at once, although the "Action Successful" notification does cover everything up and is not dissmissable without a mouse click


[18-Apr-24 11:07 AM] exeler#0000
This is actually one area where I think the mobile UI is better than the desktop one.

Oh wow good find, I missed that. That was before we had the channel restrictions in


[30-Apr-24 04:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah seems like he's still in non-ANT space 🤷‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 04:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's fine though, we can have guests in the public channels


[30-Apr-24 05:20 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Regarding Uncle_Leslie69, I think naming your company after a terrorist organisation should probably be a bar to corp membership


[30-Apr-24 05:22 PM] churavis#0000
Is there a terrorist organization called  "Irish Republican Space Army" ?


[30-Apr-24 05:22 PM] draconisdomini#0000
🙄 You know what I mean


[30-Apr-24 05:23 PM] churavis#0000
I do not, that's why I ask


[30-Apr-24 05:23 PM] draconisdomini#0000
The Irish Republican Army is a terrorist organisation


[30-Apr-24 05:23 PM] churavis#0000
Are they in space yet?


[30-Apr-24 05:23 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Not that I am aware of


[30-Apr-24 05:23 PM] churavis#0000
Then I don't see the problem


[30-Apr-24 05:24 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Would we be happy with a company called Space Hamas, or Space Al-Qaeda, or the Space KKK?


[30-Apr-24 05:28 PM] churavis#0000
I would be very surprised if any of them ever made it to space either


[30-Apr-24 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
i was also personally against the name to begin with due to being personally affected at some point by said organization but the person themselves is perfectly fine, they act in good conduct


[30-Apr-24 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
don't think it should be taken too seriously


[30-Apr-24 05:54 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Likewise.  I grew up in London and am familiar with IRA bomb threats


[30-Apr-24 06:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think that's probably a fair rule (going forward). There are definitely some usernames / corp names that I wouldn't have been comfortable inviting in any case - part of why I posted here was to gauge how comfortable everyone was with it. But as a player, they've been excellent and friendly in my own experience


[30-Apr-24 06:08 PM] melon164#0000
I think it’s in fairly poor taste, and I would respect other people’s right to object more strongly, but I think we would need to think quite carefully before being more restrictive than the rules/standards of the game itself.


[30-Apr-24 06:11 PM] melon164#0000
I wouldn’t give much benefit-of-the-doubt, but their behaviour doesn’t need me to.

{Reactions}
👆 

[30-Apr-24 06:16 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I don't know whether the game rules/standards allow it, tbh.  I just messaged molp about it


[30-Apr-24 06:23 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I realise this is partly on me for not noticing when Sidepipe posted about it originally


[30-Apr-24 06:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don't think anything's on anyone - discussing recruitment is what this channel is for 😄


[30-Apr-24 06:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Molp can rename companies, he has done it before at people's request.


[30-Apr-24 06:34 PM] draconisdomini#0000
That is probably the solution


[30-Apr-24 06:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
If it's against the game rules / standards, or in general?


[30-Apr-24 06:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
In general, https://discord.com/channels/350171287785701388/562636398671298574/1222216321236865085


[30-Apr-24 06:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
and a few other times


[30-Apr-24 06:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yes, sorry - I mean is renaming the company the solution in this case? I can certainly understand asking someone to do that if it's against the game rules. I have no problem with changing the rules for recruitment going forward either. I'm just not sure how comfortable I am asking someone to do that if it's against the corp rules since they already joined, and did the trial period


[30-Apr-24 06:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I probably should have done a better job pointing out the name when I made the original post, for sure


[30-Apr-24 06:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles which is something we don't really learn about in school in the US, so I had heard of it but wasn't really aware


[30-Apr-24 06:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
everything I know about the UK I learned through harry potter


[30-Apr-24 06:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
well, I suppose first step is seeing what @uncle_leslie69 's thoughts are


[30-Apr-24 07:04 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I mean, it’s always just been an inside joke tbh, like my discord was like that to annoy an arma group I used to play in because it was just a joke. 

Like any game I’ve played I’ve just carried it over tbh, idk why, just have. 
When I used to play stellaris I called my faction the same, Irish republican space army, again, just for a joke. 

There’s no true motive behind it, nor do I support/endorse the group or it’s activities in the past. Was just always intended to be a meme? 🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:05 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I mean, when I set up my company i don’t remember their being any rules/regulations to making a company name, otherwise I would have chosen something else, hence why it made it this 🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:06 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I mean, if you really want me to change the name of it I can that molp guy, I just genuinely have no clue what else to call it atm tbh 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:07 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Ig I just wasn’t expecting it to ever be an issue since it hasn’t been thus far in multiple servers


[30-Apr-24 07:07 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I can see your points though 🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:10 PM] draconisdomini#0000
The thing with inside jokes is that they only work in the group for which they were created.  I would very much prefer you to get the name changed.  It leaves a bad taste in my mouth.


[30-Apr-24 07:10 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Like, I work in an airport in the UK and deal with this kind of stuff on flights daily so I don’t really understand this part 🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:11 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
And I lived in Glasgow for many year’s and dealt with very serious stuff too in regards to this but I didn’t let it bother me, but then again that’s just me 🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:12 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Different people have different perspectives when they are directly affected by these things


[30-Apr-24 07:12 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I guess I’m just not phased 🤷🏼‍♂️
And I know not everyone is the same way, totally get it


[30-Apr-24 07:16 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Well idk what everyone else has to say 🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:22 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Like I said before, if keeping the group members happy means trying to get my name changed then so be it. 
Whether thats possible idk 🤷🏼‍♂️


[30-Apr-24 07:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
I guess from my perspective - I should have mentioned the company name more prominently when I posted originally. The whole point was to avoid a situation like this in the first place. I think going forward we can be a bit more careful about this sort of thing when recruiting. I'm not comfortable _requiring_ @uncle_leslie69 to change the name since we let them in and did the whole trial period and everything - since this came up afterwards, it feels unfair to change the terms of their joining. If they don't have a problem changing it, I'm sure that would be appreciated


[30-Apr-24 07:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
But for what it's worth, I feel like this is on me more than it's on @uncle_leslie69  or @draconisdomini. I didn't realize there were strong feelings about it


[30-Apr-24 07:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
having lost family members in that time period and due to that organization it 100% leaves a bad taste in my mouth as well, but this is the internet, and since there aren't, as far as i know, any written rules within PrUn and prior in the discord about names, i don't think there should be much action on it in terms of leslie


[30-Apr-24 07:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
it wasn't a rule here when he joined and i don't think asking him to change it is quite fair when he joined under the assumption it was fine


[30-Apr-24 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Well if you’re willing to change it, think up a new one and I am pretty sure molp will have no problem with it. I think given the situation he will be totally on board.


[30-Apr-24 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
In general the Prun audience is a lot different from arms I’m sure. Haha.


[30-Apr-24 07:28 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Right, give me a day or 2 to be creative and I’ll think of something to change it to

Thanks Uncle_Leslie


[01-May-24 10:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
I don't really think that's fair at all to impose that on someone else


[01-May-24 10:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
and I am 100% against any kind of naming rules for companies in the corp - if they are good people, then that should be enough


[01-May-24 11:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
it's a reasonable enough request


[01-May-24 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
i was against enforcing it against Leslie due to him joining before any rule was even discussed, but in the future I definitely think naming rules could be a good idea


[01-May-24 11:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
if not having an offensive name is a bit too much to ask, maybe they'd be better of elsewhere


[01-May-24 11:45 AM] archielvahr#0000
I mean... I think a choice of a name is a behavioral choice, in a much more exaggerated example, we surely wouldn't admit someone using the N word in their name


[01-May-24 11:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
I don't like arbitrary rules left up to whoever feels most offended by a name at any given time, and yeah that's an extreme example but let me counter with signing up for Prun through Steam doesn't allow you to choose your name


[01-May-24 11:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
so if you're PonyFucker9000 on Steam as a joke or whatever, then too bad


[01-May-24 11:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
you'd have to make a new prun account (or maybe molp could change it)


[01-May-24 11:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
but arbitrary rules are why the 1st amendment exists for all cases except threats


[01-May-24 11:56 AM] hernanduer#0000
(which I realize international audience and all that, but still it's just my feelings on it)


[01-May-24 12:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
I guess to me it comes down to the persons behavior - in our recruitment pitch, we say we want to make a supportive and welcoming environment for players to play. I think that gives us leeway to get a vibe check of someone based off the persons corp / username. I was okay with Leslie because I think he has created that environment here, and did in the ADI discord before (and I think him being willing to change his name is proof of that, not that I think anyone was questioning that).


[01-May-24 12:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
That is, I don’t think we necessarily need an explicit rule. I think we can just take it case by case - we don’t invite too many players anyway 😄


[01-May-24 12:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I don't think it needs a specific rule, like Sidepipe said, it's just one part of evaluating if a person is a good culture match


[01-May-24 12:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, I'm fine to use it as a simple judge, just no rule about it - of course judgements are personal so not everyone necessarily has to agree with them, unlike a rule


[01-May-24 12:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
well since I'm new to the Corp and have contributed basically nothing I understand my opinions being less than valid on how the Corp should be ran. if people don't consider it an issue I'll drop it

The LD50 for MSG is actually higher than table salt. It takes 16,600 mg/kg of body weight of MSG to kill you, but only 3000mg/kg of table salt


[01-May-24 05:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
MSG stands for Makes Stuff Good 🙂

Wanted to put forward a name again for recruitment - I originally reached out to Hal98 and they mentioned they weren't interested in joining a corp, but they recently mentioned that they were interested in joining. I do a lot of business with them in the ADI discord, and they're quite friendly (as their corp name implies) and helpful there, so I think they'd be a good fit here 🙂

Relocation support can be provided for the right people.

that's the UFO server, you might need to `!join recruitment` to see it.

I got two potential recruits that contacted me. First is Akyan. Looks like he ticks all of our internal recruitment criteria, he's very active in ADI discords, which is a good sign for sticking aroudn and contributing to a corp. Here's his message to me

Figured others who have interacted with him might chime in.


[03-Jun-24 10:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Second user is Grey Swan, `co STWG` , user spaceangel. He's very very new but soudns great. He is going to COLIQ to ANT and probably buy pro. So I think we keep an eye on him, but it's probably too early to make a determination right now.

Akyan is chill, always talks to me and i've been helping him out a fair bit providing building mats to help him expand.

Tanda in the ADI discord was mentioning being interested in governance. Maybe a candidate for recruitment?


[25-Jun-24 09:45 AM] churavis#0000
Tanda already has a corporation


[25-Jun-24 09:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, CULT right?


[25-Jun-24 09:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’s just a smaller group of folks in ADI that wanted to put down an HQ somewhere. I’m not sure if they have any long-term plans


[25-Jun-24 09:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
But on the other hand, we can’t recruit everyone 😄


[25-Jun-24 09:47 AM] churavis#0000
Wht not?'


[25-Jun-24 09:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
I could just throw out that OOG is recruiting if they’re interested in governing and leave it at that


[25-Jun-24 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
Because we need to maintain our image as an exclusive, invite-only club - what could be more important than that? 😂


[25-Jun-24 10:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe the other people in CULT want to join too? 😄


[25-Jun-24 12:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
they did toss their HQ down on Elon to help with their PG projects they've got


[25-Jun-24 05:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd say reach out and ask them if they have any interest


[25-Jun-24 05:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think the UFO recruiting channels have been getting too much attention, and to maintain numbers it would be nice to find ~2 more people in the short term


[25-Jun-24 05:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyone who wants is welcome to post somewhere and mention the thread


[26-Jun-24 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Does anyone know MaxKalina? `co UC` Used to play a long time ago and has just recently returned?


[26-Jun-24 12:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
I talked to them and they sounded interested, but wanted to wait for the new gov meta to shake out. Just said to let me know if they're ever interested 🙂

[26-Jun-24 12:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
I wouldn't be surprised if they came around eventually. They like CULT, but that's the corp within ADI and they don't necessarily do a whole lot


[26-Jun-24 12:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I like MaxKalina so far, but mostly based outside of ANT so it might not be a good fit


[26-Jun-24 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Another potential person to reach out to `USR LancerCaster` they were the governor of Astraeus, seems to have run themselves. Fairly quiet on discord but is active in the AA group, just not as a corp member... and I don't think that was a proxy governor run but I'm not sure.


[26-Jun-24 02:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Anyone know them?


[29-Jun-24 03:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
How about ShrewdSun / `usr ShrewdSun1` I remember them from before. Recently returned, has 4 bases and a handful of loans. Not sure why the name is so familiar to me


[29-Jun-24 03:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Pretty active in community discords recently


[30-Jun-24 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Encouraging to see MaxKalina moving bases over, sounds like we'll hear more once those are in place.

Hey, y'all!  What do you guys think of ShrewdSun1?  he has potential


[03-Jul-24 01:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
Archiel mentioned him, sounds like he's worth talking to at least


[03-Jul-24 01:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
He is hanging out in our public-general while he decides if he wants to go ahead for a trial membership


[03-Jul-24 01:46 PM] archielvahr#0000

Oh yeah let's make that official. There were a few unfinished notes, maybe I can fill in any questions on there still


[03-Jul-24 04:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
You did a great job with it


[03-Jul-24 04:28 PM] akyantor#0000
I can either make it editable by anyone, or send an invite to edit if preferred. Or for that matter you can take a copy and stick it somewhere more official, if we have a spot.


[03-Jul-24 04:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think we have a better spot


[03-Jul-24 08:44 PM] katinga#0000
Anyone here have an opinion on the player SecretAce?


[03-Jul-24 09:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
The only thing I look for that I don't see is activity on discord, so maybe they just aren't in any PRUN discords or are using a different name


[04-Jul-24 09:29 AM] katinga#0000
So, when happyness is hovering right at 69%, what's the best way to nudge that past 70%?

{Reactions}
🇳 🇮 🇨 🇪 

[04-Jul-24 09:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
the amount of migration is tied to the happiness, so just past 70% won't do a whole lot if the population is small


[04-Jul-24 09:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
`num migrated = (X% - 70%) * current pop`


[04-Jul-24 09:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
so 71% will only migrate you 1% of the current population, which may only be like 20 people


[04-Jul-24 09:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
but the answer to increasing happiness accurately, is to use Archiel's chart. If you just wanna heavy hand it, then add more POPI mats


[04-Jul-24 10:09 AM] katinga#0000
I am lost on that chart


[04-Jul-24 06:02 PM] katinga#0000
he told me he's on AA and ADI.  I don't know the latter server


[04-Jul-24 06:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
ADI is the Antares development initiative. They do the grants.


[04-Jul-24 06:07 PM] archielvahr#0000

Checking in about our pending recruits and candidates:

SecretAce - Haven't really heard anything from SecretAce, not sure if they were interested in the trial or not, they've been pretty quiet in discord but they are active in-game/

JeanPaulMarat | PJI - 6 day account, joined a few days ago, no messages yet in discord. No pro yet, so I think they are still thinking about it. Will keep an eye on em.

MaxKalina - last I heard was considering moving to ANT space but hasn't so far.

TimurOm - In trial period, one base on Prom, one on Vulcan. I think technically it's been more than 7 days, so make it official..?

New pending invitee: Nanoengineer / Shinonome Sciences - new player on Phobos. They have pro but are only a couple days old. I sent them an discord guest invite and suggested they stick around a bit until they have enough experience for us to see if we are a good match for each other.


[25-Jul-24 10:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Another potential recruit reached out, company code XTC  `usr Droxx69`, I sent them to ADI as a pre-trial-trial. They are pretty early so we'll see how their ADI experience goes


[25-Jul-24 10:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
I also find tha the ADI grants I send out are a nice way to screen players and get to know them before considering them as recruits. If you think about it 750k is pretty cheap for a potential recruit.. and they don't even know they are getting screened for OOG at that point, they just think they are getting free money 😎


[25-Jul-24 10:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
hard to turn down the free money

Was in HRT, reset to be on Nike and asked me for a loan

A friendly face who might benefit from support in increasing their presence in the warm southern climate. 🤣

If i can add to this, I have exchanged alot with him over loans and he seems pretty smart and have a good grasp of what he does

looks like there's a newbie on Harm


[30-Nov-24 11:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ah I don't have a base there anymore, go ahead and say Hi, see if they have a discord and such


[07-Jan-25 10:51 AM] archielvahr#0000
I updated the internal recruitment guidelines that are pinned at the top of this channel: https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1230199856560078868/1230203707233276017


[07-Jan-25 10:52 AM] archielvahr#0000

Sounds good. ❤️


[09-Jan-25 12:11 AM] .urpalhal#0000
lol did someone invite Alt4 guy?


[09-Jan-25 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think he found the open invite


[09-Jan-25 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
there's a link on the website for the public channels


[09-Jan-25 10:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
looks like he joined overnight, cause he messaged me and he joined before I replied


[09-Jan-25 10:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
I enjoy his enthusiasm- he is like only 6 days into the game at the moment


[09-Jan-25 10:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
I did give him and ADI grant so we'll see how that goes, if he can set that up, that's great


[09-Jan-25 10:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
my inclination is usually to  wait, we generally target people who have 30d experience


[09-Jan-25 10:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
I like his enthusiasm though, heh


[09-Jan-25 10:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
any other thoughts? Should I direct towards the guideline "30 Days of overall game experience"


[09-Jan-25 10:36 AM] zipatsu#0000
6 days in, already got pro and is actively looking for a corp to join? That's about as good as you can hope for in a promising new member for this game I'd say ✌️

[09-Jan-25 11:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
I got in here with 6 days in as well 😅


[09-Jan-25 11:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
I guess I can’t talk because I also joined at 6 days 😄


[09-Jan-25 11:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
There’s probably no harm in waiting a few days if you wanna get a better read on them, but maybe not the whole 24 days


[09-Jan-25 05:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I got no problem with him


[09-Jan-25 05:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I also saw his ADI plan doing AL on Deimos


[04-Feb-25 01:55 PM] bookliko#0000
Appltee23 seems very eager to learn and progress. I believe he would thrive with some warm mentoring at OOG. He will also double the chat rate 🤣

{Reactions}
🤣 

[04-Feb-25 02:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
He’s been pretty active in the ADI too, seems pretty cool - if he’s able to buy PRO, I’d be in favor of inviting him!


[04-Feb-25 02:43 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I have some keys left to generate if any one needs pro time or a free path to a basic license.  Every account is limited to one key redemption, but I'm happy to help how I can. 

I'm happy to offer them for free to fellow OOG, but would also accept in-game donations in return if the receiver felt so inclined.


[04-Feb-25 02:44 PM] superbadsounds#0000
They're just being wasted as is, so I'd love to help people grow


[04-Feb-25 02:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah the key thing is quite interesting


[04-Feb-25 02:49 PM] bookliko#0000
I am sure Appltee is running on a gift PRO right now

[04-Feb-25 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's good to have the activity hehe


[04-Feb-25 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think when the keys expire you go back to free, rather than basic, right?


[04-Feb-25 03:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, that's right


[05-Feb-25 03:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
So for Appltee, I think things look really good. Hoping they end up with Pro/Basic first though. I haven't seen a need to rush into it


[05-Feb-25 03:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
New in the general chat is Shokanshi- not too much activity in UFO, a little in the PRUN server. He has two bases, both in ANT (etherwind counts 😉 )


[05-Feb-25 03:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
But it seems like the chat is going good. Sending him to ADI for some free money to see how that goes


[05-Feb-25 03:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
I welcome any other thoughts!


[06-Feb-25 07:38 AM] tyrandia#0000
Uhm, ADI is good. Free money is always nice!


[06-Feb-25 07:39 AM] tyrandia#0000
For appltee, I'd be happy to throw a license key their way if they seem promising.


[06-Feb-25 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I wish they had license gifting in general

{Reactions}
👆 

[09-Feb-25 10:49 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I gave him his first one so I could get him a grant in ADI


[09-Feb-25 10:49 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Can you receive multiple keys?


[09-Feb-25 10:49 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Otherwise idk what imma do with all me keys


[09-Feb-25 12:07 PM] allocater#0000
each account can only use 1 key


[03-Mar-25 05:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
HAHA


[03-Mar-25 05:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
not wrong lol


[03-Mar-25 05:40 AM] bookliko#0000
Engagement is 🔥

[05-Mar-25 03:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[05-Mar-25 03:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[05-Mar-25 03:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[05-Mar-25 03:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
63 day old company


[05-Mar-25 03:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
just got a grant from ADI


[05-Mar-25 03:27 PM] katinga#0000
he just appeared in Romulus' local chat about 2 weeks ago.  cool


[05-Mar-25 03:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
looks like he is interested in fuel refining


[05-Mar-25 03:39 PM] katinga#0000
If they join, I don't mind helping to sponsor a couple bases for him in the Rom system

Hi, I'm Archiel from OOG. I noticed you're primarily based in ANT space and wanted to know if you were interested learning more about OOG. 

Custom line: ----->
I see that you've also got some governing experience and are active in discord communities, which are both great!
----- 

OOG is the premier corp in ANT space and we feature governance training and support, shipbuilding, planetary and regional development, a discord-based internal auction/order system, and preferential material access and prices. The Bank of OOG offers loans, currency conversion, and investment opportunities, including base teleports. Our friendly group has members that are active in all timezones.

We're currently recruiting and it seems like you could be a good match. We've got a one week trial period where we see if it's a good fit for both parties. 

Let me know if you're interested, and there's a bit more info on the UFO recruitment post here:


[05-Mar-25 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
then link either the UFO post or the webpage


[05-Mar-25 07:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
🤷‍♂️


[06-Mar-25 12:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I just sent the link


[06-Mar-25 12:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
And said like hey I see you’re interested in fuel refining come check out the server if you think it’s good, someone is interested helping you get a bigger foothold in Romulan


[06-Mar-25 12:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
They said they would check it out


[06-Mar-25 12:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I might need to resend a discord invite for them tho

should I try again?


[17-Apr-25 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000

Does SanityCat look like a interesting invite? They just won an MP spot on ISA and seem pretty active.


[01-May-25 01:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
They’re in the ADI as well, and I’ve had good experiences with them there
