**SR5473**:	Hello


[21-Nov-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Hi, it's very quiet here. Too much chat attracts sandworms.


[21-Nov-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I think everyone forgot about this chat cause it wasn’t in the commas buffer


[21-Nov-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Well apart from shipping the LM is dead as well.


[22-Nov-21 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	:(


[22-Nov-21 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It seems a lot of people just use this place for extraction, judging by the CoGC


[22-Nov-21 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	pretty easy to ignore such a base


[22-Nov-21 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kapusta**:	FYI: as COGC been built i gonna build WAR in couple of weeks. as well i will start filling SST with OFF and DW to boost safety a bit


[22-Nov-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I will donate 300 MCG for the WAR


[22-Nov-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-22 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Jan-22 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	indeed, but 500 GRN in a cargo lasts a long while


[06-Jan-22 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	and the trip isn't really any worse than making Carbon over at Hortus and flying it to Moria


[06-Jan-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PawnStorm**:	Sure we'll be drowning in spaceships soon. Which might make Prism safer as the amount of HE I've built up may cause the planet to float out of its orbit.


[07-Jan-22 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Why'd Prism lose so many Pioneers last cycle?


[07-Jan-22 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jan-22 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**PawnStorm**:	No thank you, offer appreciated.


[14-Feb-22 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	remember to vote on the CoGC, metallurgy has taken the leade somehow]


[14-Feb-22 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**JarJarBings**:	I think that is fair 😀


[14-Feb-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Resouce Extraction Services is voting against Extraction, it's not fair at all


[14-Feb-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Well public shipping has been slow. Maybe Rek just has too much He and SIO?


[14-Feb-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Both choices are equally worthless to me


[14-Feb-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I lied... I do some extraction


[14-Feb-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-22 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	9 people have voted in the cogc


[13-Mar-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Though to be fair there's what 30 bases


[13-Mar-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	so that's probably actually one of the highest cogc voter turnouts in PrUn


[13-Mar-22 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	it does show the voting power of super bases though. 4 players with super bases can effectively decide what everyone else on a planet specalises in. This is made more accute with the pro requirement of voting

[25-Mar-22 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Mar-22 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Ok  I'll run and set tax to zero. I'm not setting up a solo corp as the 10% SNF Circe bonus is rather valuable to me.


[25-Mar-22 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah... I just donated some to Vallis's popi which was almost completely shut down, and that... wasn't cheap

[22-Apr-22 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Also as we are in faction space I do not believe tax rates can be set to zero. Hence I  believe we are on minimum tax.


[22-Apr-22 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Election ends in 8 hours, to confirm that we shall continue as ungovernable anarchists.

[22-Apr-22 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Apr-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	I won't give up my SNF HQ bonus on Circe so cannot run. I don't think Prism taxes being distributed across SNF would be appreciated/appropriate.

**blindartgame**:	So what does it mean to have no governor


[22-Apr-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it means taxes get black holed and nobody si responsible for upkeep of stuff


[22-Apr-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I put my name in the pot


[22-Apr-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I import virtually nothing to my base so I have a lot of inbound shipping capacity


[22-Apr-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for some reason my corp isnt' showing up on the governor screen but I made one


[22-Apr-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	prism is a starter planet, it should have a functioning government

**lowstrife**:	I got in contact with Kapusta, the old governor, he's out of time to play the game at that level


[23-Apr-22 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and he'll transfer the remaining government funds to whomever is elected


[23-Apr-22 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it'll be a rough few weeks but then we'll be in good hands


[23-Apr-22 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	The CoGC needs 44 PE or it goes on strike in 9 hours. Ads up on the LM. Anyone have a little PE?

[23-Apr-22 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I will upkeep the COGC until elected, as a bid for me to bribe your votes


[23-Apr-22 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yes, it's a bribe


[23-Apr-22 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I'll foot the bill to keep it running until elected when I'm paid to do it - though if I get the balance back from the previous govt then I'll just roll it into the running budget


[23-Apr-22 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	anyway point is: no need to contribute, I'll get some stuff inbound here


[23-Apr-22 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	though it'll take me a few days to get the stuff inbound

**warppooted**:	Happy to sell you (or anyone else) some


[30-Jun-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if you ever need PE for that BDE production, let me know, I have a lot of surplus here


[30-Jun-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**warppooted**:	Will do. I've been buying the mats and making it in my BMP, but I may take you up on that in future


[30-Jun-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i make about 6k/d, so if you decide you want to streamline production :D


[30-Jun-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	what industry are you planning @cyborg?


[30-Jun-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cyborg29x**:	i'm looking at it right now, still feeling my way around the UI a bit


[30-Jun-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cyborg29x**:	Manufacturing, though


[30-Jun-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Your starting package will help guide some decisions, but also the planet's resources are important too


[30-Jun-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	in this (current) economy, there is an HE shortage, so collecting HE here is a smart move as well


[30-Jun-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	HE.NC1


[30-Jun-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cyborg29x**:	i see, i might do that and then build something that uses the HE


[30-Jun-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	most of the things that use HE are in the Welding Plant


[30-Jun-22 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	doesnt mean you need to actually use the HE yourself, just collecting it and selling at market would be very profitable in the short term


[30-Jun-22 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cyborg29x**:	yeah that's true


[30-Jun-22 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jun-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-22 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	early game manufacturing is mostly done in BMPs


[12-Jul-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**funky-net**:	was jusst trying to figure out do u have to pay for pro to increase rating in order to take on shipping contracts?


[12-Jul-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that is correct


[12-Jul-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Local Market access and shipping contracts are limited to pro and basic


[12-Jul-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**funky-net**:	no other way to increase rating?


[12-Jul-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	right


[12-Jul-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	ratings are U (unrated) for trial accounts


[12-Jul-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there is a solid 6-12 months of content perfectly serviced by trial. but, theres a lot more direct collaboration and QoL features that pro carries


[12-Jul-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**funky-net**:	yea i see.


[12-Jul-22 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i played the first 5 months as a solo on trial, it was...slower than I liked


[12-Jul-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**funky-net**:	yea i like to do maltiple actions lol


[12-Jul-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the biggest QoL feature is recurring orders in the buildings for production runs


[12-Jul-22 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	when you get to have multiple bases, its just too important


[12-Jul-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**funky-net**:	isnt que the same?


[12-Jul-22 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	you can queue up to a few jobs on trial yes


[12-Jul-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but to have those jobs recur as they complete, is not available


[12-Jul-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	being on trial means either re-queueing jobs every few days or setting very long jobs


[12-Jul-22 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**funky-net**:	yea. inactivity will be the downfall


[12-Jul-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	inactivity is the downfall in general even for pro


[12-Jul-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	this game doesnt have a pause button


[12-Jul-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that being said, 15 mins of activity a day in the beginning is plenty to stay on top of things


[12-Jul-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as you want to be careful to not send your ships without a reason (like buying more base supplies or selling materials)


[12-Jul-22 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**funky-net**:	yea. so i cant do much untill my first job order is complete?


[12-Jul-22 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	which buildings did you build? BMP...and what else?


[12-Jul-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-22 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jul-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the long and short of it is raised resource extraction taxes 20% to try and get a bit closer to breaking even


[13-Jul-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	though I still think it's gonna be costing me - it's whatever, enough of a rounding error it's fine


[13-Jul-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i dont mind having 50% higher taxes on a specialized COGC

**shadowsneak**:	welcome welcome


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LensFog**:	What should I build with Basic Materials Plant first as a new player?


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	PE and OVE are common for new players to make


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LensFog**:	Thank you


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	here on prism there is a bonus for resource extraction, making MCG in a BMP is also a reasonable strategy


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	LST can be bought from the CX and SIO mined from the planet


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LensFog**:	Oof... it net-cost more in fuel than to make any basic thing to sell full cargo sell. :/ Meh


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	42k revenue from selling a ship full of MCG


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	about 3k in fuel costs, so 39k


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	10,800 to buy the LST needed, so let's call it 27k


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	few more bucks to run the BMP plant


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you're still netting over 50% margins per unit of MCG sold


[20-Jul-22 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and fuel is reasonably cheap

[22-Jul-22 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Garlic-Naan**:	I'm hoping to buy a little bit of fuel (both types) on prism lm so my ship can escape.


[22-Jul-22 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	Once my ship gets here I can spare some fuel if you don't get it by then


[22-Jul-22 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Garlic-Naan**:	when is that approximately?


[22-Jul-22 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Garlic-Naan**:	was going to go to sleep


[22-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	At this time, still 15hr and 11 mins


[22-Jul-22 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	So I'll probably be sleeping when it lands, so probably ~20hrs before I'll get it to you


[22-Jul-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	I won't take the contracts until I can though, so if someone else can do it they can

[22-Jul-22 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Garlic-Naan**:	yes!


[22-Jul-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Garlic-Naan**:	need at least 50 willing to pay in ica or ncc. What do you prefer?


[22-Jul-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Garlic-Naan**:	have more of ica so if you were wanting to sell more than 50 units, i'd have to pay with ica


[22-Jul-22 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eric_Vane**:	put up a buy for whatever you want, can do more than 50 units, NCC or ICA is fine


[22-Jul-22 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Eric_Vane**:	14 NCC per unit


[22-Jul-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the table is confusing


[25-Jan-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	population went from 24,456 last week to 27,562 this week


[25-Jan-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	which is a net change of 2,506 workers


[25-Jan-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	before this happened, there were 1369 open jobs


[25-Jan-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the net difference of those is 1137 spare workers


[25-Jan-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so everyone on the planet has full employment


[25-Jan-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	because I hit the pop infrastructure with a sledgehammer last week


[25-Jan-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but because this just happened "this week", there are no workers "in reserve" yet


[25-Jan-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Thx for the reply. Please keep doing what you can to increase PIO as I plan to add more to my base in the coming weeks.


[25-Jan-23 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	@lowstrife - I know we all got the workers we need and there is 114 free pioneers at the moment - first to the "mill" gets them.


[25-Jan-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	And we only have 1 - ONE Population Infrastructur building - You are just using "Immigration" to control the population.


[25-Jan-23 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	more buildings haven't been needed


[25-Jan-23 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jan-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Do I need to be concerned about the 0% unemployment? Did this many people start plopping down new bases in the past week?


[26-Jan-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah it was as bum rush


[26-Jan-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I started taking action I think two weeks ago


[26-Jan-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but these things take time, but it'll be fine


[26-Jan-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I hope so. I didn't think to include 'not being able to run more than 5 INCs due to lacking workforce' into my loan plans o.o


[26-Jan-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's less unique to this particular situation


[26-Jan-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there is a limit to how many workers you can take in one bite from the planet


[26-Jan-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	10% of the spare workers, which on a small world, isn't a lot


[26-Jan-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it's best, if possible, to accomidate plopping down a base just before the pop report hits


[26-Jan-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	where everything gets redistributed


[26-Jan-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Hrmmmm, when is the next pop report gonna hit?


[26-Jan-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	5d 13h


[26-Jan-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Well, the next layer of my base will arrive in 3-ish days, that's good enough, I guess.


[26-Jan-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	just make sure you have everthing built before it hits


[26-Jan-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(another 200 PIOs worth, doubt that is subject to change)


[26-Jan-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and you'll get full employment


[26-Jan-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Noted, and will do. Also, I wonder how the prospect of 3 more full, presumably INC, bases are gonna hit the C market.


[26-Jan-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would hope favorably


[26-Jan-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the amonut of demand destruction happening at these prices is insane


[26-Jan-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	careful not to get caught up in the gult that will hit in a month


[26-Jan-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it'll oversupply


[26-Jan-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	overrun and probably run it back into the 300's


[26-Jan-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	unless we're fortunate and we get a soft landing


[26-Jan-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and float around 450


[26-Jan-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I'm primarily producing with low cost GRN, so even 300 would still, just barely, be profitable. But it's gonna shakeup the people running triple recipes, for sure.


[26-Jan-23 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	running the triple recipe is never the standard choice


[26-Jan-23 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it only makes sense if the price is insane, in which case it's temproary


[26-Jan-23 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	or if you need to slightly boost production to meet internal consumption


[27-Jan-23 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	In some sense, if you got a pure INC base, there's another good argument for the triple recipe: It equalizes input and output tonnage. With the single recipe it's 1:2, with the triple it's 1:1 (and x3 in relative terms)


[27-Jan-23 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	But yeah, I'm using a single recipe as a baseline, spliced in with a dual recipe that burns off a surplus production of HCP from my HYF that got nothing better to do.


[27-Jan-23 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(the single recipe being GRN)


[27-Jan-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah it's equal tonnage but still


[27-Jan-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	marginal cost is pretty important


[27-Jan-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	either way good conditions f or carbon at the moment


[27-Jan-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	we'll see how long they last


[27-Jan-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	given the growth of this planet, I give it one month tops before prices absolutely collapse


[27-Jan-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	we'll probably see next pop report just how much growth it will be


[27-Jan-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Corps are just like guilds in MMOs basically. Gives you good access to resources and advice for cheap.


[28-Jan-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	You can join mine if you like, we have a large, active discord and you can buy many resources in the game for cheaper than CX and also be a part of large, multiplanet projects. Plus people regularly give out big loans to help people expand.


[28-Jan-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Is there any cost to join a Corp? Do I have to be able to afford some shares?


[28-Jan-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Jan-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Yeah, I've mathed out that I'll stick with my current 150 area worth of INCs. I can only dedicate 1 ship to running the logistics here, so that's nearing the limit for what I can reliable move to CX with a 500er vessel. I'll consider expanding Prism-INCs further after I upgrade my ship in a month or two, assuming C prices are still good then.

[31-Jan-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Correct. You also cannot interact with players directly via private contracts (which is less visible than LM, but actually a larger share of transactions than LM)


[01-Feb-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LRH**:	so to have fun and actually play the game I have to buy an account


[01-Feb-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	You need to at least buy PRO *once*. After that you get permanent BASIC account status, which allows you to accept (if not initiate) contracts and LM ads. So, yes, the game is free-to-try, but 8$-to-play-proper.


[01-Feb-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LRH**:	fair enough I guess


[01-Feb-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	*shrug* apparently. Probably was simply the first big players to make planetfall or something. Keep in mind that being governeur means you got to provide all the upkeep and manage the upgrades for planetary infrastructure. So it's a rather high volume thing that only established playesrs can do.


[01-Feb-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Wasn't it "Pro to run for governeur, free to vote"?


[01-Feb-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	oh?


[01-Feb-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/pro-license/index.html states that you need PRO to *run* for a governeurship, it doesn't specify whether you need it to *vote*. In any case, there's the additional qualification that your base needs to be 14 (iirc) days old before you get to vote.

**Drevil**:	Question: If my PIO efficiency is at 100.0% and RE bonus is 25% and my Expert Bonus is 3.06% = 128.7% total. Then why does my actual production Effiency calculated in my production queues calc out to only 122.8% ? Where did the missing 5.9% go?


[04-Feb-23 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	(and new buildings)


[04-Feb-23 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bistion**:	Whats your PIO satisfaction?  Isnt Efficiency just what percent of you needed workers are actually covered by population?


[04-Feb-23 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bistion**:	Oh i see worker satisfaction is 100.   Missed that.


[04-Feb-23 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bistion**:	Id guess it is because of building condition not being 100%


[04-Feb-23 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	new buildings 99.9%


[04-Feb-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Perhaps my calc method is wrong. I am adding the various bonuses together rather than multiplying them with one another. Is that correct?


[04-Feb-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Maybe some factor I have missed?


[04-Feb-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bistion**:	Not sure.  Even multiplying together should be higher than 122


[04-Feb-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bistion**:	Im about to build an Ext.  Will see what it comes out to.  My Col is 126% with building condition at 95


[04-Feb-23 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bistion**:	119% but PIO is 89% eff


[04-Feb-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Well I can't quite figure it out. Prunner shows my EXTproduction efficiency should be 128% but when I look at the actual hrs/min prod time it calcs out to an efficiency of only 122.9% ?


[04-Feb-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	(9.77hrs actual vs 9.26hrs prunner)

[04-Feb-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	something isn't at 100% for you


[04-Feb-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I did that, but it still seems wrong to me. How can 9hrs 46min be 129%Eff on a basic production time of of 12hrs? That is only 122.9% eff


[04-Feb-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Basically at 12h Prod run should not take 9h 46m (9.77hrs) to complete at 129% Efficiency. It shoud only take 9h 18m (9.3023)


[04-Feb-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	What am I doing wrong? (Sorry for the long rant , just trying to figure this one out.)

**lowstrife**:	which is 9.741hr at 129%


[04-Feb-23 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	did you do your calculations @720 minutes rather than 754 minutes?


[04-Feb-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Not sure what you mean about 754m. On my base my Prod Lines shows 9h46m per cycle (9.7666 hrs) at an overal Efficiency of 129%. However, that does not seem correct to me. 12hrs = 720m. 720/1.29 = 558.139m = 9.302hrs =  9h 18m  <--- This should be the correct duration, not 9h 46m.


[04-Feb-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Could it be your HQ faction?


[04-Feb-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	So the "real" efficiency is actually only 122.9%  I don't know where the 9h 46m even comes from. It doesn't make sense to me.

**--SCHAITR--**:	If I shifted it to 100% efficiency by removing CoGC and experts, the base extraction time for 11 SIO is 12h34m

[04-Feb-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it just depends


[04-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Oh, I did not know that.


[04-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I can see how that's confusing though


[04-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	sorry


[04-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's the first time I've ever looked at the building in that regard


[04-Feb-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	cause that's where the difference is!


[04-Feb-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I just assumed that the BUI listing for each one was the "base" duration before Eff% modifier.


[04-Feb-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I'm not sure why the output quantity and the production runtime are different


[04-Feb-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah


[04-Feb-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	mystery solved ;)


[04-Feb-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have another base where @ 100% it's 13h 27m


[04-Feb-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Again, I am super sorry to bother everyone with my confusion. My bad. Thanks for clearing it up for me.


[04-Feb-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I believe different planets have different extraction rates


[04-Feb-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yea what @lowstrife said


[04-Feb-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	How would I know that, until you guys told me?


[04-Feb-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	It is not clearly stated anywhere.


[04-Feb-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	yea it isn't that clear in game, especially with the opaque "resource bars" in PLI


[04-Feb-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there are a few problems like that within the game lol


[04-Feb-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	where you just have to *know* things


[04-Feb-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I've been trying to smooth those things out over time with the devs and add them in


[04-Feb-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah


[04-Feb-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd really have liked for the numbers to pop up when I mouse over the resource bars


[04-Feb-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	the fertility bar confused me for a long time


[04-Feb-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Well, thank you guys very much for putting up with me and helping me find the answer. I really do appreciate it.


[04-Feb-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We learned something from it as well (together with whoever's reading)


[04-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Actually, can you now explain where the 129% Eff rate comes from? 100% PIO + 3.06 Exp + 25.0 CoGC = 128.06% by my calc. so why 129%?


[04-Feb-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	it's multiplicative


[04-Feb-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	that's why 5 experts + CoGC is so powerful


[04-Feb-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Btw, experts are also multiplicative within themselves


[04-Feb-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I would need to see an example of the formula.


[04-Feb-23 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	in your example, I got 128.75% so I guess it's rounded up


[04-Feb-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	100% * 103.06% * 125% = 128.75%


[04-Feb-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	so not just added together as a string?


[04-Feb-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Aaaaaaaaah! I have seen the light.


[04-Feb-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	welcome to the dark side of endless theory crafting ;)


[04-Feb-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I think you can push 170% in some setups


[04-Feb-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	HQ + corp HQ + COGC + experts


[04-Feb-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it compounds


[04-Feb-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	that's mad lol


[04-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	a bit, yeah


[04-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	mad profits, mad shipping, and maybe going mad trying to plan it


[04-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	at those rates too it's beter to repair buildings more often since you get more gain by staying up there


[04-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lol I have 25 bases


[04-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and I do the entire electronics supplychain


[04-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well, almost


[04-Feb-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you can go pretty mad lol. especially when you forget\don't have that one thing


[04-Feb-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	i'll keep to my little food set up ;)


[04-Feb-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I feel like a speck of dust by comparison. - Lol


[04-Feb-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	@lowstrife, if your talking to the devs; I think they should consider giving more starting base help to new players. I know you can exceed the plot limit on your first base, but not being able to build your future bases on any of the "full" planets is a huge disadvantage imho. I think +plots should be allowed for at least your first 3 bases. Otherwise, what? I can never have a base on Montem, if I chose not to start there? That is stupid.


[04-Feb-23 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	you can, if you're patient


[04-Feb-23 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Counterargument: So you want to have an entire universe, where all players focus on settling the same three infinitely crowded planets? And doesn't this measn that older players who settle more then 3 starter planets would still have an advantage?


[04-Feb-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	fair point, I am not sure what the proper answer is here, but I know my options are severely limited since starting on Prism.


[04-Feb-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I know I could Coliq but that doesn't really fix the issue either.


[04-Feb-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The proper answer is to make the universe's offer of planets dynamic. If progressively more rich planets are discovered (and you implement a 'gold rush' mechanic that dynamically moves starter planets to those new discoveries, or maybe a way for factions to subsidize new player's expansion to those planets), you would negate the relevance of starter planets, and keep the markets fresh and unstable:D


[04-Feb-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	@Schaitr - Montem is presently +36 plots - how long a wait do you think that is going to be?


[04-Feb-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	@ Alblaka, I like that idea. Sounds much more interesting to play with a constently changing universe.


[04-Feb-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I really do not know, because it depends on how many inactives get taken off (and we don't know when that would be)


[04-Feb-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Maybe newer players should get "front of the line" treatment. As it is I feel like I am trying to buy concert tickets on Ticketmaster to Taylor Swift concert.


[04-Feb-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there are forums where people put suggestions on


[04-Feb-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and other such things


[04-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but the dev(s) aren't super attentive if I'm honest


[04-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	stuff moves slow


[04-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I don't know why they arne't going all-in on the new player expeirence to minimize the number of people having frustrations at firs


[04-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	tbut we're instead getting a new skin to the UI


[04-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Drevil**:	How about offering some sort of incentive bonus for exploring unexplored areas of the map as it grows ever bigger? Unlocking new planets, new resouces even though the distances might get vast. It would be fun.


[04-Feb-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Constantly colonizing outward from the crowded center.


[04-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	that's not really how it works


[04-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there are already natural forces to incentivize that sort of thing


[04-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	higher resoiurce deposits


[04-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and also plot count limits


[04-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	though these aren't great systems


[04-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but as a new player, that sort of exploration can't be done by everyeone... like it wouldn't take long for everything to get explored


[04-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and setting up new planets from zero isn't a new player thign either


[04-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**McGangsta**:	what is the avg shipping rate per ton to MOR?


[05-Feb-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	With a ballpark of 2k fuel costs for a single trip, I'd calculate 4NCC/t self-shipping. So slightly above that for foreign shipping, plus you'll have to compete with people shipping heavy carbon towards CX (shipping *from* CX is likely to be cheaper). So I'd guess shipping rate in the 5-10/t hallmark.

**luke_labs**:	Hi guys and gals theres some shipping jobs to take seems like they're 98 tons and I have 500 tons in my hold should I just take five of those jobs and ship them at the same time or is that going to use too much fuel


[15-Feb-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Definitely do the math first. Arclight is a long way from here. I'm looking at 14k for a roundtrip. And you'll actually spend a full FTL tank to get to arlight, so you'll be *forced* to buy up 600 FF there (for the flight back + to refill yourself once you're back at prism, since Prism doesn't really offer much fuel). and you would earn 12.500 from the shipping. So you're looking at a net loss, unless you also find something on Arclight to ship back.


[15-Feb-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	It's a solid offer for a one-way trip, but you got nothing to pay your way back :P


[15-Feb-23 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**luke_labs**:	I see right currency conversion

***Lyne** left.*


[15-Feb-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I did not even account for currency conversion, because the loss there is irrelevantly small. The problem is you get paid 12.5k for doing a 7k cost flight, without being paid for the 7k cost return trip. 14k > 12.5k. Add to that your ship will be gone for 6d, and that's a bad use of ship-days. Unless you can find something worthwhile to ship back from Arclight. Which *could* be possible, but I wouldnt know.

**McGangsta**:	With all the Carbon that moves in and out of Prism, should we look at upgrading the WAR?


[16-Feb-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I personall do not need a WAR at all, because STO is the best WAR. I think WAR is more for people who do NOT have a base on prism.


[16-Feb-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	And then the question is "do we have enough foreign traders here that it warrants spending on making bulk async trade even more feasible". Given we're probably exporting a lot directly to CX, I doubt that.

[16-Feb-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	And it is not that we are out of units, but some players cannot rent enuff space...I am maxed out on WAR, do I need them, not really, but it kicks money into the system, and think, rent is freemoney from outsiders


[16-Feb-23 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	like I said it's not cheap to get enough to get to level I think 8 where you can rent a 2k warehouse

**RedAngel**:	what benefits do i get for upgrading my HQ, as a non supporter? i see the possibility of extra queue lines which are needed on my end


[25-Feb-23 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Higher HQ gives you more permits, which can be used to create new bases or expand existing ones


[25-Feb-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	I see the limiting factor is the ship transportability... being stuck with 1000t means im going to be buying a supporter pack soon, whether i like it or not.


[25-Feb-23 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	having the ability top upgrade my ships, buy more, and the inf production queue is really handy


[25-Feb-23 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	they are indeed


[25-Feb-23 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	But it's still possible to profit without getting the package, so it really depends on your goals


[25-Feb-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	havent really thought about goals


[25-Feb-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	just making cash off an easy supply of minerals right now.


[25-Feb-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	my daily profit is sitting at about 2k or so per SIO extractor, but im looking to increase that by adding more extractors


[25-Feb-23 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	possibly branching out into more than only SIO


[25-Feb-23 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	thats why i was curious about adding more to the production queue slots


[25-Feb-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RedAngel**:	ah, just read tht you can only go up to level 5, get your first queue upgrade and then its pro only


[25-Feb-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**McGangsta**:	looks like the upkeep on some of the pop buildings was missed


[01-Mar-23 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	i will bring OFF/SUN from MOR on my next trip, I have DW on the way, but it will not make it before the next cycle


[01-Mar-23 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	How long till your DW hits?


[01-Mar-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Nvm, it's just 50 DW consumption, not 100+. I can cover that much from my local consumable stock.


[01-Mar-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(Though cant do much abotu the OFF). Also, isn't that @lowstrife's job?

**Cobalt70**:	Oh... What are they talking about?


[01-Mar-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lost 1000 or 2000 pio's per week to natural bleed


[01-Mar-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I thought the safety I put down would be enough turns out it's not


[01-Mar-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and gangsta you should not do that


[01-Mar-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well, what I added two weeks ago would be enough... but I forgot about the moving average


[01-Mar-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	happiness works with a moving average, so any changes you make are delayed


[01-Mar-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so I didn't act soon enough\as much as was needed


[01-Mar-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	to combat the 1000\week drain from bases expiring


[01-Mar-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	two periods ago we were at 9.4% unemployment, previous measures lapsed, one period ago it slipped to 2.4% and so I acted... which wasn't enough


[01-Mar-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	no worries, we are all in this together, I couldn't do it, so I am willing to help however I can


[01-Mar-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	meh ya'll pay taxes, that's what they're there for


[01-Mar-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for me to correctly use them


[01-Mar-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	I had the supplies on-world


[01-Mar-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	we just need a bigger buffer to never have this happen again


[01-Mar-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Mar-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Mar-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Mar-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	when selecting your starting planet in the start screen, you need to look for the star rating in suitability


[03-Mar-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	prism, at most, can make MCG for manufacturing


[03-Mar-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Mar-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	really?


[03-Mar-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	interesting


[03-Mar-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well, it's... okay for it


[03-Mar-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but the price of MCG is really crummy right now


[03-Mar-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	which really isn't a fault of you or the guide then - prices change all the time


[03-Mar-23 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Drevil**:	So with zero PIOs available in the workforce pool atm, what would happen if you constructed a new INC for example? Would it slow down all the rest of your existing buildings production rates until a new batch of PIOs are added (On Tuesday)?


[05-Mar-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Based on what I can see, constructing new PIO buildings will only allow you 2 new PIOs from the pool


[05-Mar-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Although you will get the 2 PIOs, how much production efficiency drops will depend on how many PIOs are missing


[05-Mar-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	right, I thought so.


[05-Mar-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	you can construct the buildings just before POPR happens to maximise the PIO pull and bonus to happiness due to open jobs. This will also draw some PIOs for you from the common pool when the pops are redistributed on POPR


[05-Mar-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	shhh, don't tell everyone else that or they will do the same - LOL


[05-Mar-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Mar-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wakanda**:	With the lack of Infrastructure it will be a problem for som time


[06-Mar-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	I dont think so, I think the issue is fixed, but the POP report works on a rolling AVG, so we need to see what happens this Wednesday, and how it effects the report.  We have upgraded the safety station, and the consumables are now taken care of, so we should start trending in the right direction again.


[06-Mar-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	and we are almost upgraded to level 3 Safety Station


[06-Mar-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	nice - so we are building infrastructure


[06-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	fwiw it wasn't necessary


[06-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I just didn't add the necessary upkeep


[06-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	lvl 3 certainly isn't necessary on the SST


[06-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it's too late for that now, & I already said it wasn't needed a while back when you said you were gonna contribute


[06-Mar-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wakanda**:	You are in control here - no argument - the safety station upkeep and upgrade is cheap and you rejected my contribution to build and upkeep it earlier. So no worries., your the governor.

[06-Mar-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**McGangsta**:	sweet


[07-Mar-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	so we should be good to drop buildings and expect to get PIOs?


[07-Mar-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	Not sure, the PIO satisfaction works on a 5 week AVG I think, depends on how we rebound, but I would think next week at the latest


[07-Mar-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	hopefully. I am dropping some buildings to hopefully get filled


[07-Mar-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well all population gets redistrubted every pop report


[07-Mar-23 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so as long as you're not the biggest employer, you will get 100% of your workers


[07-Mar-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so building buildings is always worth it, especially if it's right before the pop report


[07-Mar-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Mar-23 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Mar-23 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Mar-23 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Mar-23 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	hmm that is uhh strange. you should have full employment if you built the buildings before the pop report


[08-Mar-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I have full 1300\1300 employment - anyone with a 500 area base should be fine


[08-Mar-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	round robin takes from the biggest employers first, so anyone with a 750 or 1000 area base is out (sorry!)


[08-Mar-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	idk why you're short

**Drevil**:	So just so I understand this correctly, we currently have 3.5k open PIO jobs until Wed morning. Can we expect to attract enough PIO immigration to more than overcome this deficiency or will be in a shortage situation again next week?


[09-Mar-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the actual unemployment isn't actually the open jobs figure. It's 3499, minus 2655, so the current unemployment is 844


[09-Mar-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	which yes will be gone next week


[09-Mar-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yes that's a bit backwards & difficult to understand. totally intuitive, totally makes sense, welcome to prun lol


[09-Mar-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	I was going to say "It would be really nice if it didn't just say THE RULES HAVE CHANGED, but also point out the actual change." Thanks for clarifying that and sure, that seems reasonable. And we're already paying low taxes anyways. *looks at Midway new gov raising FI taxes to 45*

[05-Apr-23 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but going to shove ~150k into the SST again, notop of what the gentlemen already contributed a month ago (not counted here)


[05-Apr-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I don't see a need to generate more tax income after this - even with the runrate cost of SST tripling over the past few months.

[11-Apr-23 04:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Because I'm already at a profit volume where I'm trying to get a flag onto Vallis to shift over my entire base away from here, because C farming just doesn't deliver profits worth the logistical upkeep. If the price drops some more, I might just quit the industry entirely and do something else alltogether XD

[12-Apr-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	The problem, to me, is that Carbon is a high logistical load chain. Agri is bulky, C is heavy, and it's a mass product. So even if it's still net profitable, it competes with the option of me retooling agri+carbon into *several other bases* worth of profits, given I'm limited by shipping throughput. But I suppose that's an early-mid player problem, and big mass carbon producers don't need to worry about that because they got enough ships anyways. Hence the drop in price is irrelevant to them.

[04-May-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I can keep it for you till you ship it out


[04-May-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I legit don't know if I can keep up until I get a 3rd ship - so sure - but you're welcome to just sell it off

**bodian**:	Apologies I know you say on discord to let you know before setting up to give you a chance to prepare but this slipped my mind :)

**--SCHAITR--**:	If you wait for the next POPR they should come. You used up more than your allotment of the workforce reserve.

[08-May-23 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	iirc, every new base adds to needed cogc upkeep. there's been quite a few bases since may 1st, might be you needed to contribute more


[08-May-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VizoR**:	know a few governors who wait with cogc upkeep almost until it's time for it to kick in


[08-May-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	no it doens't work like that, it doesn't un-fulfill the COGC just because someone added a new base


[08-May-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I must have just not actually clicked the button

**Alblaka**:	*only C, SIO is 1.9 actually.


[17-May-23 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	*1.79, ffs


[17-May-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	manufacturing gives a lot of different choices but Prism is probably geared to be making MCG with it's supply of SIO as an easy one. You'd just need to fly in LST

[17-Oct-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	That will depend on the ship you are building. You have to create a Blueprint, that will tell you the supplies it takes to make.


[17-Oct-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Expect about 4mil


[17-Oct-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	holy molly my workers gonna get some paycuts for this


[17-Oct-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Your best bet is to upgrade your current ships first - then worry about 3rd and 4th ships


[17-Oct-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	^


[17-Oct-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I paid 6 for a new ship just buying it from the cx


[17-Oct-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	private deals can be 5 or lower, especially if you're willing to wait for week(s)


[17-Oct-23 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I paid 3.05M for a WCB ship from Felmer - but that was like 3 months ago so prices likely changed - and yes wait was a full month but hey at 3m I can't complain


[17-Oct-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	As soon as you can afford it and support it without straining your shipping.


[18-Oct-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	you can do that


[13-Nov-23 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but I would recommend against it - there are far more profitable ways to do that (endgame stuff)


[13-Nov-23 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so it's kind of a slow start


[13-Nov-23 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Cataclism**:	Wazup


[06-Dec-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Talking about settlers, looks like we have a shortage of them


[06-Dec-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	there anything that can be done about that?


[06-Dec-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	like if buisness was booming on Prism would that lead to more settlers?


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I guess the only thing that can be done is upkeeping pop infrastructure, and maybe building some more, and that's quite expensive


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	bugger


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, that's not to worry at the start, pioneers are doing fine here (although slightly declining)!


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	so Prism is overall in decline, thats not great


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I wouldn't say so


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	well i aint planning on leaving the world


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Probably a bunch of players starting to play and then abandoning the game, and their men migrate away, I guess


[06-Dec-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	damn, well hey once im better set up im happy to do what i can to help Prism endure


[06-Dec-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	there isn't a shortage of seelers


[06-Dec-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	though yes, it's close


[06-Dec-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I just assumed that settlers are running low cuz I see at my BBC and it says 0 settlers will be available instantly


[06-Dec-23 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	actually, settlers are out


[06-Dec-23 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
***lowstrife** deleted this message.*


[06-Dec-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well it's 5.5% unemployment on the pop report


[06-Dec-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	down from 14% in just a week, someone dropped a big base of them


[06-Dec-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	hopefully things improve


[06-Dec-23 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	im starting off here and plan on maintaining my base here as my HQ


[06-Dec-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Btw, what start did you pick?


[06-Dec-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	went for manufacturing


[06-Dec-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's a small world, one person dropping a full base can send the figures from being fine to needing adjustment in 1 week


[06-Dec-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so this happens from time to time vs. the big worlds


[06-Dec-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yay, fellow manufacturer here! :)


[06-Dec-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	well hey bob maybe we can make Prism the manufacturing cornerstone of the NEO lmao


[06-Dec-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Will it fix itself, or does it need some investment?


[06-Dec-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Lol hell nah, not in next 2-3 months :D


[06-Dec-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you couldn't afford to fix it lol


[06-Dec-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I just put $350,000 into it


[06-Dec-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's my job as the govenor


[06-Dec-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the game should warn you about contributing to the planetary projects, as a new player


[06-Dec-23 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's a common mistake


[06-Dec-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	goddamn


[06-Dec-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	either way Prism will prevail


[06-Dec-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	^


[06-Dec-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	long live Prism glory to the PDA and all that


[06-Dec-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Btw, what is a reason for Prism having resource extraction COGC?


[06-Dec-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	helium and silicon


[06-Dec-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and I have a carbon refining base here


[06-Dec-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's one of the only places to extract silicon (that's developed)


[06-Dec-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Wow, I thought SIO is more abundant, that's interesting


[06-Dec-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	So you're probably importing like a ton of oxygen :)


[06-Dec-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	well it kind of us


[06-Dec-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but it's just this place has existed forever so it's the primary supplier


[06-Dec-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	i may be trying to convince a friend to sign up for the game and set up on Prism


[06-Dec-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	@Sammy-D They would be better off putting their first base on one of the starter planets like Vallis or Montem because those planets are near impossible to get a base on otherwise. Prism has tons of space


[06-Dec-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	this is where i started lmao


[06-Dec-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	so far stuff is going well


[06-Dec-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	ngl was half tempted to make my company name on here a Warhammer reference


[06-Dec-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	it technically is


[06-Dec-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	When I was choosing my company name, I went straight for a stupid reference with no doubt whatsoever


[06-Dec-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	mines still a reference, just a subtle one


[06-Dec-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sammy-D**:	a reference to my fave warhammer faction


[06-Dec-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I only know about 40k from memes, so no idea what it is :)

**Copious**:	Honestly Sammy I immediately thought you were making a Battletech reference with PPC


[07-Dec-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	and I second Kahn's suggestion. Prism is a great place, but Promitor can only be gotten by brand new accounts so it is a very high value starter planet, combines with the rarity of Fertile planets.


[07-Dec-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	*combined


[07-Dec-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	If your buddy starts on Prom, he can sell you Ag products to burn here on Prism, it's a win/win


[07-Dec-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	(assuming you both have Pro)


[07-Dec-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	It's a bit of a flight but tbh a lot of the fertile planets are a bit of a flight here


[07-Dec-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Right, to echo copius, starting on the starter planets is not better or worse, it just guarantees that you will have a base there when you almost will never have another chance to do so. I would kill for a base on Montem, but it will probably never happen because I started on Vallis, but if I hadn't started on Vallis, my company would look a lot different than it does now


[07-Dec-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	And Montem is basically always full, people in my corp have waited months or years to get bases on starter planets and some still haven't


[07-Dec-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Dec-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	mining


[19-Dec-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	well I picked that faction


[19-Dec-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	is that what you mean?


[19-Dec-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yep


[19-Dec-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Mining it is


[19-Dec-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	how do I sell what I mine btw?


[19-Dec-23 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	You load it into the ship and send the ship to the nearest commodity exchange (MOR)


[19-Dec-23 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	hmm seems simple


[19-Dec-23 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	so mine some hel and send it to market to sell


[19-Dec-23 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Just probably wait a bit for your materials to stockpile before flying them there


[19-Dec-23 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yup


[19-Dec-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	saids its halted


[19-Dec-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Did you build HB1?


[19-Dec-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Or maybe your worker supplies are in the ship, not in the base inventory


[19-Dec-23 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackHorn**:	what?


[19-Dec-23 04:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**wpwilecoyote3**:	when were able to vote if you could vote for me that would be greatly appreciated as i have a contract for being elected gov.


[20-Dec-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	Rohan is mine!


[20-Dec-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	lol


[20-Dec-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Sorry, but lowstrife runs this whole place, and does it pretty well, so probably no chances on this planet


[20-Dec-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	Guys, but he has a contract to be governor. This is pretty compelling to me. Lowstrife doesn't have a contract.


[20-Dec-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Hmm...


[20-Dec-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**wpwilecoyote3**:	i have no intention of changing anything and am planning on conferring with lowstrife when i have questions about things


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well... why don't you choose some other planet? I guess there some with either still no governors, or abandoned ones


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Sabaton in a neighbouring system was abandoned some time ago for a while, and I guess this is not an uncommon situation


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you need to have a base on the planet to be GOV


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	though I'm not 100% sure


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Probably yes, but is that such of a problem?


[20-Dec-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	for a new player it might be


[20-Dec-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	if they have to settle the world first just to get the gov


[20-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, it depends on how many reds are on the planet, but I wouldn't say it's impossible for 2 month old company


[20-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It will be an overkill for a contract, but running for gov just for a contract is an overkill anyway


[20-Dec-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	what's your long term plan?


[21-Dec-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**wpwilecoyote3**:	im working on vertical integration.  owning resources and building each tier it will take several  planets.  currently have planned 4 bases other than my main on prism.  second will be verdant for dw, and rat, Rhazes for fuel, circa for more manufacturing, and  JS-572c  dont know what im going to do there quite yet other than resource extraction.


[21-Dec-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I hear some idiot is offering subsidies for new bases on Circa


[21-Dec-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	you do to vote


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but not to run


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	(I know because I am governor at a planet I don't have a base on thanks to Fire)


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	YA-471C to be precise, if you want to fact check me


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	the problem being someone has to be there to vote for you or you won't win


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Copious**:	but there are plenty of people looking for proxy governors right now or on mostly abandoned planets that might help you out, much more likely than beating Lowstrife on one of the most popular Moria area bases


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	oh there's your answer


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah I didn't know whether yes\no


[22-Dec-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**wpwilecoyote3**:	ok ill try that once this election is over.  if/when i lose


[22-Dec-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	What are your election promises?


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	not changing anything would probably bankrupt you as an individual player fwiw


[22-Dec-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	maybe, depends on the timing of when popi upkeep is needed


[22-Dec-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the optimal way to do things is in batches at once, sink 300-500k into the infratructure

[24-Dec-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordgier**:	I mean - if you want SIO it's great, and if you want to burn stuff here it's really great


[24-Dec-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Teras_Kasi**:	Unrated is barred from posting ads... maybe it's an anti-bot countermeasure? That's the only thing that makes sense to me.


[22-Jan-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Unrated means you don't have pro license, and it is required to use local market


[22-Jan-24 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	That is a measure against burner accounts, because new player's starting capital is quite thick

**someart**:	Hey guys, what's an example of a good production for Prism? I'm stuck here with BMPs (started as manufacturer) but planning on opening another base somewhere around Moria so I'm just curious, what do I convert the current one on Prism into? I tried some ideas with INC &HE/SIO extraction on prun, but none looks viable to me comparing to BMPs here (but I can't scale those here though). Thanks!


[19-Feb-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i think good production advice will open the floodgates and make it not so much of a good advice... Pick what has low supply and high demand and roll with it i'd say, don't listen to what others suggest you to make


[19-Feb-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	a lot of the reward of the game is figuring it out for yourself


[19-Feb-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**someart**:	gotcha! I understand the general concept of course, just couldn't wrap my head around Prism and what it's good for :)

**bobnobrain**:	Happens to best of us


[26-Feb-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	there is no money to be made starting out as a manufacture. the math puts me at loosing more money to prduce than i would make to sell


[26-Feb-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Are you sure? I mean, markets have changed since I picked manufacturing, but it should still be profitable enough


[26-Feb-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	PE.NC1 is a bit low nowadays, but so is C.NC1


[26-Feb-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And I would also recommend doing EXO.NC1 by producing first PE, then OVE (with RCO.NC1), and then EXO (with some AL.NC1)


[26-Feb-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	it would cost 15000 to buy the resources needed to pump out what it starts me with and i would get less than half the cost in profit

**bobnobrain**:	What recipe is that?


[26-Feb-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	mcg


[26-Feb-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, my back-of-envelope calculations say that you will need ~4*200 for LST.NC1, ~2*100 for SIO.NC1, and you will get ~25*50 MCG.NC1, which gives profit of 250$ per 6 hours (transport fees and worker wages not included)


[26-Feb-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Not the most profitable thing, I agree


[26-Feb-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	But have you tried looking into other recipes?


[26-Feb-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	im looking over the other recipes right now


[26-Feb-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	PE is the one usually suggested for manufacturers at the start


[26-Feb-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	You should've probably got materials for it in your starter inventory


[26-Feb-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	so far all of there material cost is double or higher than what i can sell the finished product at


[26-Feb-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	For PE you can get 200*8$ - (C) 580$ - (H) 2 * 100$ = 1600$ - 780$ = 880$ per recipe, which is about triple of that in a day


[26-Feb-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Can't see why can it be not profitable


[26-Feb-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	misread where the decimal was for carbon prices


[26-Feb-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Oh, I see :)


[26-Feb-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, anyway, PE is totally a good start


[26-Feb-24 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	will make a profit off it. probably wont produce mcg anymore tho


[26-Feb-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yeah, that one is more useful to just building new factories


[26-Feb-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	There's actually a neat tool for picking the most profitable recipe out there


[26-Feb-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	https://universallogistics.app/building/BMP


[26-Feb-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Just click all the settings so that they match your situation


[26-Feb-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordKeene**:	ooo ok thanks


[26-Feb-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**someart**:	LordKeene, just make sure to take a market volume into account. Cuz some recipes on universallogistics.app may show up as quite profitable while in reality it's hard to sold them (too long to wait)


[26-Feb-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I would be wary of that tool


[26-Feb-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it doesn't average the prices it pulls from the cx's


[26-Feb-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so the daily ROI can be misleading, as it can vary quite dramatically


[26-Feb-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think the interface is kind of crummy too


[26-Feb-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	I think the recipe selector in prunplanner.org is far superior


[26-Feb-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	https://prunplanner.org/


[26-Feb-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	once you select the building, all the recipes (and their daily ROI) is listed


[26-Feb-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so that you can view them by building


[26-Feb-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's a lot slicker


[26-Feb-24 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and you can do so much more with the tool too

[17-Apr-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	First no one can sell a ship. U have buy parts and build yourself. Second u have to have PRO licence. Third u can only buy engine with 1M NCC. Standard ships cost about 2-5M.

[09-May-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-May-24 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	Just a general point on governing, in most cases the cost running the planet (COGCs, POPI, Programs) is higher than the tax revenue from the planet.  The shortfall is covered by the governor personally, so typically it actually costs money to be a gov.

**Gadg8eer**:	Well, my current company is, in all likelihood, stuck in financial limbo with no way to climb out. Before I COLIQ, I thought I'd share the original end goal of and the reason for the weird name of my current company, "ToyWorks"; I was going to make FUNs and sell them.


[02-Jun-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	I'll deliver a shipment to @Anxiuz before I go, my sincere apologies to @Ravick for the unpayed loan but my numbers aren't going up fast enough.


[02-Jun-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	You should perhaps share that message with Ravick privately - he may be able/willing to help you.


[02-Jun-24 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Quitting is never the only option


[02-Jun-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	Fair enough. I know it's not meant to be easy, but unfortunately I made some interface mistakes early on that wasted large sums of money or resources.


[02-Jun-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	That, and my PC died two weeks ago and is still in the shop.


[02-Jun-24 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	So I'm only able to play PU now that I can borrow a laptop.


[02-Jun-24 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	Which caused even more issues and essentially made recovery impossible after 3 days.


[02-Jun-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	Currently my base is completely out of RAT and the ship at my base is out of fuel.


[02-Jun-24 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	The other ship is delivering that shipment and then I figure I'm better off trying again.


[02-Jun-24 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gadg8eer**:	That, and this time I actually have a busines plan.


[02-Jun-24 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	hopefully this time it's starting somewhere closer to the bottom of the production tree


[02-Jun-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Keep in mind, Coliq'ing with a loan might make it challenging to get a loan the second time around.


[02-Jun-24 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	had you considering demolishing the advanced buildings you have to reclaim the mats and build ext or col? There are options.....fuel and rats are easy to come by....and "wasted" purchases can be resold.


[02-Jun-24 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Or at least demolish everything and give as much cash back to Ravick as you can before you COLIQ - he is pretty reasonable and would understand the issues IRL.

**Gadg8eer**:	@Craftsmanthirteen Going to sell off all my assets and give all the proceeds to him, yes. He was very understanding and I want to ensure he knows this was in good faith.


[03-Jun-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rockyy**:	gotcha okay


[08-Jun-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rockyy**:	I chose manufactoring, but I'm starting to see why that might not have been a good choice for Prism. Should I COLIQ or try and make the best of it?


[08-Jun-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you're to limited to that field...that just determined your starting resources and experts....you're free to pursue any production/path you want


[08-Jun-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Prism CoGC is res ext, so you get a 25% efficiency boost in that area.


[08-Jun-24 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	slow starts are typical, though....if you choose to Coliq, take advantage of your time here now to learn and research and plan


[08-Jun-24 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you have a pro license, so shipping for others is a common source for extra revenue


[08-Jun-24 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rockyy**:	Okay gotcha. I built two HB1 and two BMP, should I demolish the BMP for something else?


[08-Jun-24 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	prism has SIO (requires extractor) and He (requires collector) as available natural resources


[08-Jun-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if you add LST to SIO at the BMP, it makes MCG which sells easily


[08-Jun-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	He sells easily as well without any processing.


[08-Jun-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rockyy**:	yeah that's what I'm producing right now, i have some being shipped to Moria Station right now


[08-Jun-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Incinerators are res ext buildings, you could buy GRN or HCP and burn them to produce C


[08-Jun-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rockyy**:	where would I go to ship for others?


[08-Jun-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jun-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zugore**:	there's one on most planets and all cx's


[08-Jun-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	My first month I spent in my starter field, but was doing shipping (lots of it)....now I've completely changed my build-outs and grown...no coliq. Get some contracts under your belt, and there are loans available to help you grow

**Zugore**:	I produce my own on Verdant


[24-Jun-24 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and where/when necessary, shop around


[24-Jun-24 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i dig water in montem and danakil. just sad that i cant compete anymore and have to sell to one same person every time


[24-Jun-24 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yields on those two planets are fairly low anyway...lots of better sources for water


[24-Jun-24 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i only have three planets


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I see that - I thought you had a larger presence based solely on your market activity, never really looked until now


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	ah


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	in danakil i make PT, O, DW, FIM, FOD, EPO, BBH, RBH, H2O, STL


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	and here, HE, SIO, LHP, NR and FLP


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i just don't support the 0.1$ flipping


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	margins tend to increase if you streamline....less production lines per base means more specialization but higher yields/market share


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yeah, he's the world's largest exporter/producer of water - so hard to avoid


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	pretty generous guy too


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	yeah i need to optimize my danakil base. FOD.NC1 no buyers for a long time, very low volume


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	In case the topic comes up again, there’s a difference between market making and forcing a monopoly


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	He’s actually ensuring a “floor” price for water producers while making sure there’s water for those who want to buy some


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	guess it depnds then on one's perspective


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	for water producers as in people who produce WITH water or people who produce said water?


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	both


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If it was forcing a monopoly, you’ll see the price falling over time until no one wants to produce any. He has kept the price stable for a long time so its not forcing a monopoly, at least not at this point


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	People who produce water


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	But it's forcing a trade market monopoly. I can't buy low and sell high. There's no fluctuation


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	For that, you have me to blame. I moved most of his MOR stock to HRT because I couldn’t stand IC1 water priced at 37-39


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	So I’m the one keeping HRT prices stable at 33 now.


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	oh well, i'll just have to find another resource to trade. just had my eyes set on H2O for over a year and now can't do anything


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and he's got three of the four markets if you've got HRT


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Markets change over time. If you were heavily invested in INS you’d be crying much more


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so, call it what you want, that's a darn monopoly


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i only use NC1


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	i try to do low volume trading, low risk and short time


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**babipoki**:	so prices falling like that wont affect me


[24-Jun-24 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We each play our own style. Me, I just look out for my HRTians.


[24-Jun-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and he's looking out for his Martians - notice his MOR prices are in line with your HRT rates, but his rates in BEN and ANT are 2 points lower


[24-Jun-24 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	BEN and ANT is cheeper for most items.


[24-Jun-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	Mine are stopped already.


[24-Jun-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the one I'm waiting on was supposed to deliver yesterday - but he has IRL stuff going on - so why on earth he committed to that delvery schedule (or I wanted to believe it would be ok) who the heck knows


[24-Jun-24 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have 58 grn and 16 hcp on site....then you should prolly alter your incinerator numbers or buy more

[24-Jun-24 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	generally run a 9h combo


[24-Jun-24 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i have 30 INC here 12 farm on verdant equals 30INC nearly. left over GRN goes to FER.


[24-Jun-24 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have 2k


[24-Jun-24 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	no farms on verdant - just hyf


[24-Jun-24 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	hcp and caf


[24-Jun-24 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	@shaitr - that 0.40 gap above you is all he needs to capitalize and overtake your market - drop in a sell order at @33.40 and buy out your 100k at 33.00 - and your market is no longer safe


[24-Jun-24 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and I think we both know he has the means to do it


[24-Jun-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yea well I’m still holding on to quite a large amount of H2O so we shall see. Anyway I don’t think he’s in this for money, and neither am I. We’re probably at a point where more money is not meaningful. For me, I’m just trying to make sure there’s a supply of reasonably priced water at HRT


[24-Jun-24 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you can do that easily (as can he) without monopolizing the market - pick your safe price point and put in your sell order.....leave the bid market alone - that allows for smaller producers to sell as well.


[24-Jun-24 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you are both in effect controlling the market - no one can buy or sell at the cx without buying from you or selling to you.


[24-Jun-24 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats not market stabilization


[24-Jun-24 07:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thats monopolizing the market


[24-Jun-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Quantox**:	hi, when this morning my ships arrived back at base from their first cx trip, i realised i have 14 BSE and not the 16 i need, is there a way that i can buy 2 BSE somewhere closer than the cx?


[25-Jun-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Unfortunately not as you're on Free license.


[25-Jun-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quantox**:	oh, ok


[25-Jun-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	In case you do get PRO licence in future, you will be able to put up local market ads on the planet board, post here that you need the BSE, and those who can fill it will do so


[25-Jun-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quantox**:	ill look into getting PRO, are there any other benefits other than trading on local markets?


[25-Jun-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The biggest thing for me is the recurring orders


[25-Jun-24 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	PRO also allows you to upgrade/build ships, and fly more than 2 at the same time.


[25-Jun-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I can't get the wiki to load, but you'll probably be able to find a more comprehensive list of benefits by googling it


[25-Jun-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quantox**:	okay, thanks for the help! :)


[25-Jun-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Quantox**:	ok, i now have a pro licence and i put up a buy order for 2 BSE :)


[25-Jun-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jun-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	GOV: we are losing technicians - unemployment is down to 6.5% - I think we need to up the health POPI - or add comfort to increase their happiness -


[08-Jul-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah, that's the point


[08-Jul-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	you run programs when it gets low


[08-Jul-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	and then it bleeds out for the next 8 weeks


[08-Jul-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**lowstrife**:	yeah there are a whole bunch of different ways of accomplishing it too


[08-Jul-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but yeah this one has been pretty good, to keep taxes as low as they are. it's a simple planet, but those techs are just about big enough to where they would need comfort tbh

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I've been trying to balance the POPI and CoGC expenses while maintaining the current tax rates. We should be fine for the next 2 weeks or so, but this is becoming harder as the prices of the inputs increase everywhere.


[20-Oct-24 12:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Just letting y'all know first since we may have to raise taxes, especially for the SET and TEC populations.


[20-Oct-24 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Noticed you're filling filling all 3 upkeeps for the SST, but keeping it at 3/4 level. Would it not be cheaper to run it at max with only 2 upkeeps? I'll bring in an upgrade so you can run 2 upkeeps on 5 if that won't be enough.


[20-Oct-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	2 upkeeps on 5 would be same price as 3 on 3


[20-Oct-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It does turn out to be cheaper that way. In any case, I'm capping SST at L1 for the next 2 weeks to get rid of the excess SETs.


[20-Oct-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I didn't want to use taxes to upgrade the SSTs


[20-Oct-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I meant I'll done the upgrade


[20-Oct-24 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I've done that across many planets


[20-Oct-24 12:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	donate*


[20-Oct-24 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Actually if someone has TRU here they can complete it right now


[20-Oct-24 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That would be useful when we are in a more stable phase - i.e. when the SET population is more under control


[20-Oct-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	More SST is always more efficient. Only problem is gov can't control which upkeeps are used if they're all filled.


[20-Oct-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	So once the more expensive upkeeps have gone through their buffer it'll be cheaper to run.


[20-Oct-24 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	No matter what level it needs to be set at


[20-Oct-24 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tychoid**:	Hey, I'm quite new in the game. This mechanic is not yet known to me. When will the taxes have to be paid and how will they be paid? And how can we take part in the project?


[20-Oct-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	production fees are taken out of your account automatically every time a new production starts, if you don't have funds to cover the production fee, it won't start. Re planetary projects and upkeep, don't worry about that, just build your empire, the older players/govt will take care of those things


[20-Oct-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tychoid**:	ah, cool! Yea, I recognized the production fee but for me it is still ver low, almost not noticeable. Probably will increase for the more complex production chains, right?


[20-Oct-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	prod fee is based on the population type used (and the time required to complete the production).


[20-Oct-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	per the prod fee settings by the local government, found here: LR OT-889a


[20-Oct-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	^ type that into a new buffer (the link as it exists there is just the planet - though you can find it there as Local Rules)


[20-Oct-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tychoid**:	thanks for the infos! I will read into that

**Retread**:	That's exactly how it goes.  Eventually, you'll have some stuff to sell, and you fly it to Moria Station.  With the income, you'll buy more supplies and after a few more trips, some construction materials to expand your production line.  Eventually, you'll fill up your base and try to figure out when and how to establish a second one.  And a third one.  And so on.

**Groknik**:	yea im sending one ship to moria right now to pick up the next round of materials because its a long flight

**MrPoncho**:	how can i deal to get some materials


[29-Apr-25 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Welcome. You have to fly to the nearest CX (Commodity eXchange) where you can sell and buy materials


[29-Apr-25 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	first check your ships cargo bays


[29-Apr-25 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you can to find some b-fabs there


[29-Apr-25 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	I recommend you to take a help missions - help menu on the right top


[29-Apr-25 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yup just follow the tutorial


[29-Apr-25 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	And if anything doesn't make sense, ask in chats


[29-Apr-25 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Hmmm.... MrPoncho, 934 days ago. Smells like a troll )))


[29-Apr-25 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	There are some accounts that were created a while ago, but only start to play now


[29-Apr-25 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	That's not the first time I'm seeing this


[29-Apr-25 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	as I know, free inactive users are deleted in 30 d


[29-Apr-25 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I don't think the accounts are deleted - their bases are.


[29-Apr-25 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Hmm...


[29-Apr-25 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	oh thxs guys, i was a long time ago here, but i only install and started the game, and it was only in english, and im a swiss guy and prefer german in such complex games. my english arent that good


[29-Apr-25 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i follow the turtorial, my fault was i started as producer, and i think miner would be better.


[29-Apr-25 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i craft some PE and MCG and try to sell it on the market and also get the comodetis from there


[29-Apr-25 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	is this chat only for people from planet prism?


[29-Apr-25 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Apr-25 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, good thing translations are a thing now :)


[29-Apr-25 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Your manufacturer profession was not a bad pick I'd say, but yeah, Prism gives bonus for resource extraction


[29-Apr-25 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Not that you've completely screwed up or something, you are just missing on some bonuses that will speed you up a bit


[29-Apr-25 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Fortunatelly, you can always start over


[29-Apr-25 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-25 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	definitely do the tutorials


[30-Apr-25 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Game time equals real time - so it's slow at the beginning


[30-Apr-25 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
