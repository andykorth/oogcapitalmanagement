@everyone If anyone needs C, I have 146 lying around and such. I'll also deliver it to you if your on another planet or something.


[24-Dec-21 04:59 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I'll be selling it all if nobody want them in about 1 week.


[24-Dec-21 05:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

8k contract from antares IIg to ANT on ANT LM


[26-Dec-21 08:29 AM] domicius#0000
I don't think I'll get to it on time. My boats are 3 days out from ant2g. Thanks for the heads up tho, if its still on I'll check it out


[26-Dec-21 08:31 AM] dasefx1#0000
thanks 🙂 with next popolous report I should adding more and more contracts


[26-Dec-21 08:58 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@dasefx1 How about this: I have a ship on Nike for a LST pickup. If you change the contract to 326 H I can transport it to ANT for just 3k.


[26-Dec-21 08:59 AM] spatial_piano#0000
That way I can fit 174 LST with it


[26-Dec-21 08:59 AM] dasefx1#0000
antares g II mostly take 200 SF one side, so it will be unprofitable for you 🙂


[26-Dec-21 09:00 AM] dasefx1#0000
as landing cost a lot SF


[26-Dec-21 09:00 AM] dasefx1#0000
so I can change but I propose higher price 😄


[26-Dec-21 09:01 AM] dasefx1#0000
landing avg is 120 SF


[26-Dec-21 09:01 AM] dasefx1#0000
and starting same


[26-Dec-21 09:03 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I did the math. Landing approach and tkaeoff seem to be about 276 ther and back. SF is around 8 in-corp,  so my profit comes to about 700, which I think covers for any unforseen costs.


[26-Dec-21 09:05 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Of course I'm not gonna decline extra money.

[26-Dec-21 09:13 AM] dasefx1#0000
ok so I will chenge contract for 5k 🙂


[26-Dec-21 09:13 AM] spatial_piano#0000
You drive a hard bargain, but I'll take it


[26-Dec-21 09:13 AM] dasefx1#0000
listed thanks 😄


[26-Dec-21 09:22 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok. Pick up in about 5 hours, drop off within 24h of that.


[26-Dec-21 09:22 AM] dasefx1#0000
excellent thanks 🙂


[26-Dec-21 03:04 PM] spatial_piano#0000
If somebody happens to have a ship with nothing to do, there are plenty of gas shipping contracts from KI-401 by Madnewmy. Since he needs both AR and H shipped, there is an opportunity to make up 17k for one trip if you negotiate separate contracts with Mad. Normally you'd get 12k for a full ship of one material, but 229 H and 271 AR fit into one ship (500m3/499,494t), and their total equivalent reward would be around the previously mentioned 17k.


[26-Dec-21 03:39 PM] domicius#0000
Good idea.


[27-Dec-21 02:30 PM] dasefx1#0000
shipping of antares IIg to phobos on phobos LM  🙂


[28-Dec-21 06:56 AM] insensless72#0000
LST is a 10k flip rn. Ill sell full ship (183) for 6k in corp. Its going 110ea on market


[28-Dec-21 06:26 PM] domicius#0000
Sure! Can you do on Phobos?


[28-Dec-21 06:28 PM] domicius#0000
Or if its Deimos I can flya ship over


[28-Dec-21 06:31 PM] insensless72#0000
Nike actually, I cant fly it cause my ships are in use. Feel free to come get as much as you want


[28-Dec-21 06:31 PM] insensless72#0000
i have 1000 to spare


[28-Dec-21 06:42 PM] domicius#0000
My ships are busy until tomorrow, but if you put up an advert for a shipload or 2 or 3 I'll warehouse it. Need me to ship anything over from Antares or Phobos?


[28-Dec-21 06:43 PM] domicius#0000
I can't afford more than that right now.


[28-Dec-21 06:46 PM] insensless72#0000
Not currently, thanks though!


[28-Dec-21 06:46 PM] insensless72#0000
just let me know if you want any LST


[28-Dec-21 06:54 PM] domicius#0000
Ill put up an advert on Nike for a few boatloadss
How's 549@18000?


[28-Dec-21 06:54 PM] insensless72#0000
it has to be 183 at a time


[28-Dec-21 06:57 PM] domicius#0000
Geez, a warehouse unit is 2k!


[28-Dec-21 06:57 PM] domicius#0000
On Nike


[28-Dec-21 06:58 PM] insensless72#0000
Yup, and one unit only hold 183 LST i believe


[28-Dec-21 07:00 PM] insensless72#0000
Hold on, now that you mention it, I didnt realize that it was that expensive on Nike


[28-Dec-21 07:04 PM] domicius#0000
Yup. I guess the governor is making money!


[28-Dec-21 07:05 PM] domicius#0000
Still might be worth it - let me get my ships into dock so I can get some cash in, and see how many shipments I can make in a week.


[28-Dec-21 07:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Nike -> ANT is around 9-10hs, which means with return you could at least fit in 6 trips. Which is how many you would need to buy all 1000 lol


[28-Dec-21 07:11 PM] insensless72#0000
That being said you dont have to buy any, its just always an option for anyone in corp


[28-Dec-21 07:15 PM] domicius#0000
Im making MCG, so I'll totally buy it


[28-Dec-21 07:16 PM] domicius#0000
Just nwed to sell some MCG to get cash to buy the LST, and then start my runs.


[28-Dec-21 07:16 PM] insensless72#0000
Sounds good!


[28-Dec-21 07:17 PM] domicius#0000
Talk to you tomorrow :) (it's 0100 here in the UK)


[28-Dec-21 07:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Does anyone have things to ship from phobos to ANT?


[28-Dec-21 07:18 PM] domicius#0000
A small amount of MCG?


[28-Dec-21 07:19 PM] domicius#0000
200u


[28-Dec-21 07:19 PM] spatial_piano#0000
200 fits easy.


[28-Dec-21 07:19 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I have about 200 t empty  space


[28-Dec-21 07:19 PM] domicius#0000
100 AIC?


[28-Dec-21 07:20 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm fine with less. I have to go soon and the space will be ampty regardless


[28-Dec-21 07:23 PM] domicius#0000
Ta muchly!


[31-Dec-21 05:31 AM] dasefx1#0000
8k contract from antares IIg to ANT on ANT LM


[01-Jan-22 05:40 PM] insensless72#0000
Flying CX -> Nike tomorrow if you need anything shipped. Plenty of room


[03-Jan-22 10:45 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Just sold 183 LST @85 AIC over the course of 2 days. looks like we are stabilizing (for now) at higher limestone prices

@sackless_jack @megasaberexe @spoooperz 

Do either of you want to do a deimos round trip shipment for me?


[03-Jan-22 07:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Oh, wait, @domicius said to wait 2 days for this shipment, 4 days ago 😮


[03-Jan-22 07:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Anyways, I still need it done, and will pay 10,000 AIC in corp for the round trip 500t


[04-Jan-22 04:12 AM] domicius#0000
The immediate reply beneath me was that somebody would else could do it... Currently engaged in shipping stuff for new base :(


[04-Jan-22 10:57 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats good! good to have busy ships and new bases to worry about


[04-Jan-22 06:53 PM] insensless72#0000
Does anyone know the current shipping rate outside of corp?


[04-Jan-22 07:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
round trip ANT to KI sector is about 12k.


[04-Jan-22 07:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ANT to local planet surface is about 2/ton


[04-Jan-22 07:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe 3/ton


[04-Jan-22 07:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ive seen one way ANT to BEN at 8-9kbut i dont know if that is competitive or what


[04-Jan-22 07:22 PM] insensless72#0000
I just meant if i wanted to post a shipping contract for someone to take my ALO to the CX from Deimos, what would be a fair offer


[04-Jan-22 07:22 PM] insensless72#0000
299/500t


[04-Jan-22 07:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
for full shipment, do a pretend flight to ANT from Deimos (without actually launching) to view the fuel cost


[04-Jan-22 07:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
use this to estimate total fuel cost and then add like 1000-1500 on top of this to make it competitive


[04-Jan-22 07:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
in this case it is 1 jump with 500t, so a net profit of 1000 would be 2/ton which is pretty close to the standard rate


[04-Jan-22 08:25 PM] insensless72#0000
Sweet, thanks!


[05-Jan-22 10:25 AM] domicius#0000
Bear in mind that shipping costs vary based on plenatary mechanics.


[05-Jan-22 01:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea precisely why i do a pretend flight to test the real fuel cost before posting.


[05-Jan-22 01:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i suppose there can also be a large duration flight time to go to an outer orbit gas planet, so this would also factor in


[07-Jan-22 04:40 AM] domicius#0000
I wanted to add - you can also test a flight from anywhere to anywhere at any time by creating a blueprint BLU, and then "testing" it. Make sure it's a "standard" ship all the way, just in case.


[13-Jan-22 05:27 AM] dasefx1#0000
two ANT II g to ANT ads on ANT LM 8k each


[15-Jan-22 01:01 PM] kharadan#0000
I have a mostly empty ship at Hortus just waiting for a good opportunity to get back to ANT. Let me know if you have anything for that route


[15-Jan-22 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
mm, I have never traded in the hortus area or currency


[15-Jan-22 01:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I occasionally go to benten


[15-Jan-22 01:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i think the benten economy is better than hortus.


[15-Jan-22 01:04 PM] kharadan#0000
there was a good price for selling PE in HRT, that's how I ended there this time
and cheap FF


[15-Jan-22 01:20 PM] dasefx1#0000
I bought once on contract 100 CAF on hortus, and next day waiting for fullfill I saw that someone liqiudate account :/ so I don't like Hortus 😄


[17-Jan-22 12:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone if you have an idle ship and 200 FF, I have a 12k round trip job to KI-401b for you.


[18-Jan-22 01:26 AM] kharadan#0000
going ANT > Deimos with 130 m/t free, anyone has anything to take?
I'll be leaving in about 30 min if I don't hear anything


[18-Jan-22 01:26 AM] kharadan#0000
I'll have another ship going like this tomorrow morning CET


[19-Jan-22 11:42 AM] domicius#0000

[19-Jan-22 11:44 AM] domicius#0000
Anyone flying NIKE to Phobos/ANT1?


[19-Jan-22 12:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I always make that flight 100% full with limestone


[19-Jan-22 12:59 PM] insensless72#0000
same unfortunately


[19-Jan-22 01:31 PM] domicius#0000
What would you offer for someone transport that load (shipping contract)?


[19-Jan-22 01:36 PM] insensless72#0000
If youre going to ship it, its honestly more profitable to flip it. Its a 10k flip rn if you buy at 6k and sell at 100ea


[19-Jan-22 02:41 PM] domicius#0000
I make MCG, so make 20k on it


[19-Jan-22 02:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yep. Normally I would offer 4-5k to ship this, but its so close i normally ship it myself


[19-Jan-22 02:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
New players make good shipping partners, since they often have spare shipping capacity, one base, and not enough money to flip entire shiploads


[19-Jan-22 02:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you are looking for somebody to ship for you, i would start advertising 5k paychecks to newbies


[19-Jan-22 02:43 PM] domicius#0000
Fuel is so expensive right now, you have to fly slow to make money on shipping


[19-Jan-22 02:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
planet-to-planet on 3-day delivery *should* be profitable on 5000aic. Maybe the market has moved drastically beneath me again


[20-Jan-22 04:00 AM] domicius#0000
Next time one of you is thinking shipping LST to A1C or Phobos, let me know and I will pay the market rate for the LST.


[20-Jan-22 08:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am flying Phobos -> Nike in 24 hours.


[20-Jan-22 08:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will ship free for anyone and fill the remaining cargo space with SIO.

planning to go in the next 1-2 hours


[27-Jan-22 11:33 AM] namthorn#0000
Got nothing to go there but I'd take a small amount of shipping back to deimos, unless you're planning on being completely full on the way back.


[27-Jan-22 11:36 AM] namthorn#0000
would be 1.2t/18m^3. np if not, I'll just grab it later and fill the rest of my ship with LST


[27-Jan-22 12:06 PM] artokun#0000
i'll be pretty light i think, i'll have room


[27-Jan-22 12:06 PM] artokun#0000
won't know until i get there though


[27-Jan-22 01:16 PM] namthorn#0000
ok, just give me a poke when you know one way or the other

Flying Nike -> Deimos today with about 400t of space left


[28-Jan-22 12:48 PM] artokun#0000
I'm also going Deimos to CX shortly after that so it could be an indirect route


[28-Jan-22 12:48 PM] insensless72#0000
Will you fly some BSE to Nike for me?


[28-Jan-22 12:48 PM] insensless72#0000

[28-Jan-22 01:30 PM] artokun#0000
would save me a trip if you bring it to Deimos


[28-Jan-22 01:30 PM] artokun#0000
hopefully I can sell within 12 hours~


[28-Jan-22 01:31 PM] kharadan#0000

[28-Jan-22 05:44 PM] namthorn#0000
Wasn't planning on it but I can take it tomorrow and just load up on LST for the return journey if its still available. Just need enough to cover the fuel and ship degradation.


[28-Jan-22 05:45 PM] insensless72#0000
Sounds good to me, you can buy the LST from me or just about anyone else located on Nike


[28-Jan-22 05:46 PM] namthorn#0000
Ye works for me. Will grab the ad tomorrow morning UK time if its still up


[30-Jan-22 04:48 AM] kharadan#0000

[03-Feb-22 01:35 PM] kharadan#0000
~~not that I have anything to ship, but isn't the corporate policy to prefer Nike LM?~~


[03-Feb-22 01:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh lol, thanks for the reminder


[03-Feb-22 01:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I wasnt thinking about it. updating my message

Im flying Nike -> CX for once I have 445t available


[05-Feb-22 12:05 PM] insensless72#0000
let me know if you need anything shipped. Ill be leaving in about 6hrs


[05-Feb-22 02:37 PM] spatial_piano#0000
There's always LST. 445t fits 163 of them.


[06-Feb-22 11:13 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Ship leaving Deimos -> Phobos in the next few hours, 350t space available. Let me know if you want anything added


[06-Feb-22 11:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday I will load you up with ALO with any leftover space, if you dont mind


[06-Feb-22 11:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe somebody else wants to get a specific thing in before I hog all of the space, though.


[06-Feb-22 11:17 AM] yjhasaday#0000
@bitcoin_ape Sounds good, we'll give it an hour or so to see if anyone else needs something shipped, I'll dm you when I'm leaving 🙂


[07-Feb-22 01:28 AM] kharadan#0000
Anyone need any shipping ANT > Deimos?
310 t / 385m3 free
not in rush to leave


[07-Feb-22 01:33 PM] artokun#0000
Anyone need a ship from Phobos > Deimos?


[07-Feb-22 01:33 PM] artokun#0000
i'll leave when I have a full ship


[07-Feb-22 03:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@artokun I see a paid offer from CoolAir on Phobos LM for this same flight.


[07-Feb-22 03:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Could help you fill the ship faster


[07-Feb-22 03:43 PM] insensless72#0000
Planning a ship Nike > Harmonia, will have plenty of room on the return trip here in a day or so


[07-Feb-22 03:45 PM] allocater#0000
no point in shipping my partial construction material yet, I guess, but on the return you can pick up GRN,HCP,DW,RAT that Nike wants


[07-Feb-22 04:05 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill haul back anything you need me to


[07-Feb-22 04:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Actually, I didnt realize GRN is so heavy. I already have 350t committed. Ill keep you posted @allocater as to how much space ill have

{Reactions}
👍 

[08-Feb-22 09:57 AM] insensless72#0000
@allocater I have 251t available for shipping off Harmonia. Ship is headed Harmonia > Nike or Deimos


[08-Feb-22 11:10 AM] allocater#0000
ok, 235t shipping to nike created


[08-Feb-22 11:39 AM] artokun#0000
I have an empty ship Nike > Deimos


[08-Feb-22 09:13 PM] artokun#0000
Still empty, feels like a waste to leave empty


[08-Feb-22 09:14 PM] artokun#0000
also I don't need a ship just yet, eventually I will leave, even empty


[08-Feb-22 09:14 PM] insensless72#0000
I have some something you could take


[08-Feb-22 09:14 PM] insensless72#0000
it isnt much though


[08-Feb-22 09:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Cant you load up with LST and sell it for more money on Deimos?


[08-Feb-22 09:15 PM] artokun#0000
I would have but can't afford it


[08-Feb-22 09:15 PM] artokun#0000
spent it all on food and water


[08-Feb-22 09:16 PM] artokun#0000
and paying back stuff


[08-Feb-22 09:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
let me see who has the BMPs on Deimos


[08-Feb-22 09:17 PM] artokun#0000
but you can buy it, and i'll carry it over there for you to sell


[08-Feb-22 09:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kharadan


[08-Feb-22 09:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Here is a chance for you to get an LST shipment if you are looking for such a thing


[08-Feb-22 09:18 PM] artokun#0000
put it up on the shipping channel


[12-Feb-22 03:28 PM] kharadan#0000
I'll be going Deimos > Nike in about 10 hours
100 t free


[12-Feb-22 03:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@kharadan if you can load up 100t of AL somehow, I would buy it from you at a higher price


[12-Feb-22 03:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also I can provide money up front.


[12-Feb-22 03:44 PM] kharadan#0000
I don't gave AL for sale, sorry


[12-Feb-22 03:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
worth a try 😅


[12-Feb-22 03:44 PM] kharadan#0000
:)


[12-Feb-22 07:02 PM] artokun#0000
Lemme know next time you need AL I just shipped off 185AL to the CX


[12-Feb-22 07:03 PM] artokun#0000
AL and TI is all I do, plus DW and RAT soon


[12-Feb-22 07:35 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Ship going from ANT CX -> Phobos then -> Deimos, leaving in about 4 hours. 250t/300m available, let me know if anyone wants something moved!


[13-Feb-22 04:36 AM] allocater#0000
this is 100 GRN for the deimos carbon base that can be taken from the station the next time someone flies:

[14-Feb-22 07:59 AM] cazertanu#0000
I have an empty ship going to KI-401d from Antaras station. Anybody need something shipped there from the exchange?


[14-Feb-22 08:02 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think we don't have player with base there :/


[14-Feb-22 08:06 AM] cazertanu#0000
Thanks for letting me know. There is this swift company on planet that exports atleast 4 full ships worth of gas a week. I make a 📈 profit going one way.


[14-Feb-22 08:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
true 😉 you can always take my contracts from ant II g with H as well, as I pay less but you can round more contracts in same time


[14-Feb-22 08:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
as from ant II g to ant is around 8h fly


[14-Feb-22 08:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
I always put my contratcs on ANT LM


[14-Feb-22 08:37 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Empty ship leaving Nike -> Deimos in an hour. Anyone need any LST moved?


[14-Feb-22 12:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@Deimos @Phobos 

I need some help with Nike shipments. I have reserve fuel on Phobos if this helps at all, and I can provision the shipments right away.

500 tons shipped from Deimos to Nike
100 tons shipped from Phobos to Nike


[14-Feb-22 12:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can pay 6500 AIC for both shipments


[14-Feb-22 12:25 PM] dasefx1#0000
phobos to nike, you can list for 1 AIC and I will take tomorrow morning to nike


[14-Feb-22 12:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thanks, it is 3 contracts but the weight is not so bad. I will post them now


[14-Feb-22 12:25 PM] dasefx1#0000
sure let me know when ready


[14-Feb-22 12:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
posted on Nike LM @dasefx1 . less than 70t


[14-Feb-22 12:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also my Deimos shipment is still up on Nike for 6000 AIC. I can do a different price if anyone here is able to take it


[14-Feb-22 12:31 PM] namthorn#0000
I can do it tomorrow if no one snaps it up today, currently flying back from ANT IIb atm


[14-Feb-22 01:43 PM] domicius#0000
I can run to Nike too, pick up some LST


[15-Feb-22 06:41 AM] kharadan#0000
Deimos > ANT in 18 hours, 400 t free


[15-Feb-22 10:15 AM] domicius#0000
I'll buy any LST you can run.


[15-Feb-22 10:31 AM] kharadan#0000
Are you going to Nike?
I would have some stuff to ship there and on the way back you could take LST. I expect to have a shipload Thursday morning CET


[15-Feb-22 11:13 AM] domicius#0000
Doh, i already shipped to Nike. But I'll do a round trip again tomorrow if you want


[15-Feb-22 11:14 AM] domicius#0000
Phobos - Nike trip


[15-Feb-22 11:15 AM] kharadan#0000
I think I'll go on my own then
but good news for you, I'm bringing materials to expand my extractors there, which will allow me to make close to one shipload of LST per day

[15-Feb-22 11:16 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[15-Feb-22 11:19 AM] kharadan#0000
in that case 
Deimos > Nike in 14 hours 50 t free

I have a ship at ANT. I want to use it to move a full ship worth of supplies for the clan. I don't know what the first leg should be. I can buy up to $15000 of supplies for process at the pickup point. Sorry for complicated language. " I can pickup something from the store for you before I haul your freight to the third planet.


[15-Feb-22 06:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Hey caz, we can find a good route for you, give me an hour or two to finish work and get caught up on the logistics


[15-Feb-22 06:03 PM] cazertanu#0000
Sounds great to me.


[16-Feb-22 02:10 PM] allocater#0000
there is some crazy shipping ads from harmonia to deimos 😲


[16-Feb-22 05:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I  posted an ad for 30t Phobos->Nike. If anyone is going that route soon I'd appreciate if you could haul it.


[17-Feb-22 09:00 AM] domicius#0000
I think someone picked it up. Im also flying Phobos-Nike soon if anyone needs any carriage


[17-Feb-22 03:51 PM] cazertanu#0000

[19-Feb-22 02:26 PM] cazertanu#0000
I have i have 400 tons and 400 M^3 free on a ship on Nike going to Demos. Anybody have more they want to move


[19-Feb-22 02:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
maybe @kharadan has LST?


[19-Feb-22 02:28 PM] kharadan#0000
I'll have a shipload on Monday. I need to fulfil existing contracts first


[20-Feb-22 11:23 AM] allocater#0000
Does anyone want something shipped from Benton? My ship is there, but I would need CIS wire, so I can buy something for you.


[20-Feb-22 11:30 AM] domicius#0000

[20-Feb-22 03:26 PM] allocater#0000
I can send a ship, after I upgraded my Harmonia HQ


[20-Feb-22 03:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the flight is quite cheap


[20-Feb-22 03:27 PM] allocater#0000
is he paying shipping or selling it locally?


[20-Feb-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
selling locally is best i think


[20-Feb-22 03:28 PM] allocater#0000
I open a warehouse and make an AD then


[20-Feb-22 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
he needs free shipping badly it seems, so that is the only real choice


[20-Feb-22 03:33 PM] domicius#0000
I'm not sure there's a strong return on AI1


[20-Feb-22 03:33 PM] allocater#0000
lets see if he sells a shipload for 30k


[20-Feb-22 03:33 PM] domicius#0000
Unless you can negotiate him down under 25k a  shipload

Well that's different


[20-Feb-22 03:36 PM] allocater#0000
also, he is the market manipulator who bought up all DW below 75 and then is selling it at 75!

I didn't know there were people on Vanilla Ice planet.


[20-Feb-22 05:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@allocater @domicius try for a very low price


[20-Feb-22 05:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you deserve a discount by doing all shipping


[20-Feb-22 05:25 PM] domicius#0000
I'll check it out :)


[20-Feb-22 11:12 PM] allocater#0000
omg, he is selling at 8! I'm gonna need another loan from the bank to buy up all the water


[21-Feb-22 05:25 AM] kharadan#0000
if anyone goes from ANT > Deimos, let me know
I can fill you up


[21-Feb-22 05:34 AM] kharadan#0000
also I'll be going to Harmonia in couple days, I can bring you non-edible consumables


[21-Feb-22 11:43 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you dont make your pioneers eat the overalls?


[21-Feb-22 11:46 AM] kharadan#0000
they need to eat?

😆 

[21-Feb-22 11:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
earthing's harmonia base is pretty well stocked for all consumables. perhaps allocater, insensless, or artokun would be interested


[21-Feb-22 12:42 PM] allocater#0000
I will run out of COF OVE PWO in 4 days, would indeed be great if I don't have to send a ship to restock


[21-Feb-22 12:49 PM] kharadan#0000
I expect to be there Thursday evening CET. Will that work for you, or should I speed the ship up?


[21-Feb-22 12:54 PM] allocater#0000
I thought the idea is to transfer between harmonia bases. Don't stress on my account 🙂


[21-Feb-22 12:56 PM] kharadan#0000
I'm suppplying my base, so I can bring stuff for yours as well. Just tell me the deadline, provision goods for me and I'll take it


[21-Feb-22 12:58 PM] kharadan#0000
I can also take them from ANT. OVE and PWO I produce, so I can sell you directly


[21-Feb-22 01:11 PM] allocater#0000
thursday evening should work. So I would buy 50 50 20 COF OVE PWO in Harmonia LM and you bring or produce it?


[21-Feb-22 02:36 PM] cazertanu#0000
I have an empty ship in Nike. Can we organize a full load to one plannet?


[21-Feb-22 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes @cazertanu


[21-Feb-22 02:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
where do you want to go? shipping LST from Nike to Phobos works well.


[21-Feb-22 03:21 PM] kharadan#0000
I can get you
OVE - 50/u
PWO - 120/u
COF - CX price, I don't produce it myself


[21-Feb-22 07:36 PM] cazertanu#0000
that sounds good to me


[22-Feb-22 12:09 AM] domicius#0000
I have a load of LST on Nike I need bringing to Phobos


[22-Feb-22 10:29 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Ship with 300t of space leaving ANT -> Phobos in 3 hours. Then going Phobos -> Deimos right after. Let me know if any of you want anything moved to Phobos or Deimos

[24-Feb-22 10:35 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can also accept a delivery on phobos or deimos. Whichever one works for the shipper.


[24-Feb-22 10:38 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Another new option is to buy 500t directly on my new LM 😄 

This helps me in the same way, I need to get inventory off planet.

long way to go for 84 FEO 😂


[24-Feb-22 11:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thats why the price is so low 😬


[24-Feb-22 11:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i can go lower though


[24-Feb-22 11:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
shit, i would give FEO almost for free in corp


[24-Feb-22 11:46 AM] namthorn#0000
nah it's more that i wonder the efficacy of FEO there, maybe if there was processing facilities nearby to shrink it down


[24-Feb-22 11:49 AM] namthorn#0000
as, for example you can get FEO from ZV-759b for ~3-4k a shipload


[24-Feb-22 11:56 AM] dasefx1#0000
antares 2 b FEO is much better


[24-Feb-22 11:56 AM] dasefx1#0000
FEO is product not worth it to transport more than same system close planet


[24-Feb-22 11:56 AM] dasefx1#0000
even than it is avg business


[24-Feb-22 11:57 AM] dasefx1#0000
FEO best is when is smelt to FE, and change for sth 🙂


[24-Feb-22 11:57 AM] dasefx1#0000
maybe do UTS ? light and MM on CX


[24-Feb-22 12:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I already smelt FE on KI-401b to make it worthwhile for shipping


[24-Feb-22 12:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Selling FEO out there is not a real business model, but I have it basically for free so I post


[24-Feb-22 12:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this FE is consumed by my PP1 and by ASM on deimos to make FAL

I don't have a ship available now, but I can make a trip in a week or so. I rented a WAR and put up an ad as well, I figure I'll fly out and pick it up when my ship is free then sell it back to you after moving it back here minus the shipping fee? Where do you want it to go?


[13-Apr-22 07:05 PM] insensless72#0000
Ship headed Nike-> Deimos in 21hrs, empty as of now, let me know if you need anything moved


[13-Apr-22 11:31 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I have an ad on Nike LM, think you could take it for me? Also I grabbed the ones you have from Phobos->Nike, should be there in about 12 hours


[14-Apr-22 05:33 AM] yang_mills#0000
Ship departing Phobos ->Harmonia in 10h. At least 300t/300m^3 left. Does anyone need shipping? Also take ads for Phobos ->Deimos, since the ship will fly to Deimos after Harmonia. @insensless72 , I've seen your ad for Phobos->Deimos and will probably take it.


[14-Apr-22 07:51 AM] insensless72#0000
@yjhasaday grabbed it, thanks though. I will need shipping from Harmonia > Deimos most likely, if you have room in that flight


[14-Apr-22 08:44 AM] yang_mills#0000
I will let you know.

Does anyone have a ship flying ANT -> Phobos?


[15-Apr-22 08:15 AM] yang_mills#0000
Would need to transport a small shipment of 10 HOG for the POPI upkeep on Phobos.


[15-Apr-22 08:17 AM] allocater#0000
yes I fly it daily, just put up the shipping


[15-Apr-22 08:17 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, I'm doing that run later today too


[15-Apr-22 08:25 AM] yang_mills#0000
The idea is to buy 20 HOG on the CX, ship it to Phobos, and donate it to the art gallery there. It would be simpler if you do all yourself. I can share costs with you. 20 HOG is 60K. I can give 30K for that if you place a sell order 1 DW @ 30K on Phobos.


[15-Apr-22 08:34 AM] allocater#0000
ok, I will also test if he sells the HOG right on the phobos LM


[15-Apr-22 08:37 AM] yang_mills#0000
Let me know when you want me to post the sell ad.


[15-Apr-22 08:39 AM] allocater#0000
I posted 2 ads on phobos


[15-Apr-22 08:43 AM] yang_mills#0000
Paid you 30K AIC. Now you have to deliver 10 HOG for the ART on Phobos.

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Apr-22 08:59 AM] yang_mills#0000
@rune_242 You made a mistake. You posted a shipping ad Nike-> Deimos that fills the whole cargo. If you split it into two shipments of half the size, for half the price each, you will have a much easier time to find someone to ship it.


[15-Apr-22 09:02 AM] yang_mills#0000
Because then someone who has some cargo space left can pick one ad, and would not need to fly Nike->Deimos on purpose just for your shipment.


[15-Apr-22 09:04 AM] yang_mills#0000
I regularly do the trip Nike->Deimos, because I transport my own stuff, but also usually have some free cargo space left.


[15-Apr-22 10:05 AM] yang_mills#0000
@yjhasaday @allocater Ship Harmonia -> Deimos completely full. Did not take any shipping ad. Sorry.

if nobody is willing or able, I will be posting it on Phobos LM for A-rated companies


[17-Apr-22 04:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For a partial shipment, around 200-300t, I would pay slightly less, around 40k AIC.


[17-Apr-22 04:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
These are BER and CL that I bought cheaply a while ago, but now its not really available locally and I cannot ship it myself.


[17-Apr-22 04:40 PM] yang_mills#0000
I could fly there from Harmonia in 21h. How much time and fuel would a trip Harmonia -> Moria take?


[17-Apr-22 04:42 PM] namthorn#0000
Can use BLU to ballpark your flight times/cost


[17-Apr-22 04:47 PM] yang_mills#0000
What is BLU?


[17-Apr-22 04:47 PM] namthorn#0000
Blueprint command, can make ship blueprints and test fly them


[17-Apr-22 04:48 PM] namthorn#0000
If you just leave everything at the default on a new blueprint you get the starter ships


[17-Apr-22 04:48 PM] yang_mills#0000
Thanks


[17-Apr-22 04:52 PM] yang_mills#0000
Between 2 and 3 days depending on the fuel used.


[17-Apr-22 04:55 PM] yang_mills#0000
At max fuel consumption 2 days 4h.


[17-Apr-22 04:56 PM] yang_mills#0000
At min, 2 days 18h.


[17-Apr-22 04:57 PM] yang_mills#0000
I can do this flight, but perhaps someone else can do it sooner.


[17-Apr-22 05:00 PM] yang_mills#0000
By the way, there is cheap SCR sold on Moria, at 99 NCC/u. Does your shipment take all the cargo? If not, I could bring some SCR from Moria.


[17-Apr-22 05:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The most important shipment is 340t


[17-Apr-22 05:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
339.84 to be precise. I think its fine if you loaded 160t of SCR and left my CL for another time


[17-Apr-22 06:03 PM] yang_mills#0000
Let's do like that.

I wonder where I could find 50k PE.


[25-Apr-22 07:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Our CX has the best total supply, but a big chunk of it is at 6 AIC and 8 AIC, which is honestly bad for that quantity.

@allocater small shipment on ANT CX LM to hephaestus


[26-Apr-22 02:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
How much cargo space left (t/m^3) do you have left on Harmonia -> Deimos? And what's the price per 100t?


[26-Apr-22 05:40 AM] insensless72#0000
I will let you know once I load up my consumables, should be around 200t


[26-Apr-22 05:40 AM] insensless72#0000

Go ahead and post it, itll only be like 15mins before its back on planet


[05-May-22 03:01 PM] yang_mills#0000
I will pay for the extra fuel costs.


[05-May-22 03:01 PM] yang_mills#0000
How much SF did you burn to get to the orbit?


[05-May-22 03:02 PM] insensless72#0000
48 units


[05-May-22 03:02 PM] yang_mills#0000
times 2 for the return?


[05-May-22 03:03 PM] insensless72#0000
I would assume so, itll be 9mins before I can send it back. Were only talking like 800 AIC worth of fuel


[05-May-22 03:03 PM] insensless72#0000
Post it for 400 and itll be fine


[05-May-22 03:04 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok, so will include this cost in the ad.


[05-May-22 03:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
Let me know when you arrive on Harmonia. I will provision the other ad with 2 bta.


[05-May-22 03:08 PM] insensless72#0000
I misread, i thought it was 8mins, its actually 8 hrs .. lol


[05-May-22 03:10 PM] yang_mills#0000
Wow. Because you already got to the orbit?


[05-May-22 03:11 PM] insensless72#0000
I have no idea, it was in flight for like a min.. seems weird that it would take 8hrs to return but its no big deal


[05-May-22 03:13 PM] yang_mills#0000
If this delays you too much, we could just both extend our contracts.


[05-May-22 03:13 PM] insensless72#0000
it depends on the return. If it takes 8hrs to get back on planet ill just send it to Harmonia and we'll push the contracts


[05-May-22 03:14 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok, we can do that.


[05-May-22 03:15 PM] yang_mills#0000
Let me rather put the buy ad for 2 BTA on Harmonia, and delete yours. Because I have to provision this.


[05-May-22 05:18 PM] yang_mills#0000

I don't have the CIS to do this but I would like to point out that PG is quite a bit cheaper on the Benten CX compared to ANT


[02-Jun-22 03:12 PM] namthorn#0000
it's quite a bit cheaper in-house too.


[02-Jun-22 03:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
how much total supply in the “cheap” range?


[02-Jun-22 03:13 PM] namthorn#0000
is not what i would consider "cheap" PG, just cheap relative to other CXs

[02-Jun-22 03:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
those prices are just arbitrary


[02-Jun-22 03:15 PM] churavis#0000
I was under the impression the corp had a PG shortage


[02-Jun-22 03:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i would never pay above 25 per PG, way better to produce it for yourself at those rates unless your hands are really tied


[02-Jun-22 03:15 PM] namthorn#0000
we have production though. I've got 4.6k on the way to Nike, DLR has a ton of PG production on phobos, and Yang is setting up a PG base soon


[02-Jun-22 03:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The market is a bit of a shambles though, I do admit.


[02-Jun-22 03:18 PM] namthorn#0000
there's a general universe-wide shortage yea.


[02-Jun-22 03:18 PM] namthorn#0000
seems to be happening a lot for anything not T1


[02-Jun-22 03:18 PM] namthorn#0000
at least locally


[02-Jun-22 03:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sorry for my language earlier @churavis . PG is an ideal item to ship for a margin, the cargo footprint is so small, its very efficient


[02-Jun-22 03:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but these prices are so high as to be unstable*. I would worry about the integrity of that margin, and who would buy at the destination


[02-Jun-22 03:20 PM] namthorn#0000
yea if you were planning on an arbitrage trip it might be worth. But not for general use.


[02-Jun-22 03:20 PM] namthorn#0000
I think  a fair few would buy it though


[02-Jun-22 03:20 PM] namthorn#0000
PG-related goods are also soaring in price


[02-Jun-22 03:20 PM] namthorn#0000
LSE, PSL etc


[02-Jun-22 03:21 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, that's why I expect PG won't go down any time soon. Most that have it prefer to turn it into something more profitable


[02-Jun-22 03:21 PM] namthorn#0000
i guess some major suppliers either quit or started using all their own supply


[02-Jun-22 03:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
aluminum crunch makes it worse, since POL are heavy on lfabs


[02-Jun-22 03:24 PM] churavis#0000

[11-Jun-22 10:46 AM] churavis#0000
Uh-oh, I don't have enough FF, does anyone have some on Harmonia or that they can get there soon?


[11-Jun-22 10:50 AM] churavis#0000
Or maybe I can make a side trip to Deimos for the FF and MHL first


[11-Jun-22 10:51 AM] allocater#0000
I test if someone on LM has FF


[11-Jun-22 11:00 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have fuel on KI-446b, so even if you arrive completely empty, you will not be stranded


[11-Jun-22 11:01 AM] churavis#0000
Good to know but I don't eve have enough to make the slowest version of the trip one way atm


[11-Jun-22 11:16 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So the plan is we choose 1 of 2 options:

1. Bring COF/CAF to KI-446b
2. Bring NS + MHL to KI-446b


[11-Jun-22 11:17 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It does depend on @thummper , but if he misses the boat, i will choose option 2 since it is in my control and cheaper than buying COF/CAF on the market.


[11-Jun-22 11:18 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In this case, you load NS from my harmonia base, then go to deimos to load up my MHL, then you figure out the fuel situation and send off 🚀


[11-Jun-22 11:19 AM] allocater#0000
I can fuel it on deimos


[11-Jun-22 11:19 AM] churavis#0000
I know YJ14 stocks fuel on Deimos so the side trip there would likely fix the fuel situation


[11-Jun-22 11:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lol, I realize I am missing LBH on KI-446. These also need to be loaded on Deimos


[11-Jun-22 11:20 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
minimum of 2, preferably 4. I have 2 already out there, so 2 more would build it.


[11-Jun-22 11:21 AM] churavis#0000
Well, I think the decision is made then


[11-Jun-22 11:21 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
unless thumper is sitting on 100+ CAF


[11-Jun-22 11:21 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
makes it even easier in the short term


[11-Jun-22 11:21 AM] allocater#0000

[11-Jun-22 11:24 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I suppose the deimos thing introduces a delay


[11-Jun-22 11:25 AM] churavis#0000
I was going to wait for another 20 PWO to finish But I don't think it matters that much


[11-Jun-22 11:25 AM] churavis#0000
I'll still have 40 to sell


[11-Jun-22 11:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh well. There will be more MHL in deimos in the future. This idea to build an HYF out there does seem pretty future proof


[11-Jun-22 11:26 AM] churavis#0000
Isn't the MHL on Deimos?


[11-Jun-22 11:26 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes


[11-Jun-22 11:26 AM] churavis#0000
I'm going to go to Deimos first


[11-Jun-22 11:27 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes..


[11-Jun-22 11:29 AM] churavis#0000
Also, do you need EXO, PT or REP for the HYF? I have some on Harmonia


[11-Jun-22 11:29 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
posted two shipments on KI-446b with the 2 different pickup points


[11-Jun-22 11:30 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is a good point. I was prepared to run it with only pioneers and maybe some very unhappy settlers, but that would be super convenient


[11-Jun-22 11:31 AM] churavis#0000
I've got 110 EXO, 11 PT and 14 REP to spare


[11-Jun-22 11:33 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
2 REP will last about 50 days by my calculation, if you have only 20 settlers


[11-Jun-22 11:34 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so, 2 REP, 5 PT, 5 EXO would be the 50-day supply

I put up a shipping add to move some small items from Deimos->Harmonia if anyone happens to be flying that way before I do. I haven't a clue what fair shipping prices are, but the offer is 750 aic for 4.t/12.4m^3 in total


[14-Jun-22 11:51 PM] churavis#0000
Within corp, the general price is 10 per ton or per m^3, whichever is greater.


[14-Jun-22 11:52 PM] exeler#0000
Cool, so my price is more than fair 😄


[15-Jun-22 06:11 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Is that on the corp ships as well? I need to make sure I’m paying appropriately


[15-Jun-22 07:19 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I usually do this on the corp ships as well. I think officially the corp ship pilots have only asked for whatever we want to tip them, but I generally use this 10 AIC per ton/m3 as a good indicator for tip amount!

the important stuff got picked by rando and the SIO shipment had no priority


[16-Jun-22 05:58 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Sounds good. I do make a nearly empty run from Phobos to ANT most days, so I’ll start posting about that and happy to take SIO or whatever on those


[16-Jun-22 06:07 AM] namthorn#0000
what're you transporting on a daily basis with a near-empty ship? i hope it's full coming back at least 😄


[16-Jun-22 06:16 AM] allocater#0000
what are you flying TO phobos? if it's small you can put it on the STL express


[16-Jun-22 07:55 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Ore and minerals.  I don't do it every day, but early on I don't have a big buffer saved up, so it's nice to sell what I produce.  I make fuel, so it's not the worst expense


[16-Jun-22 08:50 AM] namthorn#0000
You're eating into your profits and therefore, your growth. every extra trip back and forth is ~150 SF, close to 2k gross in sales at CX rates, which is big early on if you're doing it regularly.


[16-Jun-22 08:51 AM] namthorn#0000
cadence on trips should be as slow as possible to keep your production lines going


[16-Jun-22 10:02 AM] domicius#0000
Yeah. Need to make sure holds are full.

If Manofthesea really buys me that ship, we’re gonna have another great corp ship


[19-Jun-22 12:48 PM] insensless72#0000
SEA said he'd buy you a ship??


[19-Jun-22 12:51 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Yep, from us for 4.7 million…


[19-Jun-22 12:56 PM] insensless72#0000
Wait am I missing something? he's paying us for a ship for you so we can have another corp ship?


[19-Jun-22 12:57 PM] insensless72#0000
Any strings?


[19-Jun-22 01:30 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Maybe he’s just goofing off or something will come up, but that’s what he seems to be offering. DLR posted a blueprint, SEA asked if anyone wanted it and I said yes


[19-Jun-22 01:31 PM] domicius#0000
Well, don't look a gift ship in the warp nacelles, I always say

Anyone need to move stuff from Harmonia->(somewhere I can buy bfab like nike/deimos) or from ANT -> Harmonia?

I've got a ship sitting idle on Harmonia that I was planning on sending somewhere to buy some more bfabs. 

Also got a ship that's going to bring back supplies from the CX -> Harmonia. I'm poor so it'll be mostly empty. Willing to add in a pit stop if needed since the supplies aren't super critical (yet)


[20-Jun-22 01:35 AM] allocater#0000
I could move crops to deimos

[20-Jun-22 09:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
Oops, I picked up allocater's shipping contracts this morning before I checked discord. but I can bring back bfabs from deimos if you want.

Sniped


[02-Jul-22 08:28 AM] churavis#0000
Sorry, should have raised the rating requirement. It was sniped by someone new who doesn't even have a base on Hephaestus and will probably spend way more on the detour than the payment he'll get

The options were Heph and Phobos but it looks like none of those buildings will match with the COGC

yes, PE is a real problem at the moment


[12-Aug-22 05:56 PM] churavis#0000
PE has been consistently high priced at the market lately as well


[12-Aug-22 05:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Loan Manta is out of control; I just can't imagine that strategy is going to make him all that much money


[12-Aug-22 05:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
at some point he's just sitting on a stock of hundreds of thousands of PE


[12-Aug-22 05:59 PM] churavis#0000
He probably bought a lot of it from other CX's


[12-Aug-22 06:08 PM] domicius#0000
I can make PE for youse on Phobos.


[12-Aug-22 06:11 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Loan Manta's stock has been growing over time


[12-Aug-22 06:11 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don't know why he'd ship it in and not sell it at 9/u


[12-Aug-22 06:11 PM] jackinabox86#0000
it's usually between 5-7


[12-Aug-22 06:12 PM] churavis#0000

FS can be anywhere as long as the products are delivered to heph (very heavy) or phobos (connectors are light)


[13-Aug-22 02:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, this guy always does. So a while ago, my liquidity has been used to buy a batch of pe. If he raises the price, I will make money with it. If the price falls, I will use it to produce BDE.


[13-Aug-22 02:21 AM] insensless72#0000
I would buy your PE regardless of price

We typically tip. There isn’t a standard amount yet, although the survey shows strong interest in that. I usually do 4/t


[13-Aug-22 09:06 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I usually tip 5/t or more if its a long trip. But most of my shipping contracts are just in the local Antares systems


[13-Aug-22 09:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have calculated before that 4/t is a reasonable price in AI area, and it is more suitable for cargo owners considering the avoidance of empty ships.

Because it can block out information that has nothing to do with you.

I don't have RATs and DW on Heph, but if you have extra, I'm happy to pay whatever for them if they get to Demeter.  Looks like that's all I need there

I just put up a ton of shipping ads from ANT -> Griffonstone. If anyone's flying that with empty space and want's a little extra $ for the flight check out the ANT LM. None of it is super critical, just bulk shipping inputs so I don't have to worry about them for a while.

Could someone please explain to a noob the etiquette of pricing shipping contracts? Is there a formula or a fixed rate that the corp uses depending on how much material needs to be moved and how far it needs to be moved by?


[26-Oct-22 12:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
5 per ton or m3, whichever is higher


[26-Oct-22 12:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
we make more money on the short trips than the long ones, but it generally evens out and is cheaper than the typical market price


[26-Oct-22 12:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
you're new, so if that's an issue for a bigger shipment, I doubt anyone will care


[26-Oct-22 12:58 PM] jackinabox86#0000
but I wouldn't expect corp shipping to take a ton of shipping off your back; it's sort of a nice bonus when it works out


[26-Oct-22 12:59 PM] optitronic#0000
OK that makes sense, thanks!


[26-Oct-22 12:59 PM] allocater#0000
new players are usually the ones with shipping capacity left, while old players are bottlenecked by it

Do we have a list of shipping routes people in the corporation are commonly using?


[03-Nov-22 01:04 PM] rune_242#0000
not a bad idea


[03-Nov-22 01:05 PM] rune_242#0000
maybe we should make another thread with the routes we use often.

I was planning on setting up a regular route between Harmonia and Norwick to move consumables, water, and ag products


[03-Nov-22 01:17 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Honestly, you all need to post more shipping ads for low priority at the c rating. When I send ships, I usually don’t have time to sit around waiting and don’t calculate all the space remaining before I land. More than happy to pick up cheap ads on the way out though.


[03-Nov-22 01:18 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Pressing things can get flagged, but if you just have a stack of C that can move anytime in a week, you could get lucky


[03-Nov-22 01:21 PM] allocater#0000
the ant<->deimos<->nike<->ant triangle has lots of ship and is almost always picked up at 10/u


[03-Nov-22 01:21 PM] churavis#0000
I feel like shopping routes might be better in a google worksheet than as a channel


[03-Nov-22 04:19 PM] exeler#0000
Building a site that allows us to enter goods and where we want them to go and visualizing that flow graph sounds like an interesting project.

Even just for individual planning of shipping routes and schedules it could be useful to see volumes and bottlenecks  easily at a glance. Combine that with an option for a corp wide view and things could get interesting.


[03-Nov-22 04:31 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I would enjoy seeing that.  I have a number of optimizations that I'd like to figure out, but I never have time


[03-Nov-22 05:05 PM] dehzhas#0000
I am to the point where I need something like this. I have consumables cross-crossing the Ant space like a spider web. My long term goal has been to build a shipping service. You need lots of capital and logistics capability. The ROI for a ship doing nothing but ads is forever long, so you pretty much need to be able to pay cash


[03-Nov-22 05:05 PM] dehzhas#0000
Why do I want to build a shipping service? Just because 🙂

[03-Nov-22 11:07 PM] seraphx2#0000
I've actually been thinking about this. make a web app. load up your bases from FIO and you can specify exports between planets so you don't have to remember them all. it would all be client side in the browser. (one of those "don't delete your local cache type websites" so as to speed up development)

haven't quite gotten around to starting it but maybe I should start putting a priority on it :think:


[03-Nov-22 11:44 PM] exeler#0000
I was planning on making something with a proper backend. At least if there's some data that needs to be tracked that FIO doesn't have already. I do a lot of backend stuff (lots of REST api and database nonsense) for work so that's actually pretty easy for me to manage. I'm not as adept at apps that store everything client side as my typical client is `curl` not a smart browser. 

Also figuring out what gets exported to where should be an interesting little programming exercise. If every base is a node on a graph, it's basically just a problem of following sources of goods to their sinks. I think it's probably safe to assume the CX is the sink for all excess goods, with an option to say "actually I ship it to this LM". 

The interesting problem is taking that graph and calculating an optimal shipping route based on different criteria. Do we want the most fuel efficient route? The fastest route? The route that maximizes the volume/weight used by the ship? Are those answers all the same, or is it different based on what you care about more?

@gladeowl  I'm not sure if this will work like I'm imagining it but I was thinking of sending you this contract, the idea being that you can just pick it piece by piece as you go back and forth?

Nascent is basically on the way back from Demeter so you'd pass by it either way although Norwick is closer

I threw up a rush order on the ANT LM to go to Hephaestus. This dum dum forgot to put an important input on a ship that's already going that way. 

2500 AIC for a fraction of a boat load. 

1 week of mobile only sans fio is gonna be the death of me 🤣


[25-Dec-22 11:57 PM] churavis#0000
My puddle jumper arrives on ANT in 8h and then goes to Heph, I'll pick it up if no one else does by then


[26-Dec-22 09:00 AM] churavis#0000
I deliberately didn't pick it up in case someone else could get it there sooner


[26-Dec-22 12:43 PM] exeler#0000
The dum dum was me. I was referring to myself.

If it's urgent then you should give it a 1 day timeline, otherwise some noob is going to accept it, take 3 days to pick it up and then 3 days to deliver it

Nike->Griff 194t/81m3 (807 MCG)

 How much should I set it for? (My first time making a shipping ad)


[10-Jan-23 04:38 PM] dehzhas#0000
Usually 10 per max of t or m3 is a good start


[10-Jan-23 04:38 PM] dehzhas#0000
15 is a good price for the shipper, will generally be picked up first


[10-Jan-23 04:39 PM] dehzhas#0000
Add 3-8/u for things out of the immediate CX range (e.g. Griff)


[10-Jan-23 04:39 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Good to know! Figured there was some sort of 'rules' to shipping pricing but couldn't figure it out at a glance.


[10-Jan-23 04:39 PM] dehzhas#0000
It's all highly variable and subjective, but those are my general rules of thumb


[10-Jan-23 04:40 PM] dehzhas#0000
Only hard and fast rule of shipping is don't ship something via someone else that you can't lose...


[10-Jan-23 04:40 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
How so?


[10-Jan-23 04:41 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is it buggy or something?


[10-Jan-23 04:43 PM] dehzhas#0000
Players are people and are sometimes slow, piracy is a thing too, also people quit the game sometimes with shipments in their inventory ... or don't delivery in a timely fashion


[10-Jan-23 04:43 PM] dehzhas#0000
No bugs, just some risk in using LM shipping ads.


[10-Jan-23 04:43 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
True... Shit I hadn't even thought of that.


[10-Jan-23 04:44 PM] dehzhas#0000
So, don't ship your FTL engine via LM ad... if you ship DW via LM ad and it gets delayed or pirated, no big deal, just buy more.


[10-Jan-23 04:44 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Right, makes sense.

I don't get my 2k/2k to Harmonica nearly enough. 

I'm usually flying to Nascent, not back to ANT though.

If anyone wants to do some shipping from Harmonia to Norwick and Nascent, I have a backlog to clear


[30-Aug-23 01:30 PM] higgsy#0000
I'll also post ads I need shipped from Harmonia to Norwick and Nascent


[30-Aug-23 11:22 PM] tuffyless#0000
I wanna make a boat that floats between Harmonia & Norwick.  
It would constantly move Agri from Harm and Foody's from Norwick.  Both PLI's are currently 1k area.
A 2nd boat will move the inputs from Deimos to Harm, such as Chem's & Fuels and move the Foody's from Harm to Deimos.  
Question - what kinda boat would be suggested between a constant Harm & Nor back-n-forth?  
A slow moving FTL Glass LCB?


[30-Aug-23 11:30 PM] churavis#0000
Just make it a stock carrier so you can use it for other stuff too. a glass engine isn't much good above 500t/v. I did the math once and it takes twice as long for 1000t as for 500t.

looking to deconstruct my bases out there. wondering if you can and would be willing to pick up materials from IY206c, IY-206d, and electronica as you can hold. there is no infrastructure on either of the IY-206 bases so not sure if you can help me there?


[04-Sep-23 04:00 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I don't have enough fuel for that. Sorry. I can take whatever you have on Electronica back to ANT.

Adding a set of shipping commands to the bot was another item already on my to-do list. 

Now that someone else has mentioned it, I might carve out some time to implement it.

Anyone know off hand if the fio API provides data about the materials and their weights and volumes? I don't really want to spend more time on data entry than writing code 😅

Hey all. Just to tell that i do transport 2000/2000, 3000/1000 and 1000/3000 from any CX to any CX for 30k (or more if too urgent) or 50/60 Ant-Mor as double time needed. I read all CX LM boards for shipping ads.  I always  have some ships available 🙂 . You can contr me directly too as most people do.  I am quiet busy with tons of contracts but corp ones will be priority if any 🙂

What are you doing all the way out on XH-083?


[14-Jan-24 09:36 AM] donmega1983#0000
You can produce water very well there. I save the space on other planets. Now I have the disadvantage that I need a lot of transport capacity.


[14-Jan-24 09:36 AM] churavis#0000
That's so far away from ANT though, what region are you based out of?


[14-Jan-24 09:38 AM] donmega1983#0000
Gibson 🙂 and Giedi Prime


[14-Jan-24 09:40 AM] donmega1983#0000
Do you know where I can get a big ship?


[14-Jan-24 09:40 AM] churavis#0000
We make ships but this is primarily an Antares region corp, you're going to have a hard time interacting with everyone in a different region


[14-Jan-24 09:41 AM] donmega1983#0000
and producing it yourself is very time-consuming.

no worries, it wasn't too far gone so i'll circle back around after this flight stage to pick them up, shouldn't be too long


[07-Feb-24 09:17 PM] churavis#0000
It's not urgent, I'm sure someone else would pick them up. I didn't realize you already left

You only posted 15 minutes before you left?

iirc it was either 35/45 minutes before i left


[07-Feb-24 09:18 PM] Deleted User#0000

there to be a convenience for whoever needed it, not money, so unless you need them urgently ill pick them up for you, no issue there

It's not urgent but I'm sure you'd be faster than anyone else

[12-Jun-24 10:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I’ll be making trips to Halcyon fairly regularly as I empty out and rebuild the base for C, so I’ll ping you whenever I have capacity 🙂

I can sell you a lot of HCP on SE-110d if that's helpful. Up to 2000@150/u

[02-Jul-24 04:11 PM] exeler#0000
It's not critical, and it is a lot of GRN. I'll be sending the 2k/2k out there anyways since I've got enough to fill it ready to go.

the NS isn't critical, but the water is.  water for the input, not DW

Send me a contract for however much you need until you can get a ship from ANT


[05-Jul-24 11:57 AM] katinga#0000
how much can you spare?


[05-Jul-24 11:58 AM] churavis#0000
Enough to get you to your next shipment


[05-Jul-24 11:58 AM] katinga#0000

Right, so calculate the bare minimum you need to get them online until your next ship from ANT comes


[05-Jul-24 12:05 PM] katinga#0000
can you spare 880?

Does anyone run ships with spare mass capacity back from Hyalos?  I have a huge amount of TAI to ship to ANT


[04-Nov-24 06:29 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I do.  I use Hyalos as a glass factory so my products are pretty light.  I usually only send 500/500 ships there, but they always leave with spare capacity


[04-Nov-24 06:31 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I can send a 2k/2k out there on my next run if you need extra shipping back


[07-Nov-24 04:54 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Still looking for shipping from Hyalos?  Going to send my next run out there soon.

[07-Dec-24 02:55 PM] bookliko#0000
Does anyone do regular (daily?) Harmonia <-> ANT and/or ANT <-> Ice station runs?
After weeks of renting a 500/500 ship the ship owner disappeared and am now relying on LM adds. 
I am working on freeing up my own ship in a week or so, but would be nice to have predictable shipping until I sort things out 🙂


[08-Dec-24 02:32 PM] roche3950#0000
have some capacity for ANT -> Harmonia if you need anything at the moment at least


[08-Dec-24 03:22 PM] bookliko#0000
See, my need is primarily in having a regular shipping service. If you have reliable daily rhythm, we can do business. If its irregular, I'll rather put it on LM, but feel free to snatch them. 
I usually post on LM around 7 and 21 CET


[21-Dec-24 11:13 AM] roche3950#0000

How much needs moved? I could bring my HCB over

All of it but I’ve got a LCB coming to take about 1000 of it

Cool - put together a shopping contract for however much will fit in a 5k/5k and I’ll pick it up! It might take about a day to get there though
