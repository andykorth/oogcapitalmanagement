Yep, 1500 FF and 6000 SF available so I should have your needs covered

Oops, wrong convo. But there's the current Nike reserves if anyone is interested! Lol


[11-Aug-22 10:04 AM] domicius#0000
@Nike anyone have a pile of LST? A few ship loads?


[11-Aug-22 10:34 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Lol you posted this in fuel ops but I posted for you in the other Nike channel 😅


[11-Aug-22 11:13 AM] yang_mills#0000

YJ is probably gone.  I can cover your SF on Phobos, Deimos, or ANT


[29-Sep-22 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah that's right. I'll see if my ships make it to ANT or not 😄


[29-Sep-22 12:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
If I still had a ship at Deimos, I'd send it to Nike with SF, but I already took off this morning


[29-Sep-22 12:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
It looks like I'll make it to ANT with 0 FF 😁


[29-Sep-22 12:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
The Nike -> ANT journey is easy


[29-Sep-22 12:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
No landing required on ANT, so it's almost a free stop


[29-Sep-22 01:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have a feeling that the price of fuel is going to go up at the market


[29-Sep-22 01:07 PM] jackinabox86#0000
FF maybe, but the SF market has been swamped for a while.  Going to take some time for the excess to get bought out


[29-Sep-22 01:08 PM] jackinabox86#0000
a lot of people expanded on to GAL planets, etc., so it's not like they can just swap out a recipe at their BMP; there is a lot of committed infrastructure that is essentially useful only for fuel production


[29-Sep-22 03:39 PM] exeler#0000
You should buy a bunch of it on the CX and see if you can sell it higher later.


[29-Sep-22 07:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
I started hoarding FF at HRT.


[30-Sep-22 09:01 AM] Deleted User#0000

I really need to fund a warehouse upgrade on Nike so I can get more room... Nike is full of heavy things and I don't want to waste space on an STO


[15-Nov-22 11:22 AM] yjhasaday#0000
lol you definitely need STO's on Nike, I have 3. I know others do too because I asked around here back when I had one or two and didn't think more were justified. The three I built have been worth every bit of space they require!

Whats the going rate for fuel? Want to throw up a fuel add just dont want to put the wrong price. Is it still 8 or more now?


[18-Nov-22 11:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
8/u for both SF and FF


[18-Nov-22 12:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
That’s for the CX. Here in corp YJ and I just produce at 8


[19-Nov-22 11:50 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, its one of the many reasons to be in a corp over flying solo in this game! The CX price doesn't matter, we sell to OOG members at a flat rate 🙂 I filled a couple fuel ads on Nike today but I don't remember seeing your company name - did you get the fuel you needed?

Posting here isn't 100% necessary, but it guarantees I'll see it next time I log in - and it allows me to follow up if its not on LM for whatever reason. I encourage posting here but there's usually a pretty good chance I'll catch it on the LM. Also some people just send me a contract directly

@yuen8241 and @rune_242 we had a HE3 shortage recently and I don't currently have enough FF to fill both your 3K orders. Do one of you have less urgency? Or can you both knock your orders down to half?


[19-Jan-23 11:37 AM] gladeowl#0000
Is this a temporary shortage or do we need to plan a new base or expansion?


[19-Jan-23 12:18 PM] rune_242#0000
I think the best is we both knock it down to half


[19-Jan-23 06:14 PM] yuen8241#0000
It doesn't matter. I can buy it in CX. I can buy it from the cheapest place in the four CX.
