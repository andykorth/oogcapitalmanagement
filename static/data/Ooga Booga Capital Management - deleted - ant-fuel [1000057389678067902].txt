One downside to ANT as a fuel trade is I can't post a general buy Ad on ANT

why not? if you actually get the fuel at corp prices, whats the problem?

How is the re-supply lining up with the demand? I have another load on its way but its mostly SF (10k SF, but only 2k FF this time). I was out of HE3 for a while, I fear we may be undersupplied for both of us to produce FF around the clock üò¶ maybe I'll fly some more b and l fabs out the next time I head to my HE3 base, see if I can increase its output.

Am I right to assume we're oversupplying SF for you but undersupplying FF?

current stock is 10k FF, 30k SF

Why don't you consider collecting HE3 directly from a planet? It's not cost-effective to produce He3 with TS.

At the time of creating the base I found the efficiency is similar to IY-206i because of IY's low concentration. And Avalon offers easy access to consumables (its an FP planet) and other natural resources - I've had a monopoly on the sulfur market in Antares ever since I found the base lol

[27-Apr-23 12:29 PM] neth_havoc#0000
AMM and H from QJ-382g, HE3 from Hernanduer (ANT, I guess).


[27-Apr-23 12:30 PM] neth_havoc#0000
GAL is the only problem for now.
