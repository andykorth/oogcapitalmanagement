I will be temporarily taking the google sheet offline as it pends a rework.


[20-Apr-24 04:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
We'll clear up this channel after it is done to return AGP to normal standard.

Lets rob the banks. 😛


[20-Apr-24 05:25 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Just not our banks. We can start with Promitors.


[20-Apr-24 06:25 PM] talryk#0000
I don’t think robbing a pile of dirt would be particularly difficult, nor worth bragging about. :hehehe:


[20-Apr-24 06:28 PM] tanda#0000
hey, that's what we call ALO extraction, not robbing banks

As a heads up I'm going to be liquidating as much of my 100m AIC worth as possible within the coming hours as I'll be quitting the game shortly.

[11-May-24 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Said 100m will be used exclusively for grants, and I may consider opening up another round for everyone interested if we don't get enough new people.


[11-May-24 12:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
If there are any projects or things you are interested in getting funding for, now is the time to give me a shout. @AGP @Project Member


[11-May-24 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh no, leaving??? 😭  We will miss you australis!


[11-May-24 12:26 PM] kaosaur#0000
Agreed


[11-May-24 12:26 PM] kaosaur#0000
But understandable

[11-May-24 12:28 PM] seacilia#0000
Oh no! Sad to see you go.


[11-May-24 12:41 PM] havanista#0000
oh well, so have a nice retreat...


[11-May-24 12:41 PM] havanista#0000
allways ok for another grant, anyway


[11-May-24 12:46 PM] m3tzg3r#0000
@Deleted User why are you quitting the game? if you can i'd be happy with 850k - 1m to complete the PG base


[11-May-24 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
General thing is I don't find it fun anymore, I don't really get anything out of it and I just have no willpower to do even the most basic of things in the game anymore so I'm calling it quits.


[11-May-24 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Essentially really bad burn out.


[11-May-24 12:48 PM] m3tzg3r#0000
i understand


[11-May-24 12:48 PM] seacilia#0000
Understandable, I foresee that potentially happening at the endgame for me as well.


[11-May-24 12:49 PM] m3tzg3r#0000
i guess there is not much to do in the endgame but repetetive clicking


[11-May-24 12:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
The journey to making money was more interesting than having money.


[11-May-24 12:49 PM] seacilia#0000
Isn't it always

I will return when the flag of Antares waves over Hortus.

Indeed, I have appreciated all the help you've given through the ADI project!


[11-May-24 04:56 PM] blatt.laus#0000
sounds like a good decision when you already have a burnout! I have plans for a EPO or EDC base and I would be happy for a funding in the range of 1-9m


[14-May-24 06:26 AM] antisyntax#0000
if you still have some left in the bank, i'd be happy to take some off your hands 😛
