I think we need a new channel for discussing in-corp gateway coordination!

Also, a pretty good chunk of the ADI gateway coop, by percentage of shares is OOG members


[21-Dec-24 12:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
about 2/3rds


[21-Dec-24 12:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
## Ledger Update

I have updated the ledger with the 3rd gateway, from Hekaton -> BEN. The ledger now shows progress towards each individual gateway, with pledged allocated from the first gateway to the last gateway.

Our current pledged resources account for the following:

* 97.8%    Heph -> Hekaton
* 80.0%    Hekaton -> Heph
* 9.9%    Hekaton -> BEN

With the addition of the third gateway, more room for pledges has opened up!

## Cash Contributions:

With 130m donated, I have begun spending the cash contributions to fill out materials. Only 15.6m has been spent so far, because I've been aggressively responsible with contributed cash. My fiduciary duty means I must buy at good prices to ensure donators get a good quantity of shares for their donations.  I do have open buy orders pending on various CXes.

Pinned a message.


[21-Dec-24 12:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
So there's a little of everything left on the ledger again!


[24-Dec-24 08:29 AM] katinga#0000
Any materials you need, let me know.  I have a couple of permits I'm not using


[24-Dec-24 01:40 PM] exeler#0000
I haven't build a new base in ages, so I have a couple permits to spare. My HQ also isn't needing afabs yet, and I'm sitting on 30m cash plus who knows how much stashed in giant CX buy orders. 

Anything interesting I could build to help move gateways along? I have tons and tons of C to spare since I produce 10x what I currently need.

I also have a ton of ships to haul heavy stuff around already so logistics isn't a bottleneck currently for me.


[24-Dec-24 02:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
So after launch we will need a few extraction bases for the new metal. Then process it in SMEs and ASMs as quickly as possible.


[24-Dec-24 02:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Prior to launch SP and LIT are interesting items that are still kind of short. So that might be CUO or NE on the extraction side.


[24-Dec-24 02:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also I don’t know anyone in ANT making vortex fuel yet.


[24-Dec-24 02:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
The vortex fuel recipe is here. https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/posts/what-we-know-about-gateways/ about halfway down

[28-Dec-24 12:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay anyone who wants to help out, SP is in the shortest supply. I got some more cash donations- so if you want cash instead of shares, I have SP orders up at 3100/u


[28-Dec-24 12:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have an obligation to spend the delivered cash!


[28-Dec-24 03:36 AM] evov#0000
How many do you need? I kind of want to build up a stockpile up to my goal amount before I start unloading too much of it. After that I''m happy to sell into whatever's needed really.


[28-Dec-24 08:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
About another 10k total, but I expect others to continue to contribute.


[28-Dec-24 08:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
This chart fills the leftmost gateway first, and shows progress of each material for each planned gateway:

[28-Dec-24 08:37 AM] archielvahr#0000
So first gateway is totally done, second gateway has 66.63% of the SP (and is close to having everything else pledged), etc


[05-Jan-25 02:04 AM] allocater#0000
I am still working on my pledged SP 😄


[05-Jan-25 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah SP will be one of the tough ones. I have been buying some on the CX also. But once we have a bit more SP the first two gates will be fully pledged


[05-Jan-25 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
I got another 50m of cash from @neth_havoc  (thanks!) So any of our new folks who want to contribute, happy to send you cash!


[05-Jan-25 10:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
The SP rate is a little on the low side compared to the current CX prices. But I have bids up at 3100 for SP


[05-Jan-25 10:30 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I am now making SP full time on my only ECA

I am making TSH in 2 PP4 non-stop. I have 200 already


[06-Jan-25 12:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'll increase my TSH to 900, I'm at almost 500 stock


[06-Jan-25 12:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
I just got like 1800 more SP yesterday!


[06-Jan-25 03:14 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Are you buying ABH at 50k/u?


[06-Jan-25 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
ABH is at $42,295  right now.


[06-Jan-25 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
If we run way short (which I don't really expect), then I can bump that up


[12-Feb-25 01:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
First round of gateway pledge reminders has gone out


[13-Feb-25 05:58 AM] evov#0000
For most of the parts, I've completed all I need for 1 full gate so I've shut down the production of those parts.

If anyone wants to buy any, I can sell them now and just start producing again as needed. Shout out if there's any parts in particular people might want to buy.

 Some of the parts I've got stored up that are maybe less available in bulk from the CX ->  (Stock values as at last week)

[21-Feb-25 12:01 PM] martin1194#0000
When need it


[21-Feb-25 12:02 PM] martin1194#0000
Is that game dev still haven't gateway up?


[21-Feb-25 12:02 PM] martin1194#0000
my TRU is waiting at ANT. : D


[21-Feb-25 12:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Is that why Archiel had a large buy order going on at Ant?


[21-Feb-25 01:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Probably!


[21-Feb-25 01:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have been collecting pledges, we had a few people who pledged that quit, so when I do the next monthly update I will try to get new pledges to replace them


[21-Feb-25 01:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
still no idea when gateways will come out 🤷‍♂️


[21-Feb-25 01:31 PM] bookliko#0000
Say a contributor quits after transferring the materials or funds. Will those shares be divided by the remaining contributors?


[21-Feb-25 01:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
There is a survivorship rule in place:


[21-Feb-25 01:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
If a co-op shareholder leaves the game, their shares will move to their designated survivor. If they have not mentioned one, or their choice is not available, it will move to their corp. If no corp representative is available, the shares are eliminated and everyone’s shares are recalculated without the eliminated shares included.


[21-Feb-25 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
So yeah, essentially divided out if we can't reattribute it to someone else


[21-Feb-25 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
But so far everyone who has ditched has left before contributing 😆


[02-Mar-25 12:27 PM] emperyan11#0000
You still taking donations for the gateways?


[02-Mar-25 04:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, I am!


[02-Mar-25 04:16 PM] emperyan11#0000
Just like a 1 H2O contract?


[02-Mar-25 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, and I will log it on the sheet


[02-Mar-25 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think I am a bit behind on spending, so I can probably get the contribution spent pretty quickly


[03-Mar-25 09:40 AM] emperyan11#0000
Contract sent!


[04-Mar-25 03:28 PM] emperyan11#0000
So, what else can I get up to to help out? We still need a Vortex Fuel provider?


[04-Mar-25 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am not aware of anyone making vortex fuel


[04-Mar-25 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that might be great. Cause my personal plan was to ignore it. 😆


[04-Mar-25 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
We have no idea how much fuel it will use.


[04-Mar-25 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000

[04-Mar-25 04:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
It takes KR, which isn't released yet. But we know it's gonna take a ton of EEP time. almost more EEP time than REF time.


[04-Mar-25 04:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
But.. is it too early to make a lot of EEPs? Probably. You can start early and make a ton of EES for other stuff. But the ES itself will go really fast


[04-Mar-25 04:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Other than that.. we are pretty low on RBH and RSE. some of those people dropped out


[04-Mar-25 09:20 PM] emperyan11#0000
Good advice thanks! Yeah, I could use some RFabs mesself


[04-Mar-25 09:21 PM] emperyan11#0000
I'll probably try to make the VF when the time comes though 🙂

Got an update posted! Will share it publically tomorrow


[26-Apr-25 04:58 PM] swatacular#0000
Hi Gateway people, Id like to get involved.. I have a decent amount of Afabs that may be helpful. do we have any sort of expectation on what the fees would amount to? or is it a total guess?


[26-Apr-25 04:59 PM] swatacular#0000
also, considering the new fuel needs does anyone have a project planned to make said fuel?


[26-Apr-25 05:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah we still don't have info on the fuel and transit fees- we aren't sure how fast the gateways will be or how much fuel gets used per jumps


[26-Apr-25 05:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
We don't know the rarity of the new metals or the Krypton uet for the fuel, since it isn't in game yet


[26-Apr-25 05:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think anyone in corp has plans to make fuel


[26-Apr-25 05:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Mostly that would be somewhere with a ton of EEP buildings, since they are really small and really large buildings


[26-Apr-25 05:04 PM] swatacular#0000
hmmmmm 🧐

[26-Apr-25 05:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lots of stuff is pledged and I need to sort through some of those pledges to make sure they are still happening


[26-Apr-25 05:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
The shortages in rfabs in particular.....


[26-Apr-25 05:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I wonder if the rfabs market will decrease without IDC.. good question for @allocater . Maybe everyone will just want afabs instead for HQs instead of rfabs for SLs


[27-Apr-25 12:42 AM] allocater#0000
I have seen some downward pressure, but so far it's relatively stable


[28-Apr-25 08:40 AM] weltkriegdrei#0000
I don't make much LDE but I'd say I could pledge 20 if you take small amounts.


[28-Apr-25 09:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, definitely. I can pay for that too (out of the cash contributions), since you probably need cash more than you need project shares

{Reactions}
👍 

[28-Apr-25 10:01 AM] weltkriegdrei#0000
Absolutely


[28-Apr-25 03:01 PM] melon164#0000
Screenshot in the devlog suggests gateways will eat SPT as upkeep consumables 🤔


[28-Apr-25 03:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think it's been SPT for a while, though they reduced the amount of SP and POW a while ago


[28-Apr-25 03:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
plus 1 KV -> 100 SPT so I think that'll be okay


[28-Apr-25 04:57 PM] melon164#0000
Yeah, I changed the scream emoji when I realised the output multiplier


[28-Apr-25 04:57 PM] melon164#0000
10 KV a week would be no joke


[29-Apr-25 09:51 AM] allocater#0000
SP upkeep or SP construction costs?


[29-Apr-25 09:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
For the upkeep
