Use the /order or /project command to order your ship parts - this way it won't get lost in the busier #orders  or #ship-building channels.

[25-Aug-24 01:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
How to allow dms from the bot?


[25-Aug-24 02:09 AM] exeler#0000
I think it's on by default. At least, I didn't have to enable anything for it. I wonder if there's some kind of setting for only allowing DMs from specific people that might be excluding the bot?

Looks like this is a common issue with bots that rely on DMs breaking when people use the non-default privacy settings for DMs. Wild that discord doesn't have a simple way to allow DMs from a specific bot, or at least a quick google didn't turn up any simple ways to do it.


[25-Aug-24 02:32 AM] mrsmith33#0000

Good to know, that makes sense. Online it looks like others have hit this same issue and were complaining discord didn't have a way to do something like specifically allow a bot to send DMs for cases like this. 

DMs from people in this server seems pretty safe, but if this were a bot you wanted to use in a larger public server, that might not be a setting you'd want to switch back on if you've already turned it off for some reason.

I did 600k for the RDL. I don't have any STS and not sure if anyone is making them in corp. I can't really fit an AAF in on Heph.. I might need a major manufacturing rework to add them.

Yeah exactly lol, I don't even know what I'm clickin on anymore


[14-Dec-24 11:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay I still am looking for MFLs. I guess that means I'm _really_ just looking for ZR cause there seems to be plenty of SKF availability. But if anyone can knock out like 8 of them or has 80+ ZR, let me know


[14-Dec-24 11:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Heph is fillin' up so I gotta complete some ships, heh

The external sale price is 120k, but if that's too low these days I could adjust it

Not a lot of ZR moving on the market but at market rate it's 140k of ZR ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Not right now. Sold about 8 or 9 in the previous week and a bit. And have someone waiting on 4 now. So might be a few more days before I've plugged the gaps on the pieces I'm short on. If people get desperate I can just buy more of the limiting items off the CX... but I'm hopeful I can solve it with production.


[05-Jan-25 10:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Fortunately you can pull them out if you need to


[04-Mar-25 11:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Looks pretty sweet to me. Make sure to throw in an SST.. cause I have a ton of them


[04-Mar-25 11:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
honestly I might have to start giving them out for free


[04-Mar-25 11:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Oh yeah STS. I'll send you some!


[04-Mar-25 11:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I made an AAF to make gateway stuff, right? And... the only thing it can really make now are NV2s and STS


[04-Mar-25 11:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh


[04-Mar-25 11:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000

No problem. It's going to take more than a few days at least for me to get the shields together after filling orders for other folks even if the entire project is filled.
