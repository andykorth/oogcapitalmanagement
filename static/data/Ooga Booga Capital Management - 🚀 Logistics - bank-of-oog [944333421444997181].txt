any good ideas how to invest it?


[12-Mar-22 04:36 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think best investment is to find MM product on CX, and create chain for it


[12-Mar-22 04:36 AM] dasefx1#0000
I reduce activity all time, so I am not intrested 🙂


[12-Mar-22 04:38 AM] allocater#0000
maybe building up SAR production can keep the ADR profits even with the coming nerf 🤔


[12-Mar-22 04:40 AM] dasefx1#0000
for sure, my SAR production cost is 9k , so for sure it can increase profits


[12-Mar-22 04:41 AM] allocater#0000
yeah I have to pay 18-20k atm for it


[12-Mar-22 04:42 AM] dasefx1#0000
so it should be good investment 🙂


[13-Mar-22 09:10 AM] allocater#0000
2 ELP + 2 SCA cost 1mil in R-fabs and then I have to import 7 different goods 🤔


[13-Mar-22 10:35 AM] insensless72#0000
@dasefx1 Do you still have TRU?


[13-Mar-22 10:50 AM] dasefx1#0000
@insensless72 yes 70 on phobosor 270 on CX


[13-Mar-22 10:50 AM] insensless72#0000
Ill take the 70 you have on Phobos


[13-Mar-22 10:52 AM] dasefx1#0000
sure


[13-Mar-22 10:53 AM] dasefx1#0000
@allocater I will tell you that SAR production is not easy 🙂 I think build chain from basic , as it will be hard to keep it fully operating if you start from the end


[13-Mar-22 10:57 AM] allocater#0000
yes, I think I would need 2 bases, manufacturing and electronics, both in ANT so STL ship would also be good


[13-Mar-22 10:57 AM] dasefx1#0000
antares 1 c is best for manufacturing 😄

@deleted-role Can we set up a payment for some players who are doing smelting work for the ships?


[31-Mar-22 09:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
For example, Artokun has produced 200 TI, and is about to start on 50 CF which is needed to produce more ships.


[31-Mar-22 09:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if so, please transfer me around 500k so I can start paying them out for the work at fair prices

@dasefx1 the auction has concluded, and the ship is mainly in your inventory


[08-Apr-22 07:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also I presume @spatial_piano has the engines on Antares 1 C


[08-Apr-22 07:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We need to organize the transfer of these materials to the auction winner, who I am in the process of vetting. First I will make them provide a screenshot of their 4 million+ credits


[09-Apr-22 04:10 AM] dasefx1#0000
when he pay you, let him list all on ant c LM, and pm me. Also if he will have only warehouse it is not enough space and I will need fullfill few times so let him know it

I would like to start a b-fab fund to finance INC SME (deimos) + PP2 (nike). ROI is like 1 week even if buying bfabs from MM. We should quickly fill all deimos and nike bases to max for all members. I am thinking 2m fund. Ad is up on phobos @dasefx1 what do you think?

I have a price quote request from a very wealthy player, 400+ days account. He wants the exact same ship as spice that we sell for 4m NCC, with QCR, FSE, LHP and 2000/2000 cargo.

{Reactions}
🥳 (2) 

[26-Apr-22 04:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am thinking 5m


[26-Apr-22 04:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
or 4.5m at least. Also, it seems like these FSEs are a standard request for the big ships.


[26-Apr-22 04:10 PM] spatial_piano#0000
FSE fuel efficiency is excelllent, and the speed difference is actually pretty small since you need the High G seats to take advantage of the extra thrust on ENG.


[26-Apr-22 04:12 PM] spatial_piano#0000
With larger ships ENG might have a more significant speed advantage, but I'm not sure if the ship mass is properly taken into account by the game at this point.


[26-Apr-22 04:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the differences become noticeable with RHP or better plates, and basic high g seats.


[26-Apr-22 04:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
seems most people prefer to go LHP for a bit more acceleration, and deal with repair fees later


[26-Apr-22 04:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this should be in ship building 🤣


[26-Apr-22 04:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
what do we think? 4.5 mil for the same ship?


[26-Apr-22 04:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thats a 12.5% raise, seems nice to me


[26-Apr-22 07:53 PM] insensless72#0000
Lets go for it, why not?


[26-Apr-22 07:53 PM] insensless72#0000
4.5 sounds good to me

@allocater @dasefx1 I was told to inquire here on details for a development loan for AL infrastructure. I've already got 2 EXT, 2 SME and 2 PP2. Looking to add smelters as I'm stockpiling ALO right now

[30-Apr-22 07:04 AM] insensless72#0000
It usually comes in the form of cash. Its best to have an idea mapped out in terms of the mats you will need and the cost to make it happen. Loans can also incorporate mats if you know what you need, theyre just in short supply at the moment


[04-May-22 04:53 AM] dasefx1#0000
I will quit tomorrow, so you need to choose who will do software 🙂 @bitcoin_ape I will send you list with all items, after I move all from ant c tomorrow morning.  You cantake all and allocate to others, or choose max 2 players to take all and share. On the end I will give all cash

[07-May-22 07:59 AM] insensless72#0000
Yes and no. The plan is to set up multiple funds. We have the OOG Metal Trust which is purchasing the metal required for ships. There will be OOG Investments which will fund new players or players who are interested in expansion, and most likely a governor fund to help pay to upkeep and programs

@everyone as insensless said, the metal trust will continue to build ships.

New members are welcome and encouraged to borrow interest free and on unlimited terms from this channel.

I have already approached many of you in DMs offering corporate money and investment for various projects. These offers are the same terms, and still stand.

Howdy bank people
Is there any chance I could get a 320k loan? 
This would finance doubling my C output from 20 -> 41 units / day 
and additionally expanding into CAF / COF production to generate 55 COF / day 

This would also increase my cash generation from 3K -> 14K per day

Hi bank of OOG, I've got my plan now in place to start a H/AMM base on QJ-382g! I would like to request a loan of 150K AIC to help with starting this base. However @bitcoin_ape or @allocater  mentioned that INS could be provided? In which case the loan would only need to be 100K AIC.

Here's what I still need to purchase:
6 x BBH
2 x LSE
12 x PSL
40 x AEF
1000 x INS
200 x RAT
200 x DW


[29-May-22 10:41 AM] insensless72#0000
I have your INS in my inv on Nike


[29-May-22 10:41 AM] insensless72#0000
Is 1000 all youll need or just to set up your base?


[29-May-22 10:46 AM] yjhasaday#0000
1000 covers 2 x HB1 and 2 x COL/EXT (not sure which I need yet, I thought H and AMM are both gas so a COL would extract both but I see Mark has more EXT than COL on the OOG spreadsheet so I'm think EXT is required for one of these resources?) also covers a STO. 

So it will be enough to get me started, then I can bring more over if I want to build more extraction buildings


[29-May-22 10:47 AM] insensless72#0000
I have 1575 which I have been holding onto for this exact occasion. Do you want to take all of them?


[29-May-22 10:48 AM] allocater#0000

Depends on your playstyle. Ship building is essentially end game. So we beat the game months ago. Most of the old players are on cruise control. IMO the first couple months of this game are the most fun

Popular despotism is a thing, all you need is a charismatic face and a few emotional hot-button issues to stoke popularism and distract from the real issues

problem with those is that the supporters dont like it when you raise taxes

Hello Bank of OOG! I'm looking for financing to help expand my agricultural operations to KI-446b. To that end, I've made up a document detailing two possible expansion plans, asking for a loan of 115,000 AIC for a minimum viable base, or 237,220 AIC for a full base.

[26-Jun-22 06:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we can start with one third, or half base, and do another loan later. It will be hard to get all the population up front anyways.


[26-Jun-22 06:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this also makes it easier to repay

[26-Jun-22 06:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
the "Small base" shopping list was $114k, and 36k of that was earmarked for PSL (although that was market price, not sure what corp price would be) But I'll definitely go for that.


[26-Jun-22 06:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Hm, that's pushing the farms. I'm seeing usually ~12 burnables per farm per day. Less if I'm making rations. If I go the full 500 area base with 11 farms, I can do about 1 contact a day. With 3 farms and 1 fp I fill 1 burnable contract every 5 days


[26-Jun-22 07:49 PM] churavis#0000

You can have the bfabs on harmonia for that, full base, if you fly from there. 
If you make the contract 20d, this will already represent most of the loan. For the rest you can sell DW for 100k or so.


[27-Jun-22 11:14 AM] allocater#0000
but we should probably combine DLRs resources on Kioog, so that you can build the full base with just 1 ship flying there.

Yup, it has a good population for FIM and eventually other high level foods. Right now my RATs sell on Harmonia, and there's a decent chance they get shipped offworld anyway. Plus there's other RAT producers on Harmonia


[29-Jul-22 06:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then I can deconstruct my FPs on harmonia and replace them with HYFs, and make coffee on Nike too.

I think a better way to borrow money is to provide a complete set of base materials for the shortage of materials such as rat, C and al, and then repay them in 60 days.

[04-Sep-22 09:49 AM] balbar#0000
Thanks for the invite and the offer! In that case I'll send you a contract on Phobos (got DW there). Not 100% sure what the best next step.  I was thinking on getting some H2O up on Ice station Alpha. Or is there something else that would help more right now?


[04-Sep-22 09:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
I was pretty interested in an Ice Station Alpha base myself, but when I checked the price it was about triple an Etherwind base due to the INS you'd need to buy. You might want to check my math on that though.


[04-Sep-22 09:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
And HSE


[04-Sep-22 10:01 AM] balbar#0000
Yeah, those are a big issue. 7 jumps to etherwind is annoying, but probably still better than dealing with that all the time...flightime to etherwind is like 50% more but still...


[04-Sep-22 10:17 AM] balbar#0000
Huh...Costs for an ice station alpha base are about 2x an etherwind base, but net profit is about the same according to PRUNner


[04-Sep-22 10:35 AM] allocater#0000
the daily profit does not consider the initial base costs, right?


[04-Sep-22 10:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
Profit in Prunner is without building costs or depreciation. Prunner has the payback period on the left side if you want that information


[04-Sep-22 10:43 AM] balbar#0000
Net profit at least includes depreciation. But yeah, about 2x as long to pay back(same base CM, 3x HB1, 10 RIG, with CoGC on and H20 price set to 25)

@paxmagellanic Welcome officially to OOG. As mentioned with our newest members above, we like to offer an initial 200k investment package. This is not a loan and does not need to be paid back. All you need to do is sell me 1 DW on the planet of your choice for 200k

{Reactions}
❤️ 😮 🎉 

[08-Sep-22 03:43 PM] jackinabox86#0000
@OOG Shareholder I know I'm alone against the world in loving a formal bank, so I gave up on that and wrote up a quick draft bank policy we could throw on our welcome page and sticky here that gives a short explainer on how the bank works so that it isn't so confusing for new members.  I did not include the new "investment package" Insenseless has been funding since we seem to think that's best revealed after a trial.  If anyone has any edits, objections, or other ideas fire away.  I also included a bit to consider on the suggested shipping tip idea.

Proposed language to add to welcome page:

**Bank of OOG: **The corp "bank" is not a formal bank, but members of the corp are encouraged to request expansion financing from veteran members of the corp in the Bank of OOG Discord channel, particularly for bases that produce materials in high demand such as RATs, AL, or C.  Typically loans will be around the 200-400k range and can repaid interest free over periods from 20-60 days.  Opportunities to repay with materials produced versus cash may be available.  Other special financing may be available and the corporation may proactively offer loans for specific high-need projects as well (for example, a new HE base).  If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the bank channel or message any officer.

Booger bank is funny, but we should probably either change all references to that or go back to Bank of OOG for clarity.

There was a 9 to 2 result on the survey in favor of a suggested tip for shipping contracts, but there have only been 3 votes on the level of a suggested tip (all for 5/[t][m]).  Could add that to the shipping section of the Welcome page: "Suggested tip for in-corp shipping contracts is 5/t or m, whichever is larger."  Could also just hold off given the minimal engagement with the poll on suggested tip levels though.

Because it is also a festival to enjoy food,  you can also get the equivalent FIM/WIN/GIN/ALE from me on ANT instead.

Do you have cash laying around uselessly? 💰Deposit it in OOG Bank! 🏦 Now offering 1% interest per week. 📈

To keep accounting simple deposits are only available in 1, 2 or 5 million.


[29-Jan-23 10:13 AM] gladeowl#0000
Oh. @allocater are we still doing the 200k beginner bonus? If so, can I send you 200k for the next person?


[29-Jan-23 10:13 AM] allocater#0000
yes, each new member gets 200k welcome money

I bet you could make 1% per week interest on the fact that sometimes people quit without remembering where they put their money 😆


[08-Feb-23 03:20 PM] churavis#0000
I'm quite certain that's what all crypto currencies, ponzi schemes and gift cards rely on to be at all profitable.


[09-Feb-23 12:09 AM] habix3956#0000
In my country we have a so called "happy-happy clan". They are convincing people that money makes you miserable and that all you problems will go away if you get rid of it; then you'll be happy. People even took loans to pay them lol. (no ponzi scheme needed). The police is shutting them down but every time a new guru pops up 😅


[09-Feb-23 12:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
Our "happy-happy clan" here claims that it will make you rich.😆


[09-Feb-23 12:14 AM] habix3956#0000
Yeah so does this happy-happy clan. Altho I guess I'm too dumb how you'll get rich by taking a loan and giving money away to your master 😄

The bank is now operating an EDC base on Malahat from which the interests are payed. Any amount of million can now be deposited.


[17-Feb-23 02:54 PM] allocater#0000
I don't know if I can get enough r-fabs in 5 days for the second base, but in general I am looking for a Malahat EDC base operator.
You never have to visit it, all import and export will be over LM.
Payment will be ~50k/day by selling every 100 EDC to the bank at 2000/u


[19-Feb-23 05:56 AM] neth_havoc#0000
So you will provide all consumables and i could help the corp with 1 (?) Base permit?


[19-Feb-23 06:01 AM] allocater#0000

the first part of the base will arrive in 10h, you can already buy on the LM for 1 AIC:

2000 MCG
80 TRU
4 LDE
4 LSE
4 LTA
12 PSL


[19-Feb-23 06:25 AM] allocater#0000
the final base will look like this and I will try to get all r-fabs before the pop report in 3days so your base fills up with ENG

[22-Mar-23 01:07 PM] allocater#0000
next EDC base is ready, as always:
* free base teleport
* free consumables in 50d packs (if possible)
* selling EDC for 3k to the bank

ideal for low effort / semi-retirement or base income for new players

base teleport still collecting dust on Malahat instead of printing money! and there are also unemployed ENG now

I'm mostly done wrapping up my asset sales, so I've got a 2 million AIC dividend available for any active OBCM corp member.  Just sell me a DW or something at ANT.  I may have additional funds to send as well and a few goods to auction that don't sell at a CX.  I figured cash was a better departing gift than the inequitable fire sale of materials at random planets, so hopefully this is useful, particularly to any newer members

If you don't want it, it'll go to Allocater, but the bank funds don't get used all that much so it makes sense for you all to build a new base or level your HQs

Gave my remaining 28 million to Allocater for the bank/corp.  I'm sure if you want some of it for a ship or base, he'll share it out.  With that donation to the bank, my previous deposit of 20 million, and my 37 million in dividends, that's 85 million.  Was a lot of fun!

[17-May-23 11:52 AM] churavis#0000
We might need it. I'm still not clear on whether the building is a one time building expense or if there will be multiple levels that will reach require more and more Afabs.

Yeah.


[17-May-23 11:59 AM] archielvahr#0000

126 for consumables

it would be nice if there would be a list with how much you can lend at what interest


[27-Jul-23 12:27 PM] allocater#0000
there are no real rules, usually it's zero-interest if it is <3mil. More millions we should probably charge 2% / week since the depositors get 1%, so the bank does not go bankrupt 😄


[27-Jul-23 12:28 PM] rune_242#0000

Regarding the GKI stock offering:
OOG's bank bought about 1k shares at 49,370 AIC 
(~49m worth)
The current valuation of shares is  71,874 (+45.6%)... and there seems to be appetite for people to buy more shares at that price. Should the bank be offering ~100 shares to sell at a higher price like 90,000? I feel like there might be buyers, and that's a pretty respectable number to cash-out on in a short time


[20-Sep-23 01:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I only have 100 shares, but I am considering it just to see what the appetite is for ongoing trades.

which is still tangentially tied to the profitability of the company via demand, at least assuming the market is reasonable. Lately, I guess that's not been that case


[20-Sep-23 03:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
rising metrics are a nice to have... better to FOMO people into buying the shares though, or do some sort of gamestop pumping thing.


[20-Sep-23 03:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
but the valuation number that comes from an authoritative source is a really nice "anchor"


[20-Sep-23 03:26 PM] melon164#0000
Gotta make it seem like there's limited supply for that though, not splashing ten shares around like there's liquidity or something 😜


[20-Sep-23 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was gonna do 50 but everyone else is throwin' out individual shares 😛


[20-Sep-23 06:21 PM] dehzhas#0000
Yeah, the liquidation price is only there as a way to create a floor for the price in this artificial universe that doesn’t have an actual stock market. I needed a way to give people a guaranteed “exit” price or the risk would be way higher. My hope is that eventually the liquidation price is never the price the shares actually trade at.

25% bump on liquidation price is nice to see

Hm I figured it would keep rolling - also maybe soem fresh blood who missed the IPO, but no comments from the PRUN discord when I mentioned it there


[20-Sep-23 09:59 PM] exeler#0000
If the idea gathers some steam/interest maybe someone could make a tool to track shareholders and facilitate trading of shares.


[20-Sep-23 11:22 PM] dehzhas#0000
I’m also planning to try to get other companies into the IPO game. I have a rough idea of how to bootstrap an additional few IPOs, but I’m still a bit away from making it a reality.


[20-Sep-23 11:24 PM] dehzhas#0000
I have plans 😊


[20-Sep-23 11:25 PM] dehzhas#0000
Your early investment in GKI is going to pay off insanely well, but I can’t get into specifics or it will become insider trading

One thing about that discord is it’s extremely spotty on response. It’s highly time of day dependent.

yeah the bank just scooped up the remaining shares as backup, we can sell it forward if interest is now higher than during IPO


[21-Sep-23 04:04 AM] allocater#0000
we can set a sell wall at something like 1.5*liquidationprice

I’m basically hoping to just keep my cash reserves in the bank and just get some basic interest on it since I don’t have the time for more creative options yet.

The bulk of my profits go to dividends, but I don’t like money just sitting there doing nothing

I've heard of some logistics companies making their profits purely on dividends as they buy products and sell those same products for the exact same prices


[09-Dec-23 01:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
they just invest the money they receive from the sale before the order is fulfilled by the manufacturer

I guess you could do the same thing sort of

does anyone want to play Malahat secretary? It involves 28 contract templates that have to be sent between 6 people every 50/90 days. It pays 1.05mil per week. (175k per base)


[01-Jan-24 11:30 AM] exeler#0000
Would this be something that the bot could help with?


[01-Jan-24 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
At this point in the game, I’d be happy to do a bit of clicking for 1.05 mil a week - don’t have any ships or bases in the area though, so I might not be the right one for the job


[01-Jan-24 05:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can do it too.  I assume you have a good set of suppliers in place already for the rfabs and other consumables.


[01-Jan-24 05:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
also related to the bank... I was thinking of offering to act as a broker to sell ~10-20% the OOG bank's shares of GKI next time there's a report and a flurry of activity. Shares are really only sold among shareholders now, and the market is probably bigger than that


[02-Jan-24 01:05 PM] allocater#0000
cool, you don't need any ships or bases, just a warehouse on malahat.

then you request from me:

1890    FIM
2700    DW
270    GIN
135    MED
54    VG
54    HSS

I have the LBH, LDE, and LSE (no LTA) on ANT. Feel free to send contracts to me if you didn't already send them to allocater

@allocater How many R-Fabs are still needed?


[22-Apr-24 09:21 AM] allocater#0000
demand has increased in sync with the supply, so over the next weeks I am still buying:

RBH 300
RDE 500
RSE 500
RTA 300


[22-Apr-24 09:22 AM] melon164#0000
I just put another 100 RBH on to cook, done in 5d

[22-Apr-24 09:37 AM] melon164#0000
Although it looks like I should probably do RDE or RSE 🤔


[22-Apr-24 09:37 AM] allocater#0000
depends on the profit, but since logistics.app is down, I don't know anymore what the prices are to equalize all 4 r-fabs 😦


[22-Apr-24 09:38 AM] churavis#0000
The funnest part of the game is building your own spreadsheet to calculate profits and costs and everything else


[22-Apr-24 09:39 AM] allocater#0000
so who has r-fab spreadsheet? 😄


[22-Apr-24 09:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
Prunplanner can do a cost-of-goods calculation if that's sort of what you're looking for:

[24-Apr-24 08:52 AM] allocater#0000
how is our internal FIM production? Anybody interested in regularly producing/shipping FIM to malahat? A full freighter of 3600 FIM would be worth 6.2mil


[24-Apr-24 09:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have a ton of extra FIM production, I just had a big stockpile


[24-Apr-24 10:24 AM] domicius#0000
I could probably make more FIM. Make lots of the raw ingredients, and just about enough FIM and MEA for myself. I'll look into Malahat


[24-Apr-24 10:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
i usually end up with quite a bit of FIM


[24-Apr-24 10:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
not going to ship to malahat though


[24-Apr-24 10:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
I've just reorganized my bases (and opened a new one) to make a small amount of excess FIM


[24-Apr-24 10:38 AM] allocater#0000
that's ok you can also sell it on ANT to me at any time


[24-Apr-24 10:39 AM] allocater#0000
if the EDC plan goes well, it will shift profits away from the EDC bases and give more profit to the FIM and R-fab bases. We can be there to collect those profits.


[24-Apr-24 10:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
i average out about 900+ FIM a week from project payouts, I sell at 1500/u typically


[24-Apr-24 10:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
think I've got a thousand or so atm just sitting at ANT unless I liquidated them, meant to buy a ship but the person I intend to do so with went on vacation


[24-Apr-24 10:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think I make about 600 FIM a week. May be able to ~~double that~~ get to 1000 if I slow down on RATs

"brake master cylinder" is a band, I think "electronic data core" would be a good band name too


[26-Apr-24 02:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
electronic data core is my new aesthetic


[26-Apr-24 02:38 PM] katinga#0000
REM is a band.  REO is a band.  ELO is a band.  Why not EDC?


[26-Apr-24 03:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
@katinga  since you're an OOG member, just send me a contract to sell EDC at 3000/u whenever 🙂


[26-Apr-24 03:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
just to clarify, is there a recommended limit for amount to request in one go? i'd like to keep this as a rainy day fund for whenever i need something, so it could sit for a while


[26-Apr-24 03:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
if it's over 1000 EDC at a time, i might need a day or two of notice


[26-Apr-24 03:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
but beyond that, go crazy 😄


[26-Apr-24 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
I wouldn't be surprised if they kept reducing the EDC MM though, so be mindful of that


[26-Apr-24 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
as much as i despise (despite giving in) to mms, the nearly what was it, one day of notice? seemed really scummy


[26-Apr-24 03:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I didn't see the detailed patch notes until it was nearly upon us


[26-Apr-24 03:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
cause it wasn't listed in the main update details


[26-Apr-24 03:29 PM] Deleted User#0000

[26-Apr-24 03:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
how dare they


[26-Apr-24 03:31 PM] allocater#0000
the imaginary contract says we buy at 3000 no matter the MM, so that risk is on us 😅


[26-Apr-24 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
a nice subtle (subject to change) would solve that issue quite nicely


[26-Apr-24 03:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
although retroactively changing that would be scummy


[26-Apr-24 03:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think we've still got a ways to go before this becomes unprofitable though


[26-Apr-24 03:38 PM] allocater#0000
I think we are pretty close already to break even


[26-Apr-24 03:40 PM] allocater#0000
actually break even seems to be 6000


[26-Apr-24 03:41 PM] allocater#0000
8500 if we pay operators 75k/day


[26-Apr-24 03:41 PM] sidepipe#0000

9500 is needed to pay operator and secretary

10400 needed to pay operator, secretary, taxes and investors


[26-Apr-24 03:46 PM] allocater#0000
9800 without investors


[26-Apr-24 03:46 PM] allocater#0000

Apparently in March 2022 (right before I started), these MMs were nerfed a bit. 
    SDR buys at 72000 (was 80000)
    SRD buys at 53000 (was 55000)
    ADR buys at 48000 (was 53000)
    UTS buys at 2200 (was 2500)


[26-Apr-24 03:49 PM] archielvahr#0000

Is anybody tired of the EDC base and wants to exit? This is a good moment because, we have hit the ENG cap and would give the base to a new player.

If you have a EDC base, post your ENG numbers, so we get some data about how distribution works.

My next repair is in 22 days. I can switch at any time. (probably makes sense to have someone closer to repair time to be the one to switch.) Caveat is that I need 1 or 2 STO to hold all my governor crap


[17-May-24 10:36 AM] allocater#0000
you are the lowest repair timer, but I am too lazy to calculate the switch modulos so we can probably go with the lowest 😄

3 permit now has: 1128 / 1170 ENG

I think you can do a stable loan with 0 interest and tweak the payout time to be longer after the contract is made too, or something like that 🤷‍♂️

Early loan repayment causes loss of total duration
I’ve been using (and loving!) the loan contracts, but a common issue that comes up with many people I make loans to is the loss of loan time when a user pays a payment early.  As an example, I might make a 2 week, 1m AIC loan with a very small weekly payment. A few hours after I pay out the 1m, the loan recipient sees a row reading:  6d, 21hr, P...

Hello, theoretically, what is the most one can borrow from oog bank?


[22-Jul-24 09:24 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Let’s say I wanted to borrow like 20 mil more, is that in the realm of possibilities?


[22-Jul-24 09:46 AM] allocater#0000
yes, everything beyond the first 5mil for 0%, is 1% interest per week. We have not discussed a limit so far 😄


[22-Jul-24 09:47 AM] allocater#0000
maybe at a certain amount we have to increase to 2% to secure against game-quitting-risk


[22-Jul-24 10:36 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Good to know, I’m still at the planning phase for my next expansion but first I wanted to see what was the available credit


[22-Jul-24 01:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I feel like the risk gets bigger since, if someone's prime enjoyment is expanding, what fun do they get once that's no longer in the cards except every couple of months?


[22-Jul-24 01:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
When I was originally giving out grants, they were 250k, cause that's what it approximately took to fill out the rest of your 500 area on a starter planet. So it gets you past the really slow ramp up, right to where you can support yourself for your first expansion.


[22-Jul-24 01:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Back then bfabs were half the price though


[22-Jul-24 01:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, I'd say tens of millions all at once is really quite a lot, I think it'd be better to serve it out over time

{Reactions}
👍 

[22-Jul-24 01:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
even a full AML base is less than that, I think


[22-Jul-24 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I’m trying to balance the risk versus the thought that idle and unused capital is a bit of a waste. The Malahat farms are a really good way to make the capital earn money, so that’s been cool. As far as loans, I think the community has only really been burnt once on those. Lowstrifes loans almost always get paid back he says


[22-Jul-24 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
But still a tiered line-of-credit style loan maximum could work for that.  Or if the goal is to prevent "I took a loan and hit endgame and I have nothing left to do" then the policy could be HQ-based: "If you are above HQ level 14, then you can get a loan for one HQ level + a base at a time".


[22-Jul-24 01:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
🤷‍♂️


[22-Jul-24 01:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My logic (which could be flawed) is that the real blockers are ships. If I want to expand and cover the ship loan, it needs to be in a big enough increment as to be able to plop down enough bases to cover the base loan and the ship loan


[22-Jul-24 01:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Now I do realize that the amount I’m asking is a lot so this is why I was enquiring as to the bank policy up front before effort going into the weeds of planning the expansion


[22-Jul-24 01:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I could borrow 20-30 mil easy in the open market but the 1-2% here is the biggest appeal


[22-Jul-24 02:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
This being said, regarding the concern that my interest in the game is only expansion, it is actually genuinely to be one of the richest/biggest in the game. 
So I’ll still see myself as in the early game until I hit 20ish base which I’m from far still


[22-Jul-24 02:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's true that HQs don't get expensive til about 21


[22-Jul-24 02:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I do think loans to members is the best use of capital


[22-Jul-24 02:08 PM] melon164#0000

Hello all, as alluded to earlier this week, I would like to enquire about taking a big loan, ideally in the range of 30 mil to buy a new ship and 5-6 new bases in Mor. 

This would bring me from 13-18/19 base after which I would take some time to consolidate et service the debt. 

Let me know if you require any information or if you have any questions


[26-Jul-24 01:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Ideal duration would be 10-12 weeks as I would need a bit of time to get everything setup and won’t be able to generate income straight away


[26-Jul-24 02:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Bases in Moria? 😱


[26-Jul-24 02:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
With the number of bases, aiming at lower cost planets is important. 
Moria is fully untapped for me right now


[26-Jul-24 02:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[26-Jul-24 02:58 PM] allocater#0000
Hi, yeah, fine by me, better somebody does something cool with the money. Our highest investment so far was 50mil. That might be lost though (for now) until Dehz resumes activities. 

I would say we go up to 2% interest per week and you can set your payment plan as you prefer in the contract. I will accept it.


[26-Jul-24 02:59 PM] allocater#0000
you can also choose currencies in any fraction


[26-Jul-24 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
out of curiosity, what are the base products of the new bases?


[26-Jul-24 04:01 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

Would kinda need to borrow 6 extra million... I dont mind paying higher interest considering the amount i already have loan out

We do have room for another couple IDC bases on Malahat, would be good to keep that going 🙂


[01-Aug-24 03:31 AM] akyantor#0000
What does it cost to stand up and IDC base? tbh, not ever looked. *I wouldn't say no to the extra income stream... would help accelerate other plans*


[01-Aug-24 03:32 AM] akyantor#0000
Wow... 15-16m at market prices. 😱


[01-Aug-24 07:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
That’s why we offer IDC bases through the bank of OOG 🙂


[01-Aug-24 02:43 PM] akyantor#0000
If I were to ask for a modest loan, say somewhere between 2-3 million how does the duration work? *Thinking about accelerating the next couple of steps in my plan, that should add another 200k or so per day profit (could be more like 150k, as I mostly sell stuff to corp at lower prices).*


[01-Aug-24 02:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think the standard is 0 interest, 60 days, but allocater will know for sure 🙂

We calculate 25mil because a 50day supply package is included, see malahat chat pinned posts on how to get it


[01-Aug-24 02:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
One advice, consider the cost of first loading the base as well


[01-Aug-24 02:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Its easy to have no cash left to get the base going


[01-Aug-24 03:02 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd need to sequence the bases going live anyway to avoid a supply chain issue. But yes, will factor in initial consumables.

Would it be possible to get a loan to fund the afab/rfab HQ upgrades from 13->17 for the AWH project? I think I'd need about 4m to buy them. It would remove this particular hump from my expansion plans, as a side benefit the excess permits (in the short term) will accelerate production of IDC on the OOG sponsored base on Malahat.

@allocater @archielvahr things are going quite well at Shrewdbank and I have a lot of demand with loans. I was curious to see what was happening with OOG unused liquidities and if there was interest in putting it in Shrewdbank to gain some interest


[22-Aug-24 09:13 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Currently I can garanty 2% on any deposit but that could be negotiated for a little more if than tips the needle


[22-Aug-24 09:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I am low on liquid cash but there might be older members who are interested, who are sitting on cash. Not sure.


[22-Aug-24 11:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's 2% weekly, yes?


[23-Aug-24 03:04 AM] allocater#0000
OOG Bank can deposit up to 100m with you in currencies of your choosing.

@allocater can I give you some money to keep secret and safe?


[12-Nov-24 12:46 PM] allocater#0000
of course

[12-Nov-24 12:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
uh 5 mil work?


[12-Nov-24 12:47 PM] allocater#0000
yes, whatever you want to deposit, 5 mil generates 50k per week in interest

Could someone convert 800k CIS to AIC for me?


[14-Nov-24 10:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can if you send me contracts! Allocater will do currency swaps, but they might not be online right now


[14-Nov-24 10:29 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Thanks, what's your conversion ratio?


[14-Nov-24 10:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
One to one


[14-Nov-24 10:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
1:1 😎


[14-Nov-24 10:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
I would never extract surplus value from my corpmates through currency conversions - that’s what auctions are for 😄

{Reactions}
😂 

[14-Nov-24 10:31 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I was looking to get out of some AIC into some CIS.. Happy to do 1:1 as well on the 800k unless you need it, @sidepipe


[14-Nov-24 10:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, go for it - I keep around plenty of all currencies 🙂


[14-Nov-24 10:32 PM] superbadsounds#0000
Word. Hit me up, @shinonomesciences


[14-Nov-24 10:33 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I'll cancel the contract with sidepipe then

[14-Nov-24 10:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
Actually, now that I think of it, I might have sold you some CIS on the FX earlier today 😄


[14-Nov-24 10:35 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I'm sure you did 😉


[14-Nov-24 10:37 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
You know, if everyone made a concerted effort to sell cheap items on foreign local markets, we could potentially artificially induce a demand for AIC via the trade deficit 🤔

[14-Nov-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Gotta break the NCC dominance somehow 😄


[14-Nov-24 10:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Seems like everyone wants to trade NCC for other stuff, so you end up with lots of it (because things in Moria are more expensive, so they seem to import a lot for profit)


[14-Nov-24 10:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
At least anecdotally based on FX experience


[14-Nov-24 10:41 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Actually, yeah, I got it backwards, you'd have to have an outflow of your own currency for people to use it as a reserve


[14-Nov-24 10:42 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Is there a chart somewhere that shows the amounts of each currency in circulation?


[14-Nov-24 10:44 PM] sidepipe#0000

[14-Nov-24 10:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
Archiel has a sheet somewhere that has several months worth of the economic reports in it, but I don’t have the link handy


[14-Nov-24 11:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Both sides of the NCC to AIC FX trades are very close to under 1:1. NCC is hard to get rid of


[14-Nov-24 11:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will probably buy a bunch of items on the market. But usually, I try to find things that are cheaper than they are in ant and I’m not sure I can find anything that I actually want

~~hellooo :D, could I get a 2mil loan with 8 weeks repayment time?~~


[17-Mar-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
hmm, not sure actually

[17-Mar-25 11:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah but I dont really need 5 mil cuz I have no idea what to do with all that, and 60 days repayment time would bankrupt me...


[17-Mar-25 11:23 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think it’s up to 5 million?


[17-Mar-25 11:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
I mean, what I proposed origionally is the same as what allocator proposed, but 2 mil instead of 5mil


[17-Mar-25 11:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
60days and 8weeks are about the same


[17-Mar-25 11:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
the thing is I can afford 250k a week, not 625k tho


[17-Mar-25 11:25 AM] allocater#0000
yeah you can send a modified contract


[17-Mar-25 11:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
I want to get into loan business soon so I think it will be a good start for me. I can do 2 mil in what ever duration you prefer


[17-Mar-25 11:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
^ im not sure tho, I need to know that I can actually make that money back


[17-Mar-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
well I. just need to build a bit of safety net first I guess


[17-Mar-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
then it shouldnt matter


[17-Mar-25 11:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
mannn.. theres too much to think about😔


[17-Mar-25 11:27 AM] .urpalhal#0000
