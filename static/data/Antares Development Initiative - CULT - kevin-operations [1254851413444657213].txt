@tanda @evany. let me know what the PP plans look like and I'll offer you that 25% grant. (someone?) can provide the other 75% as a loan


[25-Jun-24 10:31 PM] pi3142718#0000
Although I remember something about the full loan being given... I'll just pay you the 25% then


[25-Jun-24 10:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can provide the other 75% üôÇ


[25-Jun-24 10:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
@razesdark already got the loan for the full amount - so either PiBoy can pay him the 25% or I can

[25-Jun-24 11:28 PM] pi3142718#0000
What‚Äôs the total come to? Can‚Äôt see it on shared links for some reason


[25-Jun-24 11:34 PM] jvaler#0000
i think that's intended, cause it doesn't know what kind of CX settings you want to use. you'd have to click copy plan and assign your own empire to it

[26-Jun-24 12:38 AM] evany.#0000
1.88 now that i'm in front of my pc


[26-Jun-24 04:54 AM] razesdark#0000
Cool! Since the base is all but constructed already, the 25% grant will come in clutch for me to get my first WCB! Also @tanda, would it be possible to get 500 of the 1k C at ANT within a the next few days?


[26-Jun-24 06:46 AM] tanda#0000
I brought in almost all of the 1k about a day ago. I can send you a cont for the 500 C right now


[26-Jun-24 07:02 AM] razesdark#0000
I'm still at work for a few hours, no immediate rush. But getting two conts for 500 is fine by me. the 550k for 1k C is pretty much all my liquid funds


[26-Jun-24 07:08 AM] tanda#0000
no worries, I'll send it now. I'm about to head to work and it gets difficult to check in for the next 12 hours


[26-Jun-24 07:09 AM] tanda#0000
just for the first 500


[26-Jun-24 07:40 AM] razesdark#0000
üëå Perfect


[26-Jun-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
I am acknowledging receipt of the 25% grant from PiBoy314


[26-Jun-24 09:08 PM] tanda#0000
Alright, so my personal initial plan was to settle on Aceland. Do enough of us think it's probably a good idea to just shuffle PP2's off of Nike?

[28-Jun-24 09:56 AM] razesdark#0000
Has anyone here built their INS base and/or want to buy some of the PE generated so far?
If not, I'm considering just offloading some of the already produced stock on the market to improve my liquidity somewhat.


[28-Jun-24 10:02 AM] sidepipe#0000
If no one‚Äôs up and running yet, I‚Äôll buy some at CX price for my own INS factories üôÇ


[28-Jun-24 10:02 AM] razesdark#0000
I got 30k at ANT, its yours if you want it


[28-Jun-24 10:05 AM] sidepipe#0000
Deal! I‚Äôll send over a contract - feel free to wait to fill it for a bit in case anyone who has a Kevin base comes forward


[28-Jun-24 10:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
On that note, 2.5k of THF is ready to go at ANT for Kevin members


[28-Jun-24 10:07 AM] razesdark#0000
Sounds good!


[28-Jun-24 10:08 AM] tanda#0000
I will be dropping this weekend


[28-Jun-24 10:08 AM] tanda#0000
If you get built up again, shoot me a contract at CX price


[28-Jun-24 10:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
@tanda you're welcome to jump me in line if you want üôÇ


[28-Jun-24 10:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
Kevin must come first üòÑ

[28-Jun-24 10:16 AM] tanda#0000
There will be another couple days of production by that point. I'd expect closer to Sunday than Saturday. I have to move my pp2s to 759b


[28-Jun-24 10:20 AM] razesdark#0000
I can have 38k5 PE for you at ANT this time Sunday, I think


[28-Jun-24 10:21 AM] razesdark#0000
I can probably sell to both Side and Tanda then.
Unless evayoo is up and running as well


[28-Jun-24 11:22 AM] evany.#0000
i got the 25% from piboy but i haven't started to buy materials yet because i can't afford it yet


[28-Jun-24 12:21 PM] razesdark#0000
üëç


[28-Jun-24 03:05 PM] evany.#0000
should we send you a cont ? i dont know what @tanda 's plan is


[28-Jun-24 04:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yes- stable loan, 0 interest, 30 day interval in 2 payments is what I think the settings are


[28-Jun-24 05:50 PM] evany.#0000
i've never done that but ill give it a try


[28-Jun-24 06:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can send it if you prefer üôÇ


[28-Jun-24 07:58 PM] evany.#0000
i think i did it


[28-Jun-24 08:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
you did!


[28-Jun-24 08:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
just make sure not to pay back the first installment early


[28-Jun-24 08:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
because the 30 day timer for the second starts once you pay the first


[28-Jun-24 08:04 PM] evany.#0000
i guarantee ill scew it up somehow dont worry


[28-Jun-24 08:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
sounds good! then we'll just deal with that when it happens üòÑ


[28-Jun-24 08:06 PM] evany.#0000
every day or two i try to just go t hough everything and hit fulfill lmao


[28-Jun-24 09:55 PM] pi3142718#0000
I‚Äôll buy all the PE you‚Äôve got. But I‚Äôm also the market you‚Äôd offload to.


[28-Jun-24 10:11 PM] tanda#0000
just keep in mind that your base wasn't planned specifically to supply kevin's INS bases


[28-Jun-24 10:11 PM] tanda#0000
it was dropped to offset the increased demand on the CX


[28-Jun-24 10:11 PM] tanda#0000
so you can sell to whoever you want


[28-Jun-24 10:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Last thing we really need before starting is finding a home for every INS producer


[28-Jun-24 10:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
(And before we recruit the rest)


[28-Jun-24 10:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So Tanda is doing it on Nike


[28-Jun-24 11:00 PM] evany.#0000
I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going yet


[28-Jun-24 11:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So Nike is best because it actually has unemployed techs, but the next best places if we get the tech pop up would be Aceland and ZV-194b


[28-Jun-24 11:18 PM] avalock#0000
my workhorse ship (AII Garbiel) is transporting stuff to Nascent then heading to KI-401d


[28-Jun-24 11:20 PM] evany.#0000
I will look at those for whatever is closest to cx thanks


[28-Jun-24 11:21 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
None of them except Nike have techs yet so we need to say pretty please and ask for some tech growth


[28-Jun-24 11:23 PM] evany.#0000
Ahh


[29-Jun-24 03:06 AM] razesdark#0000
Yep. I sold off some since the bases arent constructed yet. I should have enough to supply your base for a week on sunday.


[29-Jun-24 03:10 AM] evany.#0000
my orders are out now so i should have components "soon" i hope


[29-Jun-24 03:10 AM] evany.#0000
i'm a bit concerned about staffing on the planet and popr i think is in like a week now since it wasj ust like 2 hours ago or so mething


[29-Jun-24 01:04 PM] razesdark#0000
Sweet. I'm going to start stockpiling for you and Tanda then.
Figure 40k each will be enough per week until you get a few experts


[29-Jun-24 01:14 PM] tanda#0000
I am honestly going to try not to take out a loan to do this. I may change my mind

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[29-Jun-24 01:43 PM] evany.#0000
I don‚Äôt either but I don‚Äôt think I can afford it with consumables without


[29-Jun-24 01:44 PM] evany.#0000
If I wasn‚Äôt trying to spool up another base simultaneously it‚Äôd be fine


[29-Jun-24 01:44 PM] evany.#0000
Like you, I suppose


[29-Jun-24 01:44 PM] tanda#0000
I think I can squeak through. PiBoy issued the 25% grant which should help a lot for consumables. I do have 4m currently, but I'm also having to move my PP2s off of Nike at the same time


[29-Jun-24 01:44 PM] tanda#0000
it'll be fiiiinee

[29-Jun-24 01:51 PM] razesdark#0000
Am I eligble for the 25% grant as well?


[29-Jun-24 02:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I asked for more techs at ZV-194b as well but it sounds like getting enough techs is a Sisyphean task


[29-Jun-24 02:21 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Ideally the new people we recruit don't have a Nike base yet and we can just forget about it


[29-Jun-24 02:21 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Increasing pops is something we can do as a project at some point too perhaps


[29-Jun-24 02:22 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Worst case we can just go somewhere without the correct CoGC and commandeer their techs


[29-Jun-24 02:23 PM] tanda#0000
I almost did a smooth move from Nike to 194b but I forgot that 194b was INS and not SEA


[29-Jun-24 02:23 PM] tanda#0000
so now I'm waiting for INS


[29-Jun-24 03:21 PM] pi3142718#0000
What are you making? Probably


[29-Jun-24 03:22 PM] tanda#0000
they're the Heph support base that's making PE


[29-Jun-24 03:22 PM] pi3142718#0000
Yeah. Let me know what the total is


[29-Jun-24 04:44 PM] razesdark#0000
Base cost was about 900k-1M


[29-Jun-24 05:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Include stock up cost for ~5 days. Should be closer to 1.25M I believe


[29-Jun-24 05:11 PM] razesdark#0000
That sounds about right


[29-Jun-24 05:19 PM] pi3142718#0000
Ok, I‚Äôll look at getting to it


[29-Jun-24 05:19 PM] pi3142718#0000
Ping me if I haven‚Äôt done it by tomorrow


[30-Jun-24 07:57 AM] razesdark#0000
@tanda I have about a week of PE ready for you in ANT.
Also would like to get another 500C if you have available


[30-Jun-24 10:03 AM] tanda#0000
I have it ready for you, I'll send a cont


[30-Jun-24 10:52 AM] razesdark#0000
Nice, ready for some PE as well?


[30-Jun-24 10:53 AM] tanda#0000
yes, how much are we talking? I'll send you a cont


[30-Jun-24 10:53 AM] razesdark#0000
I got 38k, should be enough for one week at 0 experts


[30-Jun-24 10:54 AM] tanda#0000
okay, I'll send one right now


[30-Jun-24 10:59 AM] razesdark#0000
That contract prices PE way higher than the KEVIN agreed price. You can have the PE for 323k if you want


[30-Jun-24 11:01 AM] tanda#0000
oh I just went with the current market rate


[30-Jun-24 11:01 AM] razesdark#0000
It hasn't been properly communicated, but its in the informations page


[30-Jun-24 11:01 AM] tanda#0000
oh cool, thanks. I'll resend


[30-Jun-24 11:05 AM] tanda#0000

I should be able to provide that in about two days. Production will not be full tilt for a week, but I'm still at 113% efficiency

worm, i wont have the money till then prob anyways


[01-Jul-24 04:05 PM] razesdark#0000
A little off topic, but do you have any TIO available Avacyn?


[01-Jul-24 04:07 PM] avalock#0000
i have some yeag


[01-Jul-24 04:07 PM] avalock#0000

i see 1 person that sells ALE in AA, but no SC/SCN - do i have to start paying attention to cx?


[01-Jul-24 05:55 PM] tanda#0000
I just bought them off the CX, I guess someone cleaned them out


[01-Jul-24 06:14 PM] avalock#0000
bid amount is 210, 200 TIO @ 200 good for you?


[01-Jul-24 06:14 PM] avalock#0000
I gotta get them to antares


[01-Jul-24 06:15 PM] razesdark#0000
Yes sounds fantastic. Ill take it


[01-Jul-24 06:15 PM] jcheung#0000
i was looking at BEN at them. they seem to have an okay stock of it when i looked 4 days ago


[01-Jul-24 06:17 PM] jcheung#0000
oh. never mind, all those prices went up


[03-Jul-24 10:04 AM] avalock#0000

@tanda I'll need to top off my C sometime within the next few days. Do you have some?
Also, I have another week or two of PE ready for you if you want it


[04-Jul-24 10:28 AM] tanda#0000
I have C in position for you on ANT whenever you're ready


[04-Jul-24 10:28 AM] tanda#0000
I will need PE here soon, but give me like two days before I pick it up


[05-Jul-24 01:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well the ZV-194b governor ignored me, I don't think the tech pop is booming there


[05-Jul-24 01:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also Aceland suddenly has 500 tech jobs open as opposed to ~100. Did somebody plop down a base ?


[05-Jul-24 01:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also also PG is 40$ again :(

{Reactions}
concern 

[05-Jul-24 01:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We'll have 10 PG bases by the end of this


[05-Jul-24 01:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But we will succeed !


[05-Jul-24 01:46 PM] avalock#0000
AR hopefully will be online sometime soon


[05-Jul-24 01:46 PM] avalock#0000
i have everything but INS


[05-Jul-24 07:01 PM] avalock#0000
AR should be set up by tomorrow, going to try reaching our goal of 280 I think it was (i forget tbh)


[05-Jul-24 07:01 PM] avalock#0000
probably go for more like 320 iirc


[05-Jul-24 07:02 PM] tanda#0000
I definitely went out of my way to put the PP3's on Nike, so the Aceland open jobs wasn't me


[05-Jul-24 07:13 PM] avalock#0000
I got all my notes set up for consumables, I'm excited for this job :D


[05-Jul-24 08:41 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Jacchus is a proxy governor for me, and they have been out of the game for a week in the hospital. What do you need?


[05-Jul-24 08:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Ah, sorry to hear that. Wish them luck


[05-Jul-24 08:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[05-Jul-24 08:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Copy. I find it unlikely Jacchus will be back in time for POPR, but i will build a Wildlife Park POPI and plug it in, and that will significant buoy the happiness for the following week


[05-Jul-24 08:43 PM] riseoffilth#0000
hopefully that help for next week üôÇ

I'm kinda tempted to take down my TIO base, but like... idk its just kinda vibin


[06-Jul-24 10:36 AM] avalock#0000
its very passive


[06-Jul-24 11:03 AM] tanda#0000
as long as its making you money?


[06-Jul-24 11:05 AM] razesdark#0000
I am always in the market for TIO


[06-Jul-24 11:06 AM] avalock#0000
yeag, tbh I should expand it a bit for like @razesdark I'm only producing 42/d


[06-Jul-24 01:13 PM] razesdark#0000
That is fine, for atm. When I finally get around to installing my last 4 smelters, I think I will be in the 50's every day.


[06-Jul-24 01:13 PM] razesdark#0000
Though I am tempted to add another permit to my smelter base and expand it a bit further

@razesdark When you get a chance, I'd like to buffer another 40k PE if you have it


[09-Jul-24 12:59 AM] razesdark#0000
I need to move some from heph. Gimme a few hours and I can do it


[09-Jul-24 05:37 AM] razesdark#0000
I got up to 52k in Ant in 4 hours, make a cont for the amount you want up to that and I'll fulfill it when I can.


[09-Jul-24 06:56 AM] tanda#0000
I sent you a cont for 40k, thank you!


[09-Jul-24 09:57 AM] avalock#0000
@tanda i should be able to do the other half of the INS i need, would you be willing to do like an INS for AR type trade? i have 192 AR currently (sorry am producing 105/d atm)


[09-Jul-24 09:58 AM] avalock#0000
my other bases like also needed food basically on the dame day lol


[09-Jul-24 09:58 AM] avalock#0000
but i can also pay you AIC as well


[09-Jul-24 09:59 AM] avalock#0000
so i figure it‚Äôs I sell you AR -> I buy INS off of you


[09-Jul-24 12:14 PM] tanda#0000
That should be fine, that's the next mat I need to buy anyway. I'll check it out and send a cont when I get home


[09-Jul-24 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
you wouldn't happen to need this INS on KI-401d? Do you want me to haul it out there for you, since I have to pick up the AR?


[09-Jul-24 09:16 PM] tanda#0000
@avalock how much INS did you still need? 1500?


[10-Jul-24 02:15 AM] avalock#0000
1825 i believe


[10-Jul-24 06:48 AM] razesdark#0000
Evayoo, I saw your contract, but it was for Rations, not PE.
I can do that amount tomorrow, I need to haul some more

no problem, you can cont me for whatever AR you have, I'll have to come out there and get it out all at once (apparently one way uses more than 50% of fuel

How many kevin bases do we have running INS right now? Just 2, correct? (and on that note, could someone share their base's THF consumption at 5 experts? wanna make sure I make enough. I remember 284 THF / day was for the full 4 bases, so 71/day/base?)


[11-Jul-24 09:15 AM] avalock#0000

[11-Jul-24 10:37 AM] riseoffilth#0000
Not even the Governor and all of parliament can vote to make POPR happen faster

i dont know how governor things work


[11-Jul-24 10:38 AM] evany.#0000
but if theres a building that needs building


[11-Jul-24 10:38 AM] evany.#0000
i know jvaler is excited to pay for it


[11-Jul-24 10:38 AM] evany.#0000
cuz it was mentioned that it might take several weeks to get workers


[11-Jul-24 10:40 AM] riseoffilth#0000
Yeah, I seem to recall there being a tech deficit


[11-Jul-24 10:41 AM] evany.#0000
idk if its something you two can do something about when you take over


[11-Jul-24 10:41 AM] evany.#0000
either way i will just wait.. just wanted to make sure someone had eyes on it that might actually be able to influence change


[11-Jul-24 10:41 AM] evany.#0000
thank


[11-Jul-24 10:41 AM] riseoffilth#0000
Kinda sorta? Rog can more immediately poke at it as he is gov for another week still


[11-Jul-24 10:42 AM] riseoffilth#0000
But if you want extra programs run, Cough up some space bucks for programs


[11-Jul-24 10:42 AM] evany.#0000
how much are we talking


[11-Jul-24 10:43 AM] evany.#0000
i owe this rise guy and sidepipe guy atm so not a lot of space bucks


[11-Jul-24 10:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
we can figure out space bucks - I can pay for some immigration or education programs, whichever would be faster


[11-Jul-24 11:13 AM] razesdark#0000
@evany. Sent you a fixed contract for PE since the one I got a few days ago was for RAT

[11-Jul-24 11:21 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I suggest letting the governor of a planet know you're gonna be building a base that requires more POPs than are unemployed on the planet. 
...Unless you expect governors to be psychic?


[11-Jul-24 11:23 AM] evany.#0000
from what i understood we did three-four weeks ago and it went so well that people moved to nike

im hoping that you/rise taking over soon(tm) will fix that and wanted to bring it to your attention to ask if theres something i can do to contribute/help


[11-Jul-24 11:28 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
3 weeks ago... *checks notes* ah right. Previous administration.
Aight, well, you did your part. Looks like it will take 2-3 weeks to get all the POPs you need.


[11-Jul-24 11:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you decide to run programs on Aceland for tec immigration or education, let me know - I'm happy to pay for it üôÇ

Argon hitting 278 per day, might go down tomorrow since I need to get a ship out there to send some needs there

I'm gonna expand it a bit (realized I relaly only need 2 STO instead of 3 STO, I think it allows for more rigs)


[14-Jul-24 11:32 AM] evany.#0000
Sto is 15, so one more rig maybe 2?

If you have any empty space I can fill it


[14-Jul-24 05:14 PM] tanda#0000
same, I have some AR sitting out there, but it's only worth running a ship out there if it's full. To make it worse, it's like 55% FF to get out there

[19-Jul-24 07:05 AM] avalock#0000
hmmmmm it would be nice if i could make a base out in Elon and have it as a middle ground while mining there


[19-Jul-24 07:06 AM] tanda#0000
there's some decent options, but I think it's all stuff you'd want to refine on site

[21-Jul-24 09:31 AM] evany.#0000
yeah- actually if its at antares i'm sure theres no worries about holding so just split it 50/50


[21-Jul-24 10:03 AM] pi3142718#0000
Looks like just over 16k INS produced last week between you two. Definitely moving up in the ranks


[21-Jul-24 10:03 AM] pi3142718#0000
Although you‚Äôll need more to get to your goal üôÇ

I'm modifying one of my ships to be able to make that trip with no issue

I'm upgrading a bit of the production at KI-401, I need some BSE


[21-Jul-24 11:12 AM] avalock#0000
And then upgrade my ALO production


[21-Jul-24 11:14 AM] tanda#0000
I need to swap over to making a lot of BSE here in the next few days, but 194b is currently producing LFabs for a couple days to try to clean up some of this AL overstock

[23-Jul-24 04:55 PM] evany.#0000
Good question, @razesdark do we tax you ?

Even if we don‚Äôt currently I‚Äôd still say eventually it might be ideal I think we want at least two more ins people


[23-Jul-24 04:55 PM] razesdark#0000
No, not at all right now. 
I am selling quite a lot of excess atm


[23-Jul-24 05:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am a new player Currently have a base on Phobos 3 BMPs making 12k a day NET. Saving money to place a base on Hephaestus and relocate HQ there

My plan was in line what you guys need so I thought I would ask


[23-Jul-24 05:31 PM] marat_sh#0000
I get financing for a base and you get more PE for project Win-Win

Or you can make PG. We still need to lower it

Currently only planning on manufacturing (I am still new, wanna take baby steps before I burn out) I was going to expand into Hephaestus anyway that's why I've asked. We can still do some stuff in a future Thanks for answers though ü´°

I can split the haul with you, I have 8 days of AR left at this point so I'm not in critical need


[28-Jul-24 02:01 PM] tanda#0000
@avalock can we do something weird? Can you send me a shipping contract for the AR so it will auto-provision? And I'll buy it off you when I get it to ANT?


[28-Jul-24 02:01 PM] avalock#0000
sure!


[29-Jul-24 07:01 AM] tanda#0000

[29-Jul-24 08:19 AM] avalock#0000

[29-Jul-24 08:20 AM] avalock#0000
how much can you hold?


[29-Jul-24 01:09 PM] tanda#0000
1k AR


[30-Jul-24 07:13 PM] tanda#0000
how much did you need of the AR? I brought 1k in from KI-401d


[30-Jul-24 07:50 PM] evany.#0000
Good question I don‚Äôt know exactly how much I need


[30-Jul-24 07:51 PM] evany.#0000
Does anyone here a vcb that we could get to haul batches ?


[30-Jul-24 07:51 PM] evany.#0000
I mean really I‚Äôll take as much of it as I can


[30-Jul-24 07:51 PM] evany.#0000
I probably have less than 5 days worth


[30-Jul-24 07:52 PM] tanda#0000
I have 8 days remaining so if you need it I can spare all 1k


[30-Jul-24 07:53 PM] tanda#0000
what do we need a VCB for, though?


[30-Jul-24 08:13 PM] evany.#0000
So we can haul a shit tong of gas for like a month


[30-Jul-24 08:14 PM] evany.#0000
I‚Äôll check in the morning my pmmg has been fucked so I have no idea how much I have


[30-Jul-24 08:14 PM] tanda#0000
oh, AR is really close to 1:1, though leaning to the mass side. a 2k/2k is optimal, but outside of that a WCB will do best


[31-Jul-24 01:11 AM] evany.#0000
im about the same about 8 days. split it 50 50 ?


[31-Jul-24 05:58 AM] tanda#0000

[02-Aug-24 03:06 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Or INS for that matter


[02-Aug-24 03:39 PM] tanda#0000
Yes, but we don't need PE yet


[02-Aug-24 03:40 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
so INS?


[02-Aug-24 09:16 PM] pi3142718#0000
Yes. I'll give you a 25% grant towards an INS base + initial supplies and can offer the other 75% as a 0% interest loan


[02-Aug-24 09:16 PM] pi3142718#0000
Nike is likely the best location


[02-Aug-24 09:17 PM] pi3142718#0000
I'm of the opinion that a 9 PP3 + 2 LAB + 2 STO setup is the best, but others have different setups


[03-Aug-24 03:30 AM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Yeas i saw the peunplanner and thought to do it like that.
Is there a loan to get you set up. I talked ro okawari ,how he had done it


[03-Aug-24 03:44 AM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Or i could the intial ADI loan.(Never apllied for it) Then i will be able to settle the base. And the INS will slowly start to roll inn


[03-Aug-24 05:42 AM] pi3142718#0000
Yup. 0% interest loan for 75% of the cost and a 25% grant for the rest of it. Just send me a screenshot of the Prunplanner with the cost. I‚Äôm traveling today, so you‚Äôd have to send the contracts

[03-Aug-24 09:38 AM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Sounds nice. I will be back with the plan. I was just called to work for overtime so had to do my real job first


[03-Aug-24 11:08 AM] avalock#0000
Hey, this is a sub-project for the Kevin ~~CUTEAF~~ project I would like to call the "Express Transportation of Argon" aka ETA

- Problem:
 - The current Argon travel from KI-401 is expensive, and out of the way for most of our clients. 
 - AAT's current logistical set up is unable to meet the demands of a spread network 

- Goals:
 - Centralized Argon storage will allow downstream vendors to have a more affordable argon solution to INS production 
 - A static Argon transportation route will allow downstream vendors to prioritize their own logistics network, while also enhancing AAT's transportation of resources to KI-401d and potential (relative) South-east expansions

- Plan:
 - In order for AAT to fulfill the goals set fort by the paper AAT will need the following:
   - Creation of a blueprint to fulfill adequate transport of materails to and from Aceland <-> KI-401d
   - Investment in said ship
   - Investment in Aceland's Warehouse in order to have more space for imports and exports

- What we need:
AAT would love for collaboration from fellow members to help with creating a new ship in order to bring the price of raw resources down. In doing so, AAT will not only keep prices at 180 AIC/u, but also lower them by 5.5% to 170 AIC/u due to our rate of extraction. We require substantial investment in the form of cheaper ship parts, loans, and grants in order to fulfill our goals.

- Repayment

With a sizable project comes a sizable amount of repayment to our vendors and investors. AAT so far has no debt, but we would be willing to take some on for this project. Repayment would come in multiple forms
- For vendors down the line:
 - Less expensive materials
- For investors
 - Repayment in AIC through our profitable mining corportation.

I would like to thank you all for reading

[03-Aug-24 11:12 AM] avalock#0000
i'm unsure how much I could place there lmfao


[03-Aug-24 11:12 AM] tanda#0000
the warehouse maximum is 3k/3k right now


[03-Aug-24 11:12 AM] tanda#0000
if you're just looking for a distro base, that's super cheap as just a CM and maybe 3-4 STOs


[03-Aug-24 11:13 AM] tanda#0000
I literally have the parts for a CM sitting in a warehouse on Aceland right now


[03-Aug-24 11:13 AM] avalock#0000

I think we can definitely get you set up with another permit then üôÇ


[03-Aug-24 11:18 AM] tanda#0000
I think a decent idea would be to get you boosted to HQ 10 (because it's really cheap) and then you can just use the permits as the needs arise


[03-Aug-24 11:19 AM] avalock#0000
:o


[03-Aug-24 11:20 AM] evany.#0000
thats what i did was just from lvl 1 to lvl 8 and then 8 to like 12 or whatever (it started getting pricey)


[03-Aug-24 11:22 AM] evany.#0000
whats the trip duration between aceland and ki401d ?


[03-Aug-24 11:22 AM] evany.#0000
depending on i wouldn't mind doing the shipping i could send my 2k out there and i think sidepipe figured out thats like 1100units a trip


[03-Aug-24 11:23 AM] evany.#0000
so if its like 20 hours then i could do two trips in 4 days


[03-Aug-24 11:24 AM] avalock#0000
fair yeeeee i just was thinking would like to set up a smoother transport more in the center of antares space


[03-Aug-24 11:33 AM] tanda#0000
alright so I brain farted and ignored the actual stage you were on there, but that one's cheap as well


[03-Aug-24 11:33 AM] tanda#0000
here's the total cost for the next 6 upgrades after that

actually after your upgrades you should move it to KI-401d


[03-Aug-24 11:57 AM] tanda#0000
your ships are pretty much busy all the time, right? Let me pull a package together and get it out to Nascent, then we can do contracts


[03-Aug-24 11:57 AM] avalock#0000
yeah they mobe a lot


[03-Aug-24 11:57 AM] tanda#0000
and on that note, I should send one of my ships out to KI-401d to pick up some AR


[03-Aug-24 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
@avalock  would you like your LDE at ANT?


[03-Aug-24 12:10 PM] evany.#0000
what does it take yto relocate your hq


[03-Aug-24 12:10 PM] avalock#0000
sure!


[03-Aug-24 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
noting, it's instant


[03-Aug-24 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
but only once every 30 days


[03-Aug-24 12:11 PM] evany.#0000
couldnt i just relocate to heph and then back to whever i want it


[03-Aug-24 12:11 PM] evany.#0000
ah fine


[03-Aug-24 12:11 PM] tanda#0000
the only time it matters where your HQ is physically is when you're trying to upgrade it


[03-Aug-24 12:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It changes the bonus of what you get like Antares is electronics


[03-Aug-24 12:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So if you put it somewhere else then different bonus


[03-Aug-24 12:14 PM] tanda#0000
actually, more awake now: I have all those LFABs that are needed on ANT right now. Do you want me to just send conts?


[03-Aug-24 12:14 PM] avalock#0000
sure!!


[03-Aug-24 12:14 PM] avalock#0000
that would be awesome


[03-Aug-24 12:17 PM] tanda#0000
sent you the LFAB contracts. The remainder should be inexpensive except for POW, if you need help with cash for the rest of the upgrade let me know


[03-Aug-24 12:26 PM] avalock#0000

yeaaah i hate this some times


[04-Aug-24 11:12 AM] tanda#0000
requested termination on the 1k. I sent you the cash on that one, so I sent two seperate contracts for 500


[04-Aug-24 11:12 AM] avalock#0000
tried the 2nd one and it was only attempted


[04-Aug-24 11:12 AM] tanda#0000

@razesdark how are you doing on C right now?


[05-Aug-24 03:14 PM] razesdark#0000
I got about a week left of supplies, but I can do a trade now if you have some


[05-Aug-24 03:20 PM] tanda#0000
I do have C available, but some others were looking to buy as well


[05-Aug-24 03:21 PM] tanda#0000
if you're not looking to buy right now, I'll have another 1k in 2 days


[05-Aug-24 03:21 PM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, two days will work fine for me


[05-Aug-24 03:22 PM] razesdark#0000
How about PE? You good on that?


[05-Aug-24 03:22 PM] tanda#0000
I've got a 10 day supply right now


[05-Aug-24 03:30 PM] razesdark#0000
Alright. It takes about 2.5 days to get a weeks supply for INS bases.


[05-Aug-24 03:38 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, you definitely seem like you're making a lot more than we're consuming


[05-Aug-24 03:52 PM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, I have.
If you three with INS bases all were up and running 100%, it should consume all but a few thousands of what I produce a week, but that hasn't been the case. 
I am offloading a lot of it on the marked, whenever the price is high.


[05-Aug-24 03:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I think evayoo is still having problems with TEC on Aceland


[05-Aug-24 03:55 PM] razesdark#0000
It seems so.


[05-Aug-24 06:53 PM] avalock#0000
going to move a ship between KI401 and aceland, pickup will start being on Aceland and ANT for AR :3


[05-Aug-24 06:54 PM] tanda#0000

If y'all are going to actively upkeep a push for lower prices, I can push lower too.


[06-Aug-24 11:21 PM] pi3142718#0000
Also, if you have any 2k ships free to go from ANT to HRT or MOR, I will hire them out to ship INS around


[06-Aug-24 11:23 PM] tanda#0000

[06-Aug-24 11:24 PM] tanda#0000
another one coming online this next week or so


[07-Aug-24 05:11 AM] ratgorwesbar#0000
I will making a small delivery tmin the end of the week


[07-Aug-24 09:19 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I wouldn't say actively push it down, in like say huge price drops. Actively updating those orders, more so, will likely contribute to a downward push of prices, and it'll keep you on good terms with the market competition, in maybe not making it seem like we're all wanting to cut everyone off, from the margins. Some people could switch their production recipes, if there's too much of a margin drop, in too short a period. <- My take.


[07-Aug-24 09:20 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Trickle down economics? How about trickle down competition? lol


[07-Aug-24 10:40 AM] avalock#0000

If there's no more BUI openings.


[07-Aug-24 02:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
People can always drop more TEC BUIs, and they usually keep to the migration/education stuff, to capture as much as they can, from the distribution, but not so much, that they have less production, via their whole base #s.


[07-Aug-24 02:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's best to know the people on the planet, in that regard.


[07-Aug-24 02:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
So, every x2 POPRs, for a given planet? If it's averaging out, then people are building up.... If not, opportunity for you?


[07-Aug-24 02:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
Paris said TECs should be filled next cycle


[07-Aug-24 02:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Wildcard is for the people who don't say, just do.


[07-Aug-24 02:36 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

lmao it's gone

Yup, it's why I say, if you're boosting production of any kind, keep with the current price competition, or else someone will just get a glint in their eyes, and slurp everything at a discount.

But I would still prefer it that way. Some trading is better then no trading


[13-Aug-24 03:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
I mean, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that necessarily - carbon transport was clearly happy to sell at 320. They might even be happy it all sold at once. I‚Äôve found THF to be a really slow mover, so I‚Äôm wondering if they got stuck with a lot of stock and just wanted to liquidate it quickly


[13-Aug-24 03:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
I only make around 2k THF max a week, and even that is way more than you can sell across most CXs without dumping it into bids.


[13-Aug-24 03:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
For what it‚Äôs worth, I started making THF after carbon transport started undercutting me on DDT a few months ago üòÑ


[13-Aug-24 03:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe I need to switch to NS next so they drive that price down too üòÅ


[13-Aug-24 03:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
Diversifying is very nice. My daily production doesn't excide 50-80% of traded per day, except the products I know that I have buyers for


[13-Aug-24 03:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
I overproduce, but I don‚Äôt mind carrying inventory and selling it over time at this point - it‚Äôs just simpler for me to do single-product based than split between different products


[13-Aug-24 03:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am a new player so I have to liquidate as fast as I can to expand and keep production running üòÖ


[13-Aug-24 03:20 PM] sidepipe#0000

its counterintuitive, but "change" is right after the popr, while "open jobs" is right before

so now it's got an unemployment (/surplus) of 920-391=529 pioneers

Would it have to specifically be Nike or would I be able to set up on Aceland?

You could setup on aceland like I did

[22-Aug-24 11:45 AM] flor2081#0000
you can ping rise and check with him beforehand, not sure how many tecs you'll need


[22-Aug-24 11:47 AM] flor2081#0000
oh looks like 500 tecs, there are currently like 510 tecs unemployed so you'll get them all at once if you're lucky


[22-Aug-24 11:48 AM] flor2081#0000
though rise just started an engineer immigration program so i expect other people to also build a base


[22-Aug-24 11:53 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
The PP3 base only requires 440 techs so I'm thinking I could probably get away with it in a week or two, yeah!


[22-Aug-24 11:55 AM] flor2081#0000
i'd definitely just check with riseoffilth to be sure, he's in here too


[22-Aug-24 01:51 PM] razesdark#0000
Once all 3 existing members are at full capacity, I will struggle to supply all.
I can up production and make another base, but it might be rough for a while


[24-Aug-24 12:26 AM] pi3142718#0000

Send me a PrUN Planner of your base and let me know how much it costs. I highly recommend 9 PP3 and 2 LAB with associated HB2, HB3, and STO for an INS base. I can send the contracts tomorrow then

especially with the goal of lowering the price to 115


[24-Aug-24 02:22 AM] finestone#0000
ROI needs to weighted with a couple things in mind. 
1: Is the (CX) Market accurate? Will your production impact the market? Is there demand off market (private Cons)?
2: Profit per Permit (area) is important to consider. (ROI could be 10 days compared to 30 but If the 30 day is 10x more total profit it can be much better in the long run)(As permits get more expensive this becomes more important)
3: Shipping constraints what is the import/export demand of the base going to be? How far from the CX is it? can you do Private Cons?


[24-Aug-24 02:30 AM] laaxus#0000
but with 115/u, the profit will be like 40k
Isn't it quite low for one base ?


[24-Aug-24 02:33 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
If you recommend having labs over a pure PP3 base, I can roll with that. I'll also fit in a WEL but won't include that in the grant/loan

no joke, I generally wake up at 4am normally. On a weekend I generally don't get up before 10am


[25-Aug-24 05:52 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
4am? Yuck, for work or did you just win the genetic lottery?

ultimate plan would be dropping AR prices so low that people would see that vertical integration of argon is not profitable and tear down their AR production and when they get hooked to your cheap AR... You rise the price üòà

they're not too bad once you're used to them, just can't stockpile too much at one time for a while


[04-Sep-24 11:03 PM] tanda#0000
I generally run them 30 day blocks on resources, but something like 10 will suffice. You also won't be getting full Techs the first week of the base, so you do have time to kinda brace for the impact


[04-Sep-24 11:03 PM] tanda#0000
the CX is pretty well stocked on the resources for POP supply, so I would say your biggest problem is going to be AR

one AR base supplies something like 4-5, but the AR base will require nearly one whole dedicated ship at full capacity


[04-Sep-24 11:06 PM] tanda#0000
you do you, but be aware it's a huge shipping issue. One way travel times can be up to 24 hours, and a 2k/2k ship is only a 10% throughput increase vs a 3kt/1km3

Ask @avalock, I don't think they have many good things to say about AR shipping

I couldn't do it without LM shipping ads


[05-Sep-24 07:40 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Do we favour a certain type of INS selling here. Piecemeal or mega dump?


[05-Sep-24 10:08 AM] tanda#0000
I generally squirrel it away for internal sales, and dump when I get over about 10k


[05-Sep-24 01:14 PM] avalock#0000

How much more do you have on ANT?


[08-Sep-24 03:51 PM] avalock#0000
that was it, I got 1k more on Aceland if you want to grab that


[08-Sep-24 03:51 PM] avalock#0000
I'll do it for 180 this time


[08-Sep-24 03:57 PM] pi3142718#0000

I am interested in trading for a lot of INS if you guys take that kind of request here...


[09-Sep-24 04:59 PM] pi3142718#0000
TI, TIO, or more PE? üëÄ


[09-Sep-24 05:00 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I have 54 TI at BEN but that's all. Always down for PE trade though


[09-Sep-24 05:02 PM] pi3142718#0000
I‚Äôll take as much PE as you have on ANT/BEN for any amount of INS if you‚Äôre looking for a 1 time trade


[09-Sep-24 05:08 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah it's just a one time order for an especially big expansion plan. looking for 10-15k INS total and I can deliver PE at BEN in a few days if that works ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Where do you need the INS?


[09-Sep-24 05:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
BEN preferably but I could pick up a ship full from somewhere else if that's better for this big of a purchase. It's for bases on Biogenesis and KW-976c


[09-Sep-24 05:16 PM] pi3142718#0000
I don‚Äôt have that much excess to spare on BEN, but I‚Äôve got like 150k on ANT


[09-Sep-24 05:24 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
sounds good to me, I'll get it all from there


[09-Sep-24 07:52 PM] pi3142718#0000
Send me the contracts with our normal ratio for however much INS you want


[09-Sep-24 08:04 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you ok with still picking PE up at BEN, or you want that to ANT? If so I'll probably trade for less just to fit the PE in one ship


[09-Sep-24 08:04 PM] pi3142718#0000
I can pick up in BEN


[09-Sep-24 08:04 PM] pi3142718#0000

@sidepipe can I get a small amount of THF to get me started with my small operation on Nike? am starting a chem base but it will take a week before it shows results


[10-Sep-24 04:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
Sure! Are you starting up a project Kevin base, or doing your own thing?


[10-Sep-24 04:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
I only have, uh, 35 THF at ANT at the moment, but always making more. There's 280 out at Elon if you want to make the trip there

Do you have 40k PE?


[02-Oct-24 03:40 PM] razesdark#0000

[02-Oct-24 03:41 PM] tanda#0000
4-5 business days


[02-Oct-24 03:41 PM] razesdark#0000
Ok, cool. That'll let me bring it back on the C return trip.


[04-Oct-24 03:23 AM] razesdark#0000
When you get around to making contracts for the C and PE, set the PE price to 8 instead of 8.5.
I won't charge higher than buy prices when it is below 8.5


[04-Oct-24 03:52 AM] razesdark#0000
(actually, i made the PE contract already)

I'm going to let you pick on that, since the market is insane right now

[13-Oct-24 01:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
What's a number that would give you a good ROI on your base? I'll happily pre-pay for as much as you can sell me, and that should cover most of your expansion plans


[13-Oct-24 01:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
The OLF isn't really a for-profit venture - just want to stock up on a bunch of it so we have supply while we're still using it on Malahat, and the rest will just go hang out on the CX until someone else finds a use for it

@sidepipe do you have 1500 THF on hand?
@avalock do you have 1k AR on Aceland or ANT? Or do I need to head out to KI-401d?
@razesdark can I buy 40-60k PE?

325/u still work as a price? I haven't checked the COGM for INS in a while


[18-Oct-24 10:01 PM] tanda#0000
neither have I, but it still makes money even at CX prices


[18-Oct-24 10:12 PM] tanda#0000
hm, is DDT still so suppressed that THF even at 325/unit is better? or is it just better because THF barely has a chance to sit?


[18-Oct-24 10:13 PM] tanda#0000
I didn't even realize I regularly buy more than a week's worth of movement. If I bought off the CX I'd be a quarter of all consumption from there

[18-Oct-24 10:17 PM] tanda#0000
real question: Do I need to find an additional supplier for THF? I'm not going to be shutting out other members of the project with the second base, am I?


[18-Oct-24 10:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
shouldn't be an issue - I have capacity for up to 385 THF per day

I should have that in 3 days, maybe a little less

If you need shipping to nascent you can send me contracts for 1aic from ant to nascent. I fly there super regularly empty with 2k ships


[21-Oct-24 08:40 AM] realharvey#0000
You can also sell me any leftover C when you can't ship it off in time on nascent to prevent your storage running full

i'm also in the prosescc of increasing INS production on ACELAND


[25-Oct-24 11:33 AM] evany.#0000
gimme the base cost and i'd be willing to float it


[25-Oct-24 11:34 AM] razesdark#0000
How much of an AR base will Kevin need. Cause the logistics looks quite painful if you need to service a full AR base


[25-Oct-24 11:44 AM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Don't see how many that are running bases for KEVIN. but ' i'm using 77 AR a day. Tanda are double of me and PIBoy are 4 times bigger than Tanda. so it's just a 1000 AR used each day


[25-Oct-24 11:50 AM] tanda#0000
PiBoy has his own sources, lol


[25-Oct-24 11:50 AM] tanda#0000
If anyone is going to start a new AR base, we should go ahead and make a ship upgrade to 2k/2k part of it


[25-Oct-24 11:51 AM] evany.#0000
selfishly i only care about getting it to aceland, but yeah definitely a full base may require a 2k


[25-Oct-24 11:52 AM] ratgorwesbar#0000
maybe the other way around 1000/3000


[25-Oct-24 11:52 AM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, a 2k/2k is basically running constantly to keep up with a full Argon base


[25-Oct-24 11:52 AM] evany.#0000
ah  your right- a 1/3 is better it looks like


[25-Oct-24 11:52 AM] evany.#0000
volume hauler is even harder to justify, than a 2k/2k


[25-Oct-24 11:53 AM] razesdark#0000
I did this calculation for a full AR base.
Both ships will basically be running constantly, since ANT -> KI is about 24 hours give or take

2k/2k gives about 10% better throughput. Not much but not nothing


[25-Oct-24 12:21 PM] razesdark#0000
2k/2k is also more useful


[25-Oct-24 01:56 PM] evany.#0000
you are absolutely right. i apparently couldn't math this morning


[25-Oct-24 01:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Looks like a VCB is best tho


[25-Oct-24 02:26 PM] finestone#0000
I already have a small base on KI401d for H i could add more collectors for AR as well


[25-Oct-24 02:38 PM] tanda#0000
VCB is worst

[25-Oct-24 02:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
New base or expansion of an existing one + LCB seems like it would make the most sense

[25-Oct-24 04:44 PM] finestone#0000
Could you guys pick up the AR from KI401d or need to it shipped to ANT or somewhere else?


[25-Oct-24 04:45 PM] finestone#0000
Id be happy to setup the AR for yall if you pick it up. the reason its not built is for the export demand.


[25-Oct-24 04:46 PM] finestone#0000
if ya'll want it shipped somewhere maybe a 0% interest loan for a 2k2k would work for me.


[25-Oct-24 04:53 PM] finestone#0000
I would be happy to place 23 (AR) Rigs which would be about 300/day just let me know. Thanks


[25-Oct-24 05:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôd be okay with a loan for a ship - I don‚Äôt use the AR personally, so those with bases please let me know your preference  üôÇ


[25-Oct-24 05:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
And if 300/day will cover your needs


[25-Oct-24 08:10 PM] tanda#0000
I am willing to pick up loads at KI401d, just not every time


[25-Oct-24 09:15 PM] finestone#0000
would you buy at ANT? or you want it taken to your place? how much ar you using /day


[25-Oct-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
I'm fine with ANT or Aceland pickups. If it backs up, let me know and I will buy it and pick it up at KI-401d


[25-Oct-24 09:19 PM] tanda#0000
I know multiple other people have Aceland INS bases, I think I'm the only one using Nike?


[25-Oct-24 09:20 PM] finestone#0000
I can move it all at ANT once i get the ship. but that could be 2+ weeks so you would just need pick it up yourself between now and when i get the ship or i can just wait to build the base.


[25-Oct-24 09:24 PM] tanda#0000
that's understandable.


[25-Oct-24 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
I hope you understand that I'm not totally against going out there to get it, but it does lock down a ship for 34ish hours every time


[25-Oct-24 09:26 PM] finestone#0000
total export is 700m3/day with my H so yeah it will just be dedicated to that lane and can handle all of it.


[25-Oct-24 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
I personally burn around 300 units of AR per day between the two bases


[25-Oct-24 09:29 PM] finestone#0000
Sounds like i could personally supply TANDA then (2100AR) weekly (Sunday) buys at ANT for 140-180/u would be the plan then?


[25-Oct-24 09:31 PM] tanda#0000
information in #kevin-information is a bit out of date, how many active INS bases do we have in the project?

something like 3 weeks ago, we were blasted all the way up to 200


[27-Oct-24 12:17 PM] tanda#0000
I've personally sold something like 30k of INS through the market since then


[27-Oct-24 12:22 PM] pi3142718#0000
60k INS have been sold on ANT in the past 7 days. 110k on the other 3 markets


[27-Oct-24 12:23 PM] pi3142718#0000
I‚Äôd bet that order is filled within the week. And orders on other markets are more likely to be filled sooner because they don‚Äôt have as many local producers


[27-Oct-24 12:25 PM] pi3142718#0000
I believe that was a different order, but I could be wrong. Someone came in and bought a bunch


[28-Oct-24 05:29 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I had thought the plan was to market dump until we could agree 115?


[28-Oct-24 05:33 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000

[28-Oct-24 06:10 PM] tanda#0000
Demand is outstripping supply right now


[28-Oct-24 06:12 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Yeah ik I was just under the impression that we'd be aiming to fill bids over 115 as opposed price setting


[28-Oct-24 06:13 PM] tanda#0000
I generally don't sell to bids


[28-Oct-24 06:17 PM] tanda#0000
that's a personal rule. There's nothing stopping me from listing it at 115, but if I do that and there's enough of a gap in the market behind that, it'll just get flipped

[28-Oct-24 08:49 PM] pi3142718#0000
This is an unrealistic way to manage the price. It just results in the product getting flipped higher on other markets. To lower the price significantly you need volume on all markets, which we don‚Äôt have at that price point


[28-Oct-24 08:49 PM] pi3142718#0000
If I dumped all my INS at 115 prices would be >150 in the next week


[28-Oct-24 08:50 PM] pi3142718#0000
AMP partners will actively buy and try to flip. Just gotta fill lowstrife‚Äôs bid and they move it out of your way. Definitely saddled him with like 60k INS overall moving his bids


[28-Oct-24 08:55 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Fair enough, different approaches though because I've not been able to stock pile as I've weekly installation debts to pay


[28-Oct-24 08:58 PM] pi3142718#0000
At one point I had like 250k INS on ANT. That‚Äôs more spread out now though


[28-Oct-24 08:58 PM] tanda#0000
I don't stockpile either, I've been throwing it 1 AIC lower than PiBoy and just adding that extra buffer


[28-Oct-24 09:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Stockpiling probably isn't going to work anyways as the goal is to maintain a price, not shock it down for three days


[28-Oct-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
@pi3142718 how much production do you think would be necessary to try to reach the 115 mark?


[28-Oct-24 09:25 PM] pi3142718#0000
Hard to say. Probably at least another 50-100k per week.


[28-Oct-24 09:26 PM] pi3142718#0000
I think this is 100% the best strategy for maintaining a price. I‚Äôll occasionally move if I feel like I‚Äôm accumulating or losing more INS than I make


[28-Oct-24 09:27 PM] pi3142718#0000
So like‚Ä¶ 1.5 more kevins


[28-Oct-24 09:31 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000

Definitely down to fund a base conversion. Send me the PrUn planner and cost and I‚Äôll do 25% grant 75% zero interest loan


[28-Oct-24 09:39 PM] tanda#0000
one THF base will supply 5 more INS bases


[28-Oct-24 09:39 PM] manhim#0000
I could help with this project if you guys need. I can focus on PE on Heph + Expand, and make a Nike base for INS once the dust settle for my current expansion.


[28-Oct-24 09:41 PM] pi3142718#0000
Definitely willing to fund a base! 25% of the cost will be a grant, 75% a zero interest loan. I highly recommend a 9 PP3, 2 LAB, 2 STO base, but I know others go full PP3.


[28-Oct-24 09:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yep - you can either do that and not have to worry about imports, or I will sell you THF at 325/u


[28-Oct-24 09:42 PM] sidepipe#0000

yeah, that's why I said it's not too huge. At current market rates for both PE and INS, INS is still profitable


[10-Nov-24 10:26 PM] laaxus#0000
If you put a 8.5 bid order on the cx for pe, it doesn't get filled ?

[12-Nov-24 04:47 AM] razesdark#0000
@tanda Yeah, I could use some C tbh. I am picking up today, so within 24 hours I'll have about 110k available.


[12-Nov-24 07:04 AM] tanda#0000
Excellent, I need to buy all of that if that's okay


[12-Nov-24 05:13 PM] razesdark#0000
@evany. It will probably take about a day and a half for me to deliver the PE


[12-Nov-24 05:13 PM] evany.#0000
no rush i'm still operational for 6 days


[12-Nov-24 05:14 PM] evany.#0000
i just sent out 90 contracts to refill things as i will try to move to bulking @ 1month


[12-Nov-24 05:14 PM] evany.#0000
we will see how many get filled !

I can probably do that within 5 days.

I'm hoping to be able to take over or at least enter government on KI-401a and c (I missed the deadline for C, but we'll get them next time). I just dropped and filled a PAR on C. I'm dispatching materials to feed the COGCs for both locations


[18-Nov-24 10:22 PM] tanda#0000
hopefully inside of a month I can start growing population enough to start dropping more bases out there


[18-Nov-24 10:22 PM] tanda#0000
For anyone confused by this, PiBoy has fallen to a third of his former production.


[18-Nov-24 10:23 PM] tanda#0000
In order to get the universe as a whole back to parity, we would need another 3 fully functional bases. And the universe's demand on INS was growing at the time he pulled from production

[19-Nov-24 03:03 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I feel that there's lots of PE available and that a new base will end up selling to market more often than receiving contacts from me


[19-Nov-24 09:00 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not sure how many PE bases are currently feeding this project, but I can definitely say when these two new bases come online I will be eating more than an entire PE base's output by myself


[19-Nov-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
With the addition of another INS base probably being on the 3 month plan for me, I need to start maybe looking at running my own AR tap and THF base too, since I will consume an entire base of output at that point


[19-Nov-24 09:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
THF is LAB yeah?


[19-Nov-24 09:03 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, and it's not great margins. Super easy to run, though. AMM, H2O and NA

The daily production number considers my own usage into it.

Ok, I can go grab it, but there's only 3 warehouse units on the planet, so I'll split up the order over 3 trips.

I have 2 3k/1k, so not optimal for gasses, but they're used at around 75% capacity right now, so still some room.

[12-Dec-24 07:06 AM] tanda#0000
I believe so. Currently we should be fine on PE and AR, so we're looking at needing another THF source or more INS bases.

Hm. Even with current CX prices, according to prunplanner, INS base does not look profitable.

you may be failing to take into account internal Kevin prices. AR is 180, PE is 8.5, THF is 325 inside of the project

ahhh, it's AR. Jvaler did say that market was messed up


[12-Dec-24 07:19 AM] tanda#0000
that will eat all the profit on a bare PRUN planner. Even at 300/unit on AR and market prices on everything else, an INS base still makes around 40k/day

It requires a 2k2k to service properly. Mostly full time, too


[12-Dec-24 08:12 AM] finestone#0000
I agree with this maybe we move the #s up given inflation even 180 for AR is starting to seem low. (250+ bids at all CX's)


[12-Dec-24 09:08 AM] manhim#0000
Wait, I'm top 10?


[12-Dec-24 09:11 AM] manhim#0000
I'd be willing to plop down a THF and another INS base, but I'm getting close to maxing out my ships capacity. And the monetary gap to fill is quite big üòê . So I might be 1 or 2 months off.

I was thinking of doing something like that for a planet in IY space. Would allow me to move H at a similar rate to KI401d but at 24 hrs a round trip instead of close to 48

[15-Dec-24 11:55 AM] cptboby#0000
ah i already have a base on griffon


[15-Dec-24 11:56 AM] tanda#0000
a 2k/2k is perfect for the project. You should go through #psk-information to get the other one turned into a WCB


[15-Dec-24 11:57 AM] tanda#0000
I would recommend any decently cheap chemistry base, Elon, Griffonstone and maybe Bober are good options, though Bober is expensive


[15-Dec-24 12:02 PM] cptboby#0000
INS base is 3.2m , THF is 4.3m


[15-Dec-24 12:02 PM] cptboby#0000
with a week of supplies


[15-Dec-24 12:02 PM] laaxus#0000
I do NOT recommend to take a loan for a lab base


[15-Dec-24 12:02 PM] laaxus#0000
for a beginner that is


[15-Dec-24 12:03 PM] laaxus#0000
the roi is too low


[15-Dec-24 12:03 PM] tanda#0000
Bobzor has a Malahat base, if that's an EDC or IDC base, he's fine


[15-Dec-24 12:03 PM] laaxus#0000
true enough


[15-Dec-24 12:04 PM] cptboby#0000
IDC


[15-Dec-24 12:04 PM] laaxus#0000
do you have both of your ships upgraded ?


[15-Dec-24 12:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
The loans are 0 interest and as long as you need üòÅ


[15-Dec-24 12:04 PM] laaxus#0000
don't forget that you don't have to build the entire base at once


[15-Dec-24 12:05 PM] laaxus#0000
for example, i'm building half a LAB base on bober right now


[15-Dec-24 12:05 PM] cptboby#0000
might go half and half then


[15-Dec-24 12:05 PM] cptboby#0000
a THF and an INS


[15-Dec-24 12:06 PM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend half a pp3 now, then full pp3 then half lab


[15-Dec-24 12:06 PM] laaxus#0000
however, you do you


[15-Dec-24 12:06 PM] laaxus#0000
the pp3 is very profitable
the lab providing thf at kevin rate, less so


[15-Dec-24 12:07 PM] cptboby#0000
huh very tru üôÇ


[15-Dec-24 12:08 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, LAB payback at Kevin rates is 68 day ROI


[15-Dec-24 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah. We could consider different prices for THF


[15-Dec-24 12:09 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don‚Äôt mind 325/u because it‚Äôs my other form of support for the project, but it‚Äôll make it hard to get more THF


[15-Dec-24 12:09 PM] laaxus#0000
Maybe we could do kevin in 3 steps ?
Ins at 155, 135, 115 and adapt price for each steps ?


[15-Dec-24 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think that‚Äôs a good structure


[15-Dec-24 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
We can redistribute some of that INS wealth üòõ


[15-Dec-24 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
Like I said, I can keep selling at 325/u, but for others‚Äô bases it could be nice


[15-Dec-24 12:12 PM] laaxus#0000
For thf, I believe we should let the market decide the price


[15-Dec-24 12:13 PM] tanda#0000
I know there was some statement regarding AR as well


[15-Dec-24 12:13 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm building a lab base right now, but It was not for kevin specifically


[15-Dec-24 12:13 PM] laaxus#0000
however, I'd be happy to produce thf only, if the profit is not too far off from the most profitable recipe


[15-Dec-24 12:14 PM] laaxus#0000
(A lab base is quite expensive after all)


[15-Dec-24 12:14 PM] tanda#0000
This is the ROI at market rate for an INS base on Aceland. Profit only goes up when you control to Kevin prices

[15-Dec-24 12:15 PM] tanda#0000
I would agree, but a lot of these most profitable recipes are so market limited the profit/day isn't realistic

[15-Dec-24 12:16 PM] tanda#0000
best three competing recipes for LABs are THF, TCL, DDT


[15-Dec-24 12:16 PM] laaxus#0000
hence why I say : let the market do its things


[15-Dec-24 12:17 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm quite commited to my lab base, if the only thing that sell is thf, then I'll produce thf only, at market price


[15-Dec-24 12:20 PM] tanda#0000
Fair, perhaps just have a price ceiling in place for Kevin? We don't need project members suddenly having to pay 1k per THF because someone tried to pull out the rug again


[15-Dec-24 12:21 PM] laaxus#0000
fair

[15-Dec-24 12:40 PM] tanda#0000
Alright, so it looks like we've eaten the THF market


[15-Dec-24 12:41 PM] tanda#0000
@kevin 
Alright, community input time. What is a fair price for AR?
What is a fair ceiling for THF?
Is the price of PE at a good place?


[15-Dec-24 12:43 PM] tanda#0000
Personally I think the price of AR is too low. At 180/unit it bears no resemblance to the market at large. At the very least it needs to figure in cost of shipping as well, which at ~30k for transport from KI-401d means that it should be at least 210/unit


[15-Dec-24 12:43 PM] laaxus#0000
I believe there's enough BMP on the market that we can safely rely on them for PE


[15-Dec-24 12:43 PM] laaxus#0000
Shall we make strong enough bid, production will rise quickly


[15-Dec-24 12:44 PM] laaxus#0000
I personally always buy my pe at kevin price on the market


[15-Dec-24 12:44 PM] razesdark#0000
I'm fine with the PE price as it is now. I have two BMP bases producing PE atm.
When we set the 8.5 price, i think even bid was over 9.5


[15-Dec-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
I believe the thf ceiling should be 750/u or lower


[15-Dec-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
at current prices, 750/u is 200k or profit per day


[15-Dec-24 12:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
who else here supplies THF?


[15-Dec-24 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
me, soonTM


[15-Dec-24 12:47 PM] razesdark#0000
I buy a bit of it from @ratgorwesbar


[15-Dec-24 12:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm personally fine with staying at 325/u, but I think we should cap it around 750-1k


[15-Dec-24 12:49 PM] laaxus#0000
cap to 750 seems fine


[15-Dec-24 12:51 PM] tanda#0000

With all of those price limits in effect, INS still makes a good chunk of money for the base currently


[15-Dec-24 12:52 PM] laaxus#0000
that seems an healthy start


[15-Dec-24 12:53 PM] tanda#0000
@finestone What do you think of an increase to at least 210/unit for AR?


[15-Dec-24 12:58 PM] finestone#0000
Sounds good!


[15-Dec-24 12:59 PM] tanda#0000
Do you need higher? I know it costs a lot to operate out in KI


[15-Dec-24 12:59 PM] evany.#0000
is this supposed to be representative of a base running ins w/those prices ?

yes, it is

[15-Dec-24 01:01 PM] finestone#0000
Yes that is fine. There just alot of bids at 250-350 at this point so 180 was seeming to be a steep discount. 210 feels much better üôÇ

If your ship is still there, I have 560 at Elon atm

plenty of them, yes


[20-Dec-24 07:16 PM] evov#0000
I've been shipping PE from the other CX's back to the motherland of ANT. I think I've got about a mil stocked there. ( with a similar amount at MOR still waiting to be transported ) so hopefully the CX running dry like it is in BEN won't be a realistic risk here.


[20-Dec-24 07:16 PM] tanda#0000
hopefully we see a spike of newer players being able to do PE as well


[20-Dec-24 07:20 PM] razesdark#0000
I was quite high on the PE leaderboards when kevin was formed. Prices was quite high back then.
I think it attracted a fair few players cause I fell quite a way down the list at some point and the price went down to around 9.
I'm now back at 2nd place, when my second base gets all its workers, I might be producing comparable numbers to CptColeslaw, which is in 1st position.


[20-Dec-24 07:21 PM] razesdark#0000
I have a hunch that some players left the PE market when the price dropped


[20-Dec-24 07:32 PM] tanda#0000
most likely!


[21-Dec-24 03:50 AM] cptboby#0000
im looking for 1500AR preferably on Aceland, but can be ANT @tanda , @finestone

What is the plan for the INS price is there a new lowest price or is it sell to whatever??


[21-Dec-24 12:33 PM] tanda#0000
sell at whatever sells, honestly. 
I would love to get INS down to 115, but if you run `CXM INS` You'll be able to see we're already like 20/unit below the other markets


[21-Dec-24 12:34 PM] tanda#0000
if we try to force down the price arbitrarily, people will start buying it up and shipping it out to other CXs


[21-Dec-24 12:35 PM] tanda#0000
without this project the universe would be missing a huge chunk of INS supply, that's for sure


[21-Dec-24 12:43 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Yeah i have seen we are the top producers of INS. I was trying to take second place from you Tanda. But i have admitted defeat üòã 
AmpPartners is buying everything below 130 , dunno who they are. So i'm selling at 140 whenever i have something to sell


[21-Dec-24 12:44 PM] tanda#0000
Amp Partners and Interstellar Gaia are the "Market Makers" for this region


[21-Dec-24 12:45 PM] tanda#0000
so that's just a "floor price" that they've set


[21-Dec-24 12:45 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
They set the lowest bar and resells higher?


[21-Dec-24 12:46 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
I know interstellar Gaia does this


[21-Dec-24 12:47 PM] tanda#0000
Pretty much? but I don't see them selling a lot here


[21-Dec-24 12:47 PM] tanda#0000
they may move the product to places like BEN which have far fewer suppliers


[21-Dec-24 12:51 PM] tanda#0000
I don't think I'll do more than one more INS base, btw. I'm already straining the project's supply, so I'll need to stay at a point I can mostly self supply soon.


[21-Dec-24 12:54 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
I'm doing the same..almost top THF


[21-Dec-24 12:54 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
The only thing i dont want to self supply is AR


[21-Dec-24 12:54 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Because of the shipping


[21-Dec-24 12:55 PM] tanda#0000
I bought another 2k/2k just for that base and it's still a lot


[21-Dec-24 12:56 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
For the AR??


[21-Dec-24 12:56 PM] tanda#0000
Yes. We definitely needed the extra production, after the CX started spiking


[21-Dec-24 12:59 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Pretty high cost to build out, when you need the extra ship for it


[21-Dec-24 01:01 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, it's a lot. And the base is already expensive, what with needing AEF and INS


[21-Dec-24 01:30 PM] razesdark#0000
Can't wait for the larger cargoholds that are coming with the gateways


[21-Dec-24 01:31 PM] tanda#0000
I'm cautiously optimistic. They're going to be hella expensive for a while, and I bet they're going to be hecka slow


[21-Dec-24 01:33 PM] razesdark#0000
For sure. I'm fine with that if it would mean less trips weekly to some of the bases that require attention on a 3-4 day interval today.


[22-Dec-24 12:46 PM] tanda#0000
How is everyone doing for THF? I need to buy some more, but it's like shoveling it down an endless hole over here. Buy it before I can!

wainting for pops


[23-Dec-24 02:06 PM] tanda#0000
I should be net positive on THF in two weeks, but POP +buffer takes time


[23-Dec-24 09:30 PM] tanda#0000
Alright I gave 2 days of warning. @sidepipe how much THF do you have available at ANT or Elon?


[23-Dec-24 10:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
None atm - I think you gave too much warning üòÖ

are you limited by shipping capacity?


[24-Dec-24 07:32 AM] tanda#0000
there wasn't any THF I wanted to buy at that pricepoint, but Santa stopped by early with some 500/unit THF on the CX


[24-Dec-24 07:32 AM] tanda#0000
I should be able to self supply from this point


[24-Dec-24 07:33 AM] realharvey#0000
I cant help with a supply shortage :D but If you'd be in a logistical shortage I could have helped


[24-Dec-24 07:34 AM] tanda#0000

[24-Dec-24 01:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll be switching griff over to 100% THF as well once this whole FLX situation calms down

probably similar numbers right now

Accepting preorders :ssun:


[30-Dec-24 12:05 PM] tanda#0000
If it builds up I'll buy you out. Never fear


[30-Dec-24 12:06 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
You just take private sale contracts at 8.5/unit (from #kevin-information) or some other price?


[30-Dec-24 12:15 PM] tanda#0000
Almost all the PE I purchase goes to Kevin production, so I try my best to stick to 8.5/unit or trading with Coleslaw


[30-Dec-24 12:16 PM] tanda#0000
If supplies ran short I would buy at whatever price point to keep production going


[30-Dec-24 12:16 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd like to buy all of that


[30-Dec-24 12:17 PM] roche3950#0000
Okay. The ship is slow burning to Heph now because I‚Äôm at work. I‚Äôll let you know the final amount loaded and we can firm commit to the trade then

[30-Dec-24 12:24 PM] moke.#0000
I have 170k PE at ANT ready now as well, actually.


[30-Dec-24 12:27 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'm still just spinning up from my grant, so my quantities tend to be small, but, 8.5 is over the bid right now, so I'm reasonably happy to feed at least some of it directly to one of you.  ( @tanda you aren't on the list in the other channel for selling PE, that's why I was confused)


[30-Dec-24 12:28 PM] tanda#0000
I don't sell PE, lol


[30-Dec-24 12:29 PM] tanda#0000
I buy tons of it


[30-Dec-24 12:29 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Oh, maybe I'm misreading the post then, I thought the PE buyers were _below_ the line where it says "PE to be picked up at ANT for..."


[30-Dec-24 12:30 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah, this is what is happening, looking at the base plans for each group


[30-Dec-24 03:15 PM] cptboby#0000
When do i become a true member? been making INS for 2 weeks now üôÇ

im not on the list tho


[30-Dec-24 03:42 PM] tanda#0000
I'll get you added when I'm back at my pc


[30-Dec-24 04:14 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
General idea is I set up a contract to you with the PE, a cost of 8.5 x # units, and fulfill the material delivery?  (or is the normal thing to wait for payment first?).

Just 6000 or so in this upcoming batch.


[30-Dec-24 06:14 PM] roche3950#0000
@laaxus Final qty is 44,000 arriving in 2.5h from this message
Firm order?


[30-Dec-24 07:24 PM] tanda#0000
Pretty much, though if possible I would prefer to buy in very large lots at one time. I go through a lot of contracts these days

{Reactions}

[30-Dec-24 07:37 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Makes sense I'll see about selling on the cx until I can scale a bit more


[30-Dec-24 07:37 PM] tanda#0000
When I say in large lots, I mean like 40-50k upwards


[30-Dec-24 07:38 PM] roche3950#0000
If you're running a full BMP base you should be kicking out ~20k a day


[30-Dec-24 07:38 PM] tanda#0000
I barely make PE out of Heph (probably the equivalent of 4 BMPs) and I could meet that minimum in 5 days


[30-Dec-24 07:45 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Yeah that's about how long it would take me to get 40k-50k but in the meantime it means im just idling a large chunk of my assets.  (Part of the problem is that my experts aren't built up yet but they are coming).


[30-Dec-24 07:45 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
So I need to finish the scale up


[30-Dec-24 07:46 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Plus heph is out of pioneers for me in the reserve until the next population cycle


[31-Dec-24 01:14 AM] laaxus#0000

buyer is a very low tier (#31) producer of INS


[31-Dec-24 10:38 PM] tanda#0000
so it's interesting they just bought 40k of it


[01-Jan-25 01:45 AM] pi3142718#0000
130 isn‚Äôt an unreasonable price with the current amount of INS produced


[01-Jan-25 05:17 AM] laaxus#0000
Ideally, I'd like to buy 600 AR at aceland
if I can't then I guess I'd like to buy as much AR as I can @ ANT


[01-Jan-25 12:43 PM] tanda#0000
I can fill that easily @ Aceland. Send me a contract when you get a chance


[01-Jan-25 12:55 PM] laaxus#0000
what price per u ?


[01-Jan-25 12:58 PM] tanda#0000
Kevin internal price of 210/unit


[01-Jan-25 01:04 PM] laaxus#0000
thanks !


[01-Jan-25 01:04 PM] tanda#0000
No problem!


[01-Jan-25 01:05 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, and our goal is actually 115, but we do need to address the price discrepancies between the CXs before we can drive it down that far


[01-Jan-25 01:05 PM] tanda#0000
I'm just commenting that we just go "reset" back up to 140 by this guy buying 40k in one go


[01-Jan-25 01:52 PM] pi3142718#0000
Since I think you‚Äôve replaced my production at this point, I‚Äôd say you need to ~100k more INS per week to reach those prices, as a rough guess


[01-Jan-25 01:52 PM] pi3142718#0000
Since yeah, you need to meet demand on all 4 CXs


[01-Jan-25 01:59 PM] tanda#0000
so roughly 10 more PP3 bases. that means 2 more AR taps, and 2 more THF bases, and about 3 bases of PE


[01-Jan-25 03:15 PM] manhim#0000
I've got 82519 PE available at ANT if anyone needs


[01-Jan-25 04:31 PM] cptboby#0000

[01-Jan-25 06:45 PM] pi3142718#0000

I don't think a lot of people here have the capacity to send a ship out for ~4 days to make 10 credits more a unit


[03-Jan-25 01:19 PM] getonthetrain#0000
just based on what some share about base days in supply


[03-Jan-25 02:26 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
just thought about hose who sit and buy up large qantums, would ship them to another CX


[03-Jan-25 09:23 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
TRU is on the money here. That responsibility is being outsourced mainly to AMP Partners, I think


[03-Jan-25 09:24 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
@pi3142718 I still have a couple of pending contracts for the scraps on Aceland, if you're trying to get rid of them


[03-Jan-25 09:25 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Also, If you have any spare friend PRO codes, I'll happily buy them off you


[03-Jan-25 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
I've definitely been giving thought to sending INS to other stations as well. Mostly thinking about sending it by shipping contract


[03-Jan-25 09:26 PM] tanda#0000
30k gets you transport one CX away. On a full load of 20k INS that's only a cost increase of 1.5/unit


[03-Jan-25 09:36 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
+ foreign exchange fees and conversion


[03-Jan-25 09:51 PM] pi3142718#0000

[08-Jan-25 01:38 PM] laaxus#0000
just send me a cont @ ANT with the decided amount


[08-Jan-25 03:11 PM] razesdark#0000
I have about 310k of PE available at ANT now


[08-Jan-25 03:26 PM] tanda#0000
Sorry, it's listed next to the base list at 210/unit. I'll put in a quick price reference at the top


[08-Jan-25 03:28 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah that's what i mean, did we not rise ar price from 210 ?


[08-Jan-25 03:58 PM] finestone#0000
WE raised to 210 from 180


[08-Jan-25 05:00 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, it was at 180 before


[08-Jan-25 06:00 PM] roche3950#0000

can also have you as a permanent buyer


[08-Jan-25 06:00 PM] roche3950#0000
i.e., I‚Äôd post here, check for other cares, if nothing just put up to you

if works ?


[08-Jan-25 11:52 PM] roche3950#0000
68k is up to you to accept at your convenience


[09-Jan-25 06:06 AM] tanda#0000
I forgot to add (but just threw it on the baselist): I now make THF, if sidepipe is tapped, HMU


[10-Jan-25 03:36 PM] laaxus#0000
hey @tanda how much AR can I buy from you ?


[10-Jan-25 03:36 PM] laaxus#0000

please send at 5 days will deliver in order recieved


[11-Jan-25 12:31 PM] tanda#0000
Small note: I would prefer if everyone reached out to other sources for THF/AR before buying off me. I can afford to bank/transport these materials a lot better than some (and I use a lot of my production).


[11-Jan-25 12:35 PM] tanda#0000
Completely separate from that statement: I need to buy 200k PE again. Anyone have it on hand?

[16-Jan-25 03:24 AM] realharvey#0000
There is no too much PE


[16-Jan-25 04:23 AM] razesdark#0000
O is too heavy. Its been going up in price a lot lately so i decided to look into making a base that extracts it.
I would need 2M for a base, and 49M for ships to maintain it


[16-Jan-25 05:31 AM] evov#0000
I would be very very surprised if it required 8 ships to maintain a single base producing O.


[16-Jan-25 05:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm pretty sure one or two (max) LCB should be enough ?


[16-Jan-25 05:32 AM] razesdark#0000
I guess I miscalculated a bit on the ships.
I would have to export a full 2k/2k everu 0.97 days


[16-Jan-25 05:34 AM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, my mistake.
Its only a 1.5 day ish back and forth, so guess you could get away with 3-4 ships instead of 7

probably be an interesting choice for, say.... your RAT plan? h2o > hyf


[28-Jan-25 10:56 PM] tanda#0000
given the distances in the system, 2k/2k functions pretty fine, but a 5k/5k would probably do as well-ish

I'll definitely look at that later, though


[28-Jan-25 10:57 PM] tanda#0000
I did back off on that a bit, though. Multiple independent RAT production lines going up in Thalassa, I want to see how that sorts stuff out for a sec


[31-Jan-25 07:35 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I set up COF prod line over Thalassa A, B & C and highly rate it. 1x 2k/2k STL ship in system and other than that, NS shipments in are stable with COF & CAF shipments out

Requesting increase AR price to 230.


[24-Feb-25 08:31 AM] realharvey#0000
what is your reasoning for it?  I am not part of this project, But I looked at the revenue rates for each MAT, and AR is not the one I would adjust personally


[24-Feb-25 08:32 AM] realharvey#0000
with inputs from CX THF makes 47K/D, PE 51K/D and AR 69K/D while having the lowest maintenance cost. (Less capital caught up in Inputs/Consumablles)


[24-Feb-25 12:04 PM] finestone#0000
Because shipping is hard and market has a lot of bids at 250+ that I don't get to fill cuz I sell all to Kevin OP


[24-Feb-25 12:07 PM] finestone#0000
I just need to buy another ship :snibbob:


[24-Feb-25 12:11 PM] finestone#0000
I am happy with the project! Just making a request.Maybe THF should also get a bump idk though I don't make it. Also is it easier to ship? What if inputs are not purchased from cx? What is the income for INS producers with these input costs. I think game has had some inflation since project was started.


[25-Feb-25 06:53 AM] tanda#0000
COGM for INS with current costs + updated AR cost:

[25-Feb-25 06:58 AM] tanda#0000
@finestone does bring up a valid point with the shipping cost of this base. Everytime I turn around I'm having to send another LCB to go get another load.
Flight times to/from KI-401d average around 20-24 hours, meaning you basically have one LCB constantly dedicated to it. Assuming that you bought one of EVoV's LCBshttps://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1277039198892986489/1340143268977185032, that puts your cost of shipping around 29k per day (6.2mil ship cost, roughly 84% of ship time dedicated to this base, spread across 180 days)


[25-Feb-25 07:01 AM] tanda#0000
THF is in a fine spot at 325/unit, shipping there is of no real consequence and the inputs are pretty cheap (one of them is literally garbage).


[25-Feb-25 07:08 AM] tanda#0000
That said, we bumped AR not long ago and the market really hasn't changed much since then. What does everyone else think?


[25-Feb-25 07:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don‚Äôt buy AR, so it‚Äôs really up to the INS makers, but it seems reasonable to me üòÑ


[25-Feb-25 07:47 AM] finestone#0000
We could also really use a 3rd AR producer I think ü§î


[25-Feb-25 07:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
Ideally, it‚Äôd be nice if we could roughly keep the profits of each base in the project equal (though I don‚Äôt mind the current THF price because it‚Äôs so cheap to make anyway)

I am pretty well tapped for the moment, I'm afraid. I can get you one load in like 48 hours, and another about 48 hours after that. But I have no bulk currently available


[15-Apr-25 09:22 PM] manhim#0000
How much time do you think it'll take? I should be good for a week or two, but I might need more by that point to keep my buffer.


[15-Apr-25 09:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
not long - a full LAB base can make ~380 a day, I've just been focusing on 100% DDT recently


[15-Apr-25 09:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll request term and send you a new contract for the same amount if I don't have it in 3 days

@manhim @timomurbekov I've voted NO on the TEC IMM right now, and put in a FES3 motion instead. If we run that FES3 it gets us 1500TEC vs 150 for TEC Immigration. Please vote yes on the FES3 and no on the other

Sounds good was just giving you the heads up


[30-Apr-25 07:54 PM] jab.sh#0000
so does the "you only get x people" (isn't this like you only get 10% unemployed) only apply to new bases, and there's no upper limit to the popr cycle if you already have a base?


[30-Apr-25 07:55 PM] tanda#0000
correct, that's why people recommend always dropping right before POPR. otherwise the maximum is you can only get 10% of current unemployed pop on the planet. In this case, with 419 free TEC, that means a max of 42.


[30-Apr-25 07:56 PM] tanda#0000
In the case of large pop shortfall, pops are assigned roundrobin style (citation needed) to all bases currently on the planet, meaning that everyone should wind up missing POP if there is large enough of a shortfaill.


[30-Apr-25 07:59 PM] jab.sh#0000
ok cool, guess I understood more than I thought üòÜ


[30-Apr-25 08:00 PM] jab.sh#0000
so if there's 10 bases and 100 missing pop then each base will lose 10 pop


[30-Apr-25 08:00 PM] jab.sh#0000
interesting


[30-Apr-25 08:03 PM] jcheung#0000
uhm


[30-Apr-25 08:03 PM] jcheung#0000
i thought it was disproportionately taken from bases that needed more of them


[30-Apr-25 08:03 PM] jcheung#0000
wonder where i got that idea


[30-Apr-25 08:03 PM] tanda#0000
I've seen some things regarding that myself, but I've seen few to no hard evidence to back it up


[30-Apr-25 08:04 PM] tanda#0000
so maybe it is that way, maybe it isn't


[30-Apr-25 08:04 PM] tanda#0000
If it's done round robin style, that would work out that way, though


[30-Apr-25 08:04 PM] jcheung#0000
i *feel* like i've seen some pop shortages but mine were still max while people were complaining, but i also am not entirely sure i didn't hallucinate it


[30-Apr-25 08:05 PM] tanda#0000
it would distribute it to every base equally until the bases with lesser pop requirements were full, then keep going with the rest of the bases until it ran out of pop


[30-Apr-25 08:05 PM] jcheung#0000
ah yes


[30-Apr-25 08:05 PM] jab.sh#0000
could've been that they were talking about new bases


[30-Apr-25 08:05 PM] jcheung#0000
sorry my allergy infused brain didn't pick up that you said round robin

so using this as an example, if there were exactly 10 bases with exactly 1000 pop needed each, each gets 990...
but if it was 9 bases that need 900 each, and one base that needed 1100, then the one base that needed 1100 is stuck at 1000/1100


[30-Apr-25 08:07 PM] jcheung#0000
i think


[30-Apr-25 08:14 PM] jab.sh#0000
my example was for when all bases are full and you lose pop


[30-Apr-25 08:15 PM] jab.sh#0000
but I get what you're saying


[30-Apr-25 08:56 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, so was mine


[30-Apr-25 08:56 PM] jcheung#0000
the base with 1100 demand could have been first


[30-Apr-25 10:33 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Looking for approx 1000 AR on Aceland and 2000 on ANT.
Is there a queue right now?


[30-Apr-25 10:34 PM] jab.sh#0000
how urgent?


[30-Apr-25 10:35 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
7 days-ish ahead of production shut down so not madly

[30-Apr-25 10:35 PM] jab.sh#0000
I've got 2k AR on Aceland which is 111 days for me, but next popr that should change, but someone (finest one or Tanda) should have more available sooner


[30-Apr-25 10:36 PM] jab.sh#0000
speaking of @tanda can you update #kevin-information? üôÇ


[30-Apr-25 10:36 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
@finestone are you struggling to get all AR output shipped?


[30-Apr-25 10:37 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
If so I'd be willing to do a 50% loan at no interest for a new ship, if it helps


[30-Apr-25 10:37 PM] tanda#0000
I'm currently about two loads behind for my own self, but should be able to start providing in roughly 72 hours


[30-Apr-25 10:37 PM] tanda#0000
I think Fin had a lot already extracted, though


[30-Apr-25 10:38 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Sounds like theirs might almost have reached ant, from their prior message. So I'll pre-emptively sent a cont to them


[30-Apr-25 10:39 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
Which just leaves 1000 at Ace... if Fin can fill the ANT conts


[30-Apr-25 10:40 PM] tanda#0000
you could definitely buy 1k off of Jab, that AR will last a long time even with full pop


[30-Apr-25 10:41 PM] jab.sh#0000
I forget what my burn is at full pop


[30-Apr-25 10:41 PM] jab.sh#0000
I think 1k lasts 20d?


[30-Apr-25 10:43 PM] tanda#0000
it'll last you slightly longer due to no experts, but a base at full burn consumes 70.37 per day

[30-Apr-25 10:43 PM] tanda#0000
so about 2 weeks for 1k AR


[30-Apr-25 11:26 PM] finestone#0000
Nahh im good just have had my ships doing other things
