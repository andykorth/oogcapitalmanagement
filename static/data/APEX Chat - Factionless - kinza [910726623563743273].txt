**kerfy**:	yehaww


[22-Nov-21 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	CAF production has started.... Only the pioneer efficency is 48 % and settlers just 18% due to lack of workforce. Anyhow. I am going to sell COF for a starting price of 250/unit. I will post a few sell as soon as I can (5 or 10 units each).


[22-Nov-21 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Made some calculations with Acexephon. Scaling the production capacity to 100 % would drop the efficiency down to 18 % (from roughly 30 % now) pfffffff


[23-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Thx for the first COF sale!


[23-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	2 Beans here take approx. 18h, while on another base its only 4,5 h


[23-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	so still room for efficency


[23-Nov-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	hopefully the pop update will give you more workers


[23-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	We all should be in a similiar dilemma. But last two reports it was +1k workforce. So I think we will get more momentum. Maybe we can habe 15k or 20k population until the end of the contest.


[23-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	However I will add two more Foodprocessors, a chemical plant and a glass factory in about 24+h. Providing like 100 open positions for settlers and about 200/300 for pioneers.


[23-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And in a few weeks I will add a technician only building, as I would like to see them here


[23-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah it would be good to get those going


[23-Nov-21 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'm going to drop two more BMPs, so that'll be 200 more pios needed


[23-Nov-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	ü•Å more pio = more demand for Cof (at least for companies with none greedy FCOs)


[23-Nov-21 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	sitting on a ton of O if you guys needed it


[23-Nov-21 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	the COF brought me up to 97% efficiancy .. 869/1000 pio's


[23-Nov-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-21 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-21 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Will see by tomorrow if the production time will decrease from 17d 7h (or 1 months 2days) a bit...


[24-Nov-21 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Dec-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	we are working on getting some ALO or AL out here and then I will make some, but no production yet


[12-Dec-21 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I read, that PWO is available ?


[12-Dec-21 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	I may have over sold it slightly, we have PWO stocked and we're close to having production. Working on that now


[13-Dec-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	any one want some AR ??


[13-Dec-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Maybe but not in Kinza :-)


[13-Dec-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	i got 60 there..


[15-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	O = 50/u


[15-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	C=250/u


[16-Dec-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	ok on the oc prices .. :)


[23-Dec-21 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Ah great - I have all workforce now. Seems I employ 240 of the 324 settlers on Kinza. Also I realized that the Inf will start working now. The next 60 TUB will be ready in 4 days - so before the next consumption


[23-Dec-21 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	so looks like 100 TUB every 10 days?


[23-Dec-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	consumption, yes.


[23-Dec-21 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	By the way: If there is a way I would like to do the first term of Governor of Kinza, once the ADM is build. I dont care about the following terms (could do them as well) but if possible I would like to be the first. Was the first one elected ? Or choosen automaticaly ?


[23-Dec-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	I don‚Äôt see any problem with that. @MadMonk was looking to be the governor long term at Kinza but getting you the first term shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I believe it is an election.


[23-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	I 100 support that!!!


[23-Dec-21 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Great!! It would just close the cycle a bit. Naming the system and the planet, settling it, develope it with other great companies and just be sthg. like the opening president.


[23-Dec-21 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Yeah I feel ya. It completes the journey. You‚Äôve got GTU‚Äôs support. You‚Äôve been a great partner working with us on developing this whole region.


[23-Dec-21 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	hell as long as you are not a jerk, you can be GOV as long as you want for all I care


[24-Dec-21 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	@All - As most of you are probably celebrating Christmas or at least in the tradition of Christmas and for the good of the contest I am giving out Coffee packages as gifts. I will add 5 packages with 2 COF to the LM for free. Be fair and just take one add. For the others. I will give out 5 to 10 more packages. To get one, pls do a BUY add to the LM, if possible with a rating <> "P" so its easier to see for me. I will check in during the next 24h and see who I can make a present.


[24-Dec-21 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Update: the LM did not eat 0 as a price. So you have to pay a "transaction fee" of 0.01 NCC for it.


[24-Dec-21 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Thanks Aufricer! Merry Christmas to you too


[24-Dec-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	thank ya! Merry Christmas!


[24-Dec-21 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	Meery Xmas... here to mud in yer eye .. :)


[29-Dec-21 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Technician demand is 50 now. Lets see if we get some of them with the next pop update. Also the TUB will be ready in 14h (had run out of EXO again so it took longer)

[04-Jan-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jan-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will post already a few more adds but the stuff (the requested HSE) and small tech consumables will be there only in about 11/12h. They should auto fullfill once they are delivered


[04-Jan-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For the COF adds, feel free to post own BUY adds. I dont mind the currency (except AIC, only in emergency)


[05-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	if anyone wants a stock up of OVE, go ahead and post here in the next few days. When my ship arrives I am going to offload my excess stock back to the CX to sell

[10-Jan-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Hopefully we'll swing enough to cover everyone's open job slots.

[12-Jan-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jan-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Looks like orders are now being charged a fee in CIS?


[12-Jan-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I was just noticing that too


[12-Jan-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	think it's probably a glitch in the game


[12-Jan-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	oh I bet it's because Aufricer was just elected


[12-Jan-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
***MadMonk21** deleted this message.*


[12-Jan-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**kerfy**:	-Prime lending rates go nutz .. run on the Banks ..


[12-Jan-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Dear all - thank you for the votes. As the opening governor I promissed tax/fee of "0". We also said, that the currency to be used should be "NCC". It seems that the game dont allow the settings they promissed in the documentation. Currently as the fee collecting entity I only have the choice between CIS Faction and my CORP. I cant change the currency. I indeed put all taxes down to "0". Unfortunately the warehouse fees have a minimum of 50 per week.  I have adressed those issues in the official discords and hope, that the devs of the game will have a look towards and maybe change the settings. Also have I  asked if the next governor will be able t set the currency to non CIS. Due to the autoset of taxes and collecting entity to CIS directly with the election all taxes paid are lost and no human will collect them. But the good thing is we have developed the planet and region very well. I expect the 10k population by tomorrow. To celebrate that and the election I invite everybody


[12-Jan-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	- also the companies without a seat on Kinza (e.g. those that settled the contributing planets or Nove) - to a Coffee party. Feel free to put a buy add to the LM of Kinza for 10 COF each. we should not be more then 20 companies, right ? SO I limit it to 200 COF in total. Put the add with a delivery of 3 or 4 days and you will be served. Also I will start producing a few more TUB for the upkeep of the infrastructure. That said I remind kerfy of his 100k donation promiss to help with the upkeep of our infrastructure. I will detail here about the income of warehouse fees and anything else that would be of interesst. But for now - lets be proud of what we reached.


[12-Jan-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	whatever you need, we got you...


[12-Jan-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jan-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	:)


[16-Jan-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Hi everybody! I will go on and produce a few more TUB for the upkeep. I also realized, that we will need Stretchers and "OFF" during the next 30 days of upkeep. Should we coordinate the CogC somehow or just see what people vote for (I am fine with almost all reasonable programs e.g. settlers, farming or even technicians :-) ).


[16-Jan-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also as a note. I don't like the public price for LAB products. So I will probably construct my own (in the core) mainly to make NR for the AFABs that I/we will need here or even the THF later...


[16-Jan-22 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You can ping me or discuss that in discord (will read it once I am back,.maybe next weekend). To see if it is reasonable to coordinate somehow.


[16-Jan-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I can cover the STR, and I think we still have some OFF stock out this way that we brought out


[16-Jan-22 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	We'll need to make some planning on how and which areas to expand into first. Might be best to do on the discord.


[16-Jan-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	TRU up onthe LM if you need it, I have about 100 now on Kinza


[17-Jan-22 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	i have 740 MG .. whats the price to sell it at ?


[17-Jan-22 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I've been doing 12/u


[17-Jan-22 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	10/u


[17-Jan-22 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	look at the tracker


[17-Jan-22 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JasonWazza**:	MG is 12/u MCG is 10/u


[18-Jan-22 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**McGangsta**:	ahh shit, misread


[18-Jan-22 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	That's a 2 month+ supply for the PG heh


[19-Jan-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	CoGC needs 8 more MCG upkeep. I donated the remaining


[19-Jan-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I have a ship on my way (approx 72h). I can do one or two runs to LG-913 then


[19-Jan-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	And 1 free HSE is with me. (10 more are producing in the core that moment).


[19-Jan-22 10:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	produced... they dont work for me


[19-Jan-22 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I covered the last MCG with some spares I had


[19-Jan-22 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	10 STR ready in 4 hours that I'll donate


[19-Jan-22 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	do you have some TUB you can provide?


[19-Jan-22 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Jan-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Despite the fact I just bought Carbon that I wont need (disadvantage of smart phones in non smart hands) I started the SHIPYARD project by donating the Truss.


[19-Jan-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Where is that located so I can take a peek/contribute?


[19-Jan-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	PPS LG-418b

**Aufricer**:	In the planet window, the last planetary project.


[19-Jan-22 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	My personal next step is to slowly start producing AFABS. By the time the shipyard might be fi ished I also should have most parts for a glass ship available. Not sure if one is needed in our system


[19-Jan-22 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	If we are going to develop this area, it may be useful


[20-Jan-22 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Due to the " Miss Clicks". Is there interesst in adds in curremcy other than NCC ? If not I wont put more of them.

**Aufricer**:	Who wanted the Sulfur ? I brought it as well as a small quantity of Silicon. Also 1 HSE is on the LM for pickup


[24-Jan-22 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	I did buy the Sulfur and SIO, I'm going to make SEA in between the PE production, for when someone wants to settle SEA planets


[24-Jan-22 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Feb-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	aw, right. I forgot about that, sorry!


[03-Feb-22 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Someone else made a tech building ?


[03-Feb-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	no idea. How many techs do you need?


[03-Feb-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	We're good on settlers, so, maybe time to use more settlers, or let them evolve to techs?


[04-Feb-22 12:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kerfy**:	posted some DW sells in various currencies.. seperated by the A,B,or C ,or P ratings.. If you grab the wrong one .. ping me i'll fix yah up..


[04-Feb-22 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	There is more open jobs left as I have places. So I asked if someone made a building, that requires techs.


[04-Feb-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Feb-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	Figure I'll post here as well since not everyone is on Discord as regularly, but I was wondering about a Wildlife Park here to increase comfort which is needed for TEC growth and higher tiers. What are people's opinions on building and supporting one of these with the understanding that it would take higher taxes and fees or private donations to get it up and running


[07-Feb-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and either would need to bring in some parts and materials from CX areas to support it or settle other bases and infrastructure here to be able to make the stuff out this way


[07-Feb-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	Main things would be CHP and source of CLI, BRM to make the SOI needed, and then making HABs, which would be a UPF and needs bfabs and the SOI to make


[10-Feb-22 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jul-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	For NS I temp. added a 4th CHPand productivity is back from 58 % to more. So I may fullfill one of the bigger adds later

[17-Aug-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Aug-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gravy**:	Can't help but notice our employeed pioneer population is dropping and we are no longer run AG for COGC.  Have we lost farmers or people just pivoting


[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Most players shut down their bases. Thus nobody is voting/providing input for the infrastructure. I would say 2 or 3 players remained. I am not willing to maintain tech or engineer popi. So I will wait the decline in general population and


[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Switch to pioneers/settlers only


[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Honestly, I came all the way out here to run FRMs.  Without the COGC, I'm better off winding down this base and going some where else myself.


[22-Dec-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gravy**:	Voting works, obviously while being fertile, that is not what the collective group wants to persue


[22-Dec-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cherrybark**:	Going out of business ads up on LM


[22-Dec-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You may have the COCG. From time to time I would like to see it food. Believe it or not Indont have a farm here at the moment

**worvand**:	hello kinza


[04-Apr-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Welcome!


[04-Apr-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	where you want these extra building mats i got, or should i just drop them in the warehouse


[04-Apr-24 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Honestly, I'm not sure.  As of our last "POPR LG-418b" we are at 100% needs fulfillment for the first 4 needs.  We have plenty of infrastructure buildings for the foreseeable future (if you check POPI you can see we are only using 2/4 SS, 1/3 Inf, and 1/2 Wildlife parks). I'm pretty sure we have enough infrastructure buildings for like 2 - 3 x as many PIO/SETs as now.


[04-Apr-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	I wouldn't mind a bit more warehouse space on the planet, but I think we need to go through 2 levels of upgrades to get 1 more rental unit/person


[04-Apr-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	also we need more pio, im 352/1050 rn


[04-Apr-24 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Isn't there a max fill/week? I suspect because the POPR just turned over like 21 hours ago you'll have to wait like 6 days to fill up. I ran another pio immigration program so we should be set.


[04-Apr-24 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	We still have 14.3% unemployment before the new program, so that's like 1200 PIO unemployed.  I think that whole workforce reserve pool is what gets us, but I'm not sure how to change that setting.


[04-Apr-24 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	ok, my luck building my base just after the popr XD


[04-Apr-24 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	we just need 29 more TRU for this level of warehouse


[04-Apr-24 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	19, 19 more TRU


[04-Apr-24 10:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	I put a shipping contract up for 19 TRU from MOR to Kinza on the Kinza LM.  If someone can move it for me we are onto the next level.


[12-May-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	Whoops! Forgot to vote for the COGC


[14-May-24 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	oh that explains why my hydro farms are producing less


[17-May-24 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	You can always put ahippings MOR -> KINza. I go that way quiete often


[17-May-24 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Also the other way around should have space from time to time :-)


[17-May-24 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	@Aufricer did you reply do zagurant's message from over a month ago?


[18-May-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	No. Just a general reminder. Not everybody is in the discord. And I realized new faces on the planet

**worvand**:	buying 5 MHL if anyone has extra repair supplies and want to sell them for a decent markup


[01-Sep-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	I will contribute to the hospital. I believe we wont need to feed the Inf for a while then. If Hospital is also 3 x INf (I asume that from my experience from Safety station and drone post)


[07-Sep-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	I make plenty of TUB now so it's basically free for me.  and OFF isn't too expensive


[15-Sep-24 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	Good. I wont maintain my IC-162 base for  a while. So no GL and TUB productivity as usual


[15-Sep-24 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aufricer**:	But I have and still bring a lot of MAT.PK for the hosputal. If you check the population reports I would say pls. dont feed the Inf for a while. We should be doing well with health


[18-Sep-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	I'll stop feeding but it looks like the INF is resourced for like 2.5 months.


[06-Nov-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**worvand**:	thanks Ziggurantus


[06-Nov-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zaggurant**:	NP. My pleasure
