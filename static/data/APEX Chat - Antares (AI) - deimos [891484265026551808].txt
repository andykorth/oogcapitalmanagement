**RookSama**:	So I bought some Aluminium but nothing happens, not even a notice. But for overalls I get a fulfillment notice. Is that supposed to happen?


[28-Sep-21 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**derelict.**:	you can check the status of the order with CXOS -- usually it's because you didn't bid high enough to have your order fulfilled immediately.  what does the status of your order say in CXOS?


[28-Sep-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RookSama**:	Placed


[28-Sep-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Sep-21 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	I don't have any grand speech or promises. Rn ima just see when the tax comes in an start funding the SST, since it looks like Pio pop is getting close to 100% employment. Harmonia COGC is up and running, and repayment of the tax money I lent should happen over time.

**Madnewmy**:	no one has AL to sell here?


[02-Oct-21 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheOtherSeid**:	The AL price on the LM is low enough it's worth it to go to the CX


[02-Oct-21 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	meh


[02-Oct-21 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	not interested in ppl who have 20 AL to sell either


[02-Oct-21 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	which is about what sells per day on CX at higher prices v0v


[02-Oct-21 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheOtherSeid**:	nobody should be selling AL at 400/u. Even the 450/u on the CX is cheap. Construction is still very profitable with AL at 500/u even


[02-Oct-21 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	tru available for 200/u on the lm


[02-Oct-21 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Madnewmy**:	AL at 400 is literally a 16 days ROI, better than doing just about anything in game atm


[02-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	but heh


[02-Oct-21 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-21 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperyan**:	If you need it fast or want me to wait for a bit, then add a premium ;)


[19-Oct-21 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperyan**:	I've got about 400 t / m3 left (I know, I know) so should be plenty of space for you.

[20-Oct-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Madnewmy**:	dump*


[20-Oct-21 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperyan**:	Fair enough... I was going to say 22.5k... less than the CX but saves me a flight.


[20-Oct-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	yea my breakeven point on them would be 870/u so would make more sense for you to bring to CX in any cases

**DoopyDoopz**:	Ey, I'm a newer player coming back after a long time gone. Is there a resource I could look for average prices of materials. Looking to buy some BSE for constructions,


[31-Oct-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DoopyDoopz**:	nvrm, I figured it out


[31-Oct-21 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Platypet**:	hey what did you mean exactly? if you want to get the average price you can look the the nearest Local Market which is Antares I in our case here


[31-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DoopyDoopz**:	Yeah, that's exactly what I figured out.


[31-Oct-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DoopyDoopz**:	Looking for someone to setup an order for me for 16 BSE, offering price at 21,200 AIC for it but am willing to be flexible on the price.

[13-Nov-21 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DoopyDoopz**:	No, my roommate was on my account and for some goddamn reason he liquidated my company. So I tried carbon farming for a bit, hated it and then I came back


[13-Nov-21 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DoopyDoopz**:	I'll probably stay out of FIOA for now though


[13-Nov-21 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	No worries: I wouldn’t recommend Carbon Farming on Promitor anyway, C is quite heavy to transport so its better done closer to the consumer


[13-Nov-21 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Madnewmy**:	tons of hauling up


[17-Nov-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	did you see my offer?


[17-Nov-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	ahhh yea but I never need anything that way unfortunatly


[17-Nov-21 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	the offer of cheaper haulage for exchange of a small amount of AR?


[17-Nov-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	oh


[17-Nov-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	no


[17-Nov-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	just DM'ed


[17-Nov-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	but you are basicly asking me to pay 1.5x over what I usually pay so no


[17-Nov-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	depends on what your selling the AR for, but if you have enough people accepting the shipping it is fine


[17-Nov-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	its been selling at 300-400/u on CX lately


[17-Nov-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	in the last 7 days there are 2 transactions, some for 200 and some for 300, I have enough for 2 weeks, so i will see where the price goes


[17-Nov-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	I would of had a stronger argument if 200 units had not sold at 300 2 days ago, while offered at 400, it never sold at that price


[17-Nov-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	still


[17-Nov-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	even at 200


[17-Nov-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	its over what I would have paid otherwise


[17-Nov-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	so I don't see the point of your offer, more trouble, for me to pay more?


[17-Nov-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	true, but it was only 1k more, which is less than the increase in fuel cost in the past week to make the trip


[17-Nov-21 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	I was one of the people who brought some at 300, so its good


[17-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Nov-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	im hauling 20k in but idk when it will get here


[17-Nov-21 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	should I just ask for CX price for PE or go higher?


[17-Nov-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	well got em on CX


[17-Nov-21 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Nov-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	In the future, it might be better (unless you're super cash-strapped) to buy a bit of a surplus so you have some materials sitting around; even if you produce ALO yourself, it never hurts to have a small stockpile.


[23-Nov-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Michionlion**:	that can also minimize losses to fees -- you can always turn materials back into cash, at a somewhat reasonable ratio


[23-Nov-21 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	I welcome citizen Slomes contributions to climate change and look forward to him ending his own Smelters so as to reduce his carbon footprint even further. I already have ended all of my extraction operations some months ago.


[24-Nov-21 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	@Artokun I would recommend more extractors first, sell the ore and use that money to expand. A single collector should be enough for a long time. You may buy C, or buy GRN or MAI and burn it yourself. EXT and INC use the same experts. And buy FLX as soon as possible.

[25-Nov-21 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Do you have any raw resources or something smaller? I’ll happily make a 200-500 AIC ad with a long fulfilment time to help you out, but don’t really want to end up paying market rates for BDE I have no real use for.


[25-Nov-21 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	I've got ALO and AL


[25-Nov-21 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Ad is up for 10 ALO with a delivery time of 10 days. That should give you enough to do stuff, at least (and since I’m an ALO producer anyway won’t be sat around in my inventory being awkward, unlike AL or BDE).

[25-Nov-21 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	My tip would be to do some broad calculations. There's a lot of actions which are very clearly broadly profitable with even very quick sums. If you want to make optimal plays and such then you will need to devote a lot of time to calculations. But ultimately the key to being wealthy in PrUn is staying power.

[07-Dec-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Dec-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	if yes, how muc do you make on average carbon farming?


[07-Dec-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I do, but I just built the smelters. Previously I've been carbon farming and shipping it off-world to my other base


[07-Dec-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LunarSystem**:	i just started at that. Is there an association of carbon farmers here?


[07-Dec-21 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	carbon is slow, but always needed


[07-Dec-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	resource extraction bases on Deimos focusing on ALO and C can work very well, as long as you don't farm your crops on Deimos

**Erix_123**:	Started out as a carbon farmer not too long ago and I think I've been earning around 12000 AIC every two weeks just from carbon and selling on the markets


[07-Dec-21 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	The price looks like it's been dropping though, so I'm looking to try to find ways to consume it myself instead of selling it though


[07-Dec-21 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	Also for everybody, are the education events something recently introduced? And how would people feel about switching to increased efficiency for pioneers rather than metallurgy?


[07-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DoopyDoopz**:	AL for da win


[07-Dec-21 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	extract ALO, collect O, buy FLX and use your C for AL, and use your AL for bfabs with PP2


[07-Dec-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	10% bonus is almost always worse than 25% bonus on a production type. Deimos is the current AL capital and metallurgy is one of the best option.


[07-Dec-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	all options are available via the Chamber of Global Commerce (COGC ZV-759c). Results is decided by votes from PRO players, with different weights based on population

**DiggingLake**:	We already have a local Construction COGC, on Nike.


[08-Dec-21 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Narhoxide**:	Is it more profitable to deliver AL to other CXs, considering the fuel cost?


[08-Dec-21 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	depends on how much AL yyou have


[08-Dec-21 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	No, not really: there isn't that big a price disparity for AL and its not particularly easy to ship. Add in dealing with multiple currencies and you are much better off selling locally.


[08-Dec-21 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	An argument could be made for shipping ALO, but if you are trading across CXs you are probably better off doing it with higher value goods.


[08-Dec-21 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	You can run PP2s here to make bfabs.  They looks fairly profitable to me.  Most AL isn't traded, it's the bfabs and lfabs that are traded.


[08-Dec-21 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	This is why I never really care what the price of AL is


[08-Dec-21 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	shit is also much cheaper on other CXs, especially stuff like rat/dw on HRT. Really depends on how you want to manage your ressources


[08-Dec-21 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	but yea BSE/BBH are much easier to transport and cash dense, much better thing to base yourself out of

**SpaceWalrus**:	I can outline a p2w feature that i think breaks the game for me. You can't but up sell orders outside the price band without a PRO account. Therefore, if say i tried to set up a Si operation (a metal that has low volume), I have no say on what price I can sell at since I'm not allowed to sell outside the price band. Currently, Si has offers around 750 AIC, if i wanted to post Si the highest I can is 250$ due to the price band. So basically ruins the game for me. Just wanted others to be aware of this so you don't fall into this trap. Overall, the game isn;t pay to win, but there are certain areas where the game breaks down if you dont pay.


[21-Dec-21 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceWalrus**:	looking to sell 96 aluminuim for 100 each. really just need to offload some metals


[21-Dec-21 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceWalrus**:	40 Si for 100 each if anyone wants it. reasonable price since im not a pro user


[21-Dec-21 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	@SpaceWalrus, the price band mechanism is kinda broke. If it is unreasonable then someone can pretty easily work with you to move 1 unit back and forth to manipulate it up/down as needed.


[21-Dec-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	i.e. I could buy 1 SI at your minimum price and the band will move down. We can continue as needed to open it up.


[21-Dec-21 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	Common problem for low/zero volume commodities.

**Mumzhar**:	it kinda covers going there, but not the way back. That's why I prefer to make two contracts to move a full shipload: people go to CX with their stuff and fill the remaining hold with contracts


[27-Dec-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**vaxon**:	hello am new here, can some one tell me if am stupid having 1 rig 1 farmstead and incinerator producing 4C from HCP and MAI instead of just riging water ?


[27-Dec-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	ive read on forum that rigging water is the best way to start as carbon producer


[27-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	probably dont want to be farming on Deimos, the soil fertility is a bit rubbish


[27-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	this setup is fine, just not on Deimos where fertility and water concentrations are low


[27-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	Harmonia's a good bet if you want to farm in the Antares region


[27-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	its 90% isnt that enough?


[27-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	that's a 10% time penalty on all the farm recipes


[27-Dec-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	it can be fine if you want to expand by adding an extractor for ALO and using your C to smelt it, just don't go farm all the way


[27-Dec-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	thing is its "fine" technically, but you can do it on other places more efficiently, or do a whole other thing that pays better, meaning either way you would grow faster


[27-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	I would recommend you just take a couple days and let it run, while you get familiar with the market, look at materials, etc., get informed, then make an educated restart :)


[27-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	ok. I was trying its always 3 unit of H2O i can collect in 6hours or is there any factor that affects that


[27-Dec-21 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	the 3 units is planet specific and fixed, but the time can vary depending on your efficiency


[27-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	on another planet you might get 10, or 20 per the same as you would get 3 here


[27-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	yeah i was thinking about restarting too, but before that happening wanna see how much money can i make


[27-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	Deimos is mostly domineering in ALO and AL industry, and also C production


[27-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	however C makers usually import the Agri materials from a better farm planet, and just burn them here


[27-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	in planet info in resources the value of material i collect depends on the length of orange bar ?


[27-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	you could always do some napkin math to check if it wouldn't be paying better if you skip H2O and agri production, and just buy inputs and make C, building more INC instead of the RIG FRM


[27-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	yep


[27-Dec-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	big bar =good, and for fertility, right side is +, left side is - buff or nerf to your production


[27-Dec-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	so y telling me fertillity can be over 100%?


[27-Dec-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	yessir


[27-Dec-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	:D


[27-Dec-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	interesting


[27-Dec-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	its perpetum mobile


[27-Dec-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	just think of the 100% as 0%, then it checks out


[27-Dec-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	xD


[27-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	but 100% makes sense as the center here because of efficiency calculation


[27-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vaxon**:	yeah y right xD


[27-Dec-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**rain9441**:	Hello Deimos!  I've brought up this topic ages ago and have not yet followed through.  The Deimos Shipyard!!!  Well, I've been able to put down my PP4s now and will be producing Afabs to donate to the SHY project.  If anyone else would like to participate, by all means feel free.


[07-Jan-22 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I'm currently working on ABH and ADE and will have just a few per day for now.


[07-Jan-22 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I'll be trying to donate round robin so that I dont complete one before another


[07-Jan-22 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	If you don't have a PP4 but want to contribute, the only thing I'm really missing right now is NR.  So if you have LABs but no PP4s, any donations of NR will go right into the PSY


[07-Jan-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I'd also like to spread one other peice of awareness.  I'm planning on starting a colony on A2D, which is next door to Deimos.  It has HAL and MGS.  My hope is to kickstart the settlers as best as I can during explorer's grace.


[07-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The local HAL source and future Chemistry CoGC there will double our chemistry capabilities here in the region and bring an excellent EPO factory closer to the the Deimos region.


[07-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	A2 is, IMO, the best system in the game.  With the PSY in place, we can handle an amazing amount of logistics with only cheap STL ships!


[07-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Moving EPO production to A2D will allow us to shift Griffonstone production to be more LABs.


[07-Jan-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	A2B is a good secondary colony to get as well as it onyl requires HSE to build on (no INS!).  You can stand up more expensive buildings there or just run Steel production like I do.

**Mumzhar**:	I don't have a PP4 yet but I have RSE and some TI I can donate towards ASE


[07-Jan-22 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jan-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kapusta**:	i gonna do some ADE for shipyard soon. and ASE after that. i can bring some TIO to Deimos if some one want to do ASE


[07-Jan-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mikalai**:	I can't donate NR at the moment, but I can buy some 8 afabs from a PP4 owner at reasonable price and donate those later on to Shipyard. Please post a sell on LM


[07-Jan-22 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	This is amusing timing as I was planning to annouce soon that Deimos would be seeking to buy the afabs for a Shipyard


[07-Jan-22 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I could have perhaps kept quiet, bought a few afabs, and suggested everything had gone exactly as planned. But the long and the short of it is Deimos Governorship has far too much currency locked up out of circulation, something that is demonstratably bad for trade. A Shipyard here is a brilliant investment that will benefit both large and small players (AL prices will boom when shipbuilding takes off in near future). I would be probably against raising taxes to fund it but with current Deimos finances that won't be neccesary at all.


[07-Jan-22 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	So, unless those inclined on donating to the SHY are hugely against I will be seeking to use the large Deimos treasury to benefit the economy and purchase Afabs to help this community driven endeavour.


[07-Jan-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Look forward to hearing others thoughts


[07-Jan-22 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	sounds cool, I'm sure i'm not the only one that would appreciate the extra trade that would come through here with a local SHY


[07-Jan-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	I see no reason not to use our tax money to compensate the producers if we have the funds available. My thanks to the very generous a-fab producers offering, but you do deserve to be paid.

[09-Jan-22 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	Whole ship available ANT > Deimos


[09-Jan-22 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Well a shipyard on Deimos opens up the way for STL ships in system, which makes some of the not so great planets in system suddenly very viable as shipping capacity drastically increases.


[09-Jan-22 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	The other good thing about a SHY here is that AL is typically the main component of ships (of the metals) and Deimos is already the best planet in the world for AL. So not having to ship lots of heavy parts (completed or raw materials) is a big plus.


[09-Jan-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Artokun**:	Hey deimos peeps, your friendly neighborhood AL.AI1 smelter needs some OVE, RAT, and DW. Competitive prices up in LM. I particularly need some OVE if anyone can spare right away.


[09-Jan-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	So after some number crunching I've come up with some 'reimbursement' numbers for Afabs to go directly to the Shipyard. The first thing to note is these are a little lower than perhaps someone could achieve on the open market. This is partly because the Deimos treasury can't fully stretch to full competitive market rates for all the remaining parts, but also as the costs are designed as much as 'reimbursement' for donation, to both compensate and encourage faster production. ABH: 19k ADE: 16.5k ASE: 16k ATA: 11k This puts the total cost remaining for a SHY as 1,410k. (A bit above current Deimos treasury but that's correctable with some donations)  People are of course entirely free to donate any Afabs they wish without reimbursement. All Afabs currently given are illegible for reimbursement. I'll wait a bit to get all of your feedback on this and therefore numbers may tweak slightly, but can hopefully roll this out. If you're planning on giving Afabs I'd therefore suggest holding fire


[09-Jan-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Formatting died a bit woops, but take away is reimbursement costs of: ABH: 19k, ADE: 16.5k, ASE: 16k, ATA: 11k.

[19-Jan-22 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Popr makes for mixed viewing. PIO still not good news, demand is increasing whilst quite a few inactive bases are being removed which is why we partly have the large increase in PIOs not actually translating to a total pio pop being much higher. This will resolve in a couple weeks and should only be effecting very large pio bases and large new expansions. Not ideal of course, but in grand scheme not catastrophic. Will get the SST2 finished before the next POPR and will continue to full fund, hopefully we can reduce this down in ~4 weeks.


[19-Jan-22 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Techs on the other hand much better news and continuing to grow, demand is waning though so perhaps will need to see if demand grows again or if we should reduce investment longer term. Finishing the next par level is definitely on the cards and will likely be next project after the SHY, even if its just to enable cheaper dw contribution.

**Broken_Marrow**:	Do we have a supplier for FOD or DEC to keep up our wildlife park? I've got a Promitor base that I could tool up to supply them.


[20-Jan-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	It depends. Do we need it? That's depends. Are you planning to drop 400 extra demand for techs in two weeks time suddenly and need them all filled in a week? If not then the current input level is very adequate. I think FOD has potential, but it's benefit will be limited without increased demand.


[20-Jan-22 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broken_Marrow**:	Fair enough. Just thought I'd offer.


[20-Jan-22 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I will be looking to get the PAR up to level 2 in the near future (2-3 weeks) so that we can put in more DW. But ultimately this is relatively vanity. The tech issue only came from a sudden increase in demand in one week after weeks of unemployment. Ultimately, no matter the popi upkeep things like that will always cause issues. If you want to build more Tech buildings I would advise playing with POPI and not against, plan ahead.


[20-Jan-22 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	If you have cheap FOD going I'll definitely chuck it in though!

[23-Jan-22 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Michionlion**:	Hey FIO that 1 AIC spam on the LM is a little out of control. Would it be too hard to just sync up times once in a while? It makes it really hard to see actual ads.


[23-Jan-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	This is a sync up: a couple of ships full of supplies arrived at the same time. Generally speaking, we try to keep the ads at a higher than P rating to make it easier for others to see those selling/buying to the market.


[23-Jan-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	(Its a delivery of around 7 ships worth of consumables for 15 players, so there are a few ads needed. Most should be gone within a few hours.)

**DiggingLake**:	However, as long as the game requires LM usage in this way, there isn't any good way around there being lots of ads on the LM that aren't personally relevant to certain individuals: you could equally argue that spamming ads of the same product is an issue, since they make it hard to see other ads.


[23-Jan-22 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	(In any case, as I said, most of the ads should be gone in a few hours.)

**Scorus**:	The way around it is to put up the ads when people are ready to accept them.


[24-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	FIOC as a Corp has quite a large presence on Deimos. I think we have 15 different players serviced in some from through Deimos. These players all have very different playing hours and lives. We have people who cooperate together yet do not have overlapping active hours. To a large extent this is just a natural outcome of an international game. We would certainly welcome suggestions of how better to organise distribution of resources within the limitations of people's real life commitments and the games mechanical limitations.


[24-Jan-22 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Though I do think it worth noting that the vast majority of these ads (99%) are gone within 10 minutes and it is highly unusual for a notable number of ads to last more than 6 hours (the ads currently there are not the same ones as when the situation was first complained about)


[24-Jan-22 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	I thnk it's just the game not really having the tools required to filter the noise out/there not being a better method for private trading. I don't have an issue with it personally but it would sure be nice if i could filter by say, required grade to get a clean view of what's for sale

[28-Jan-22 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Red_Phoenix**:	ok yeah i did overstate it


[28-Jan-22 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	but pretty much all the constructors here are making bfabs out of AL


[28-Jan-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	the price of AL isn't that depressed, it's just people's obsession with being the lowest offer lol


[28-Jan-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Caydel**:	Perhaps... I mean, I need to sell mine for cashflow, so I go lowest offer. It's only a race to the bottom when supply exceeds demand

**Namthorn**:	if you need to sell right then then sell at the bid


[28-Jan-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Feb-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	also, make a STO, super useful for inventory management lol


[03-Feb-22 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	how much per unit? i can put a buy up


[03-Feb-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	My advice for you Red, build an STO, then more ext/smelters until you have 11 smelters to 5 ext and 1 col. then make a bass next door on Nike and make just pp2s, ship the AL there to take advantage of the construction buff


[03-Feb-22 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	Any people (presumably with Harmonia bases) interested in an ongoing deal to fill RAT and DW COGC demands. Internal supply at a bit of a pinch point recently so would be good to get a deal for Deimos


[04-Feb-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperyan**:	Anybody got anything coming back from ANT? I've got a lot of high value / low mass cargo coming back so I've got space in the hold...


[04-Feb-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperyan**:	Post (at reasonable rate, you know who you are...) and I'll pack it up for an overnight transit.


[04-Feb-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	a PP4 isnt going to get you a lot of afabs.  It's only the tip of the iceberg.  You need a solid foundation of labs, EPO production, STL production, and so on.


[04-Feb-22 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	A single PP4 probably requires and consumes an entire base worth of resource output


[04-Feb-22 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	If you look at an ASE.  That's 2 TI and an RSE (1.5 SMEs, 2/3 PP3).  The PP3 eats up 200 EPO/day, which is 4 POLs.  It also eats 1 STL/day and 2 BSE a day, which is a good chunk of money.  The 4 POLs need 2 CHPs which need EXT-HAL.


[04-Feb-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I mean... just making ASE in a PP4 probably costs 15k/day to feed


[04-Feb-22 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	IMO best way to support building UNI is expanding to add all the components of the chain and then do the PP4.

[08-Feb-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	So looking at the new popi changes its not looking like any of the programmes will really impact Deimos POPRs hugely initially, but it may impact demand of Engineers on this planet just if they're so much easier to get people might be interested. So i'm thinking doing the 25 Engineer boost first then seeing how things settle and if people indicate there will be more engineers (or even scientists) we can go from there. I'm not expecting any tax raises at all as ultiamtely if people want scientists or engineers they can just pay to produce 25 themselves


[08-Feb-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I do say this 12 hours before the next POPR which could change things (if there's say 200+ sudden demand in techs)

[14-Feb-22 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-22 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	what's the real benefit of a glass ship here?


[15-Feb-22 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	is it just making the other planets in the system more worthwhile?


[15-Feb-22 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	yea, theres a H planet and FEO planet in the system


[15-Feb-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	trace amounts of other things too


[15-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	gotcha


[15-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	so I was wondering - where would be a good place to make a second base?


[15-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Red_Phoenix**:	is it a mostly subjective thing based on what I wanna do?


[15-Feb-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	yes


[15-Feb-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	I know that one of my plans is be more or less independent for food supplies, so my next base is going on Harmonia


[15-Feb-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	people broadly take three tacks: 1. compliment their first base, 2. do something completely different, or 3. do the same again elsewhere


[15-Feb-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	i'd say only caveat would be stick to a relatively easy world to settle, don't want to be adding INS to the cost of your second base unless you're making stupid amounts of cash already


[15-Feb-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	also, the second base is the hardest one to build


[15-Feb-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I remember barely scraping together enough stuff to put down the minimum viable base here (this was my second). my third base was "eh, I have some extra cash so I may as well"


[15-Feb-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	exponential growth is great :)


[15-Feb-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Looking to buy some lfbas to finish off the Art Gallery, let me know if you're a Lfab producer :)


[15-Feb-22 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

**yaro111**:	Lta and lbh I added. Rest lbh I will add tomorrow


[15-Feb-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I had 7 so LBH done. If anyone would be able to even loan the lde and lse before POPR that'd be neat


[15-Feb-22 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	DEC may be more problematic though thinking about it


[15-Feb-22 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	But tech demand hasn't increased so will see them start to get increasingly unhappy. But all in all seems quite good, everyone is able to easily get the populations they want for very little POPI investment.

[17-Feb-22 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	Your better buying the lst on Nike for 38-40 each, 183 is a full load, 12 hours each way on low fuel, al sells well on Nike lm too (185 full load) or there’s a couple of us who can provide a load to take


[17-Feb-22 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	you should consider another base on Nike for your pp it has the 25% construction bonus and all the lst you could possibly need.

**Mumzhar**:	I'm selling shiploads of iron ore on LM ZV-759b, but shipping to Deimos is an issue


[26-Feb-22 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Mar-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	No program will be running with POPR btw, We've got mass unemployment across the board currently. I'm aware of some Engineer potential demand but it seems unfair to risk Deimos tax on potential when we could just wait a week and deal with absolutes. Especially since there's about 50 unemployed engineers anyway.


[01-Mar-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nirces**:	all the parts are sold on the CX


[13-Mar-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	you will need a BRS (215k) a CQT (130k), a GEN (160k), 1 SCB (40k), 1SSL(~20k but missing from CX), 40 SSC (10k) and 43 BHP or LHP (also not on market, LHP are cheaper and lighter = less fuel, but take more damage)


[13-Mar-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	will set you back ~ 650k, or you can try buying the parts and shipping them, combined space is more than 500m3


[13-Mar-22 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Mar-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Ah. Have you had a rapid expansion this week? It often is just a limit on the pios availble for redistro midweek that causes issues.


[13-Mar-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I would be very surprised if we've used up 7k of PIOs without a considerable number of new bases dropping


[13-Mar-22 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	as far as I understand POPR: there were 12.5% unemployed pios of previous population (74,788) available before POPR, or ~9348. During last POPR, they were all educated into settlers and current unemployment rate of pios is 0%


[13-Mar-22 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	to counter workforce redistribution argument: I haven't built any pios buildings this week, and 0 pioneers are available to me if I build a new one


[13-Mar-22 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	new pioneers should arrive during next POPR, with maybe a second week needed before it stabilizes again


[13-Mar-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Tacogamer20**:	I just put down a 14 EXT base and I am currently limited to the 200 that spawned with my base. Knarf from our corp is reporting the same issue as Mumz; zero PIOs are available to him. The last POPR showed a loss of 9k PIOs to SET, so I agree the problem is most likely that the education pull has stripped the unemployment pool


[13-Mar-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Mar-22 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Fairone**:	Just to understand this correctly - The population on Deimos is 58.227 pioneers - The unemployment in 0,0% - If I construct a pioneers building fx. Smelter - Is there no pioneers to work on it ?! (I have a capacity of 300, but only 200 in current workforce)


[16-Mar-22 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	Yes that's correct


[16-Mar-22 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	Your 200 pios get distributed evenly when building a new smelter


[16-Mar-22 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	You can still build it and it will still work. It's just that if you have a workforce of 200 pioneers with 250 jobs, all those buildings will get a 80% efficiency modifier


[16-Mar-22 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	until next POPR


[16-Mar-22 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	ok super smart - so this is a game, with reduced effiency is you expand - lol


[16-Mar-22 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	so new players will hit the "wall" after 7-10 days - super smart


[16-Mar-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	how will get more to play the game then ?!


[16-Mar-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	normally you will get all your pioneers with next popr at the latest. But there was a new mechanic introduced with last patch (governors can run different programs) which we don't know the outcomes yet.


[16-Mar-22 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	Deimos ran a education program which lead to many pioneers getting settlers


[16-Mar-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	so the advanced players "the old ones" - can make a setup that stops the newcomers - ?!?


[16-Mar-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	room for improvement - if you want people to play the game


[16-Mar-22 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	it's not intentional, as everyone needs lower tier workers and the goods they produce


[16-Mar-22 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	was just an admin error which the gov is gonna fix next popr


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	And the next popr is in ?? days


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	it's every week


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	last one was ~8 hours ago


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	So its up to "Bobemor" to change it in 7 days ?!


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	to make sure the infrastructure is in place and maintained to attract more pioneers to deimos, yes


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	it should balance out naturally provided we dont have any more edu 3 programs ran


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	So if "Bobemor" don't change it - We will have the same problems the coming weeks


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	if the same thing as last popr was done blindly then yes


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	but bob has clearly acknowledged the issue


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	so i doubt that will happen


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	So the Gov don´t understand the mechanic's ?


[16-Mar-22 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	Lets be sure to re-elect him


[16-Mar-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	No one understands the mechanics yet, as the feature got introduced recently


[16-Mar-22 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hildron**:	It's trial and error to get some data to figure out underlying formulas


[16-Mar-22 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	do you know if the nerf to edu 3 has happened yet or is it still a flat 0.3 added onto the education rate?


[16-Mar-22 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-22 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	To put it simply: yes I messed up. I misread the previous POPR. I didn't quite realise that the totals given in it were for before the change in POPR, that isn't actually a new change so that was dumb from me. I'd already set the Edu3 to start when Tacogamer highlighted the issue, so there was nothing that could be done at that point.


[16-Mar-22 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Currently I'm trying to work out whether Festivites III or Family Support III will have the biggest impact. There's still a few days left for that though, so i'm not going to be rushing that decision at all.


[16-Mar-22 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	The SST is fully equipped, with no further action we will see PIOs go to above 70% happiness and start growing sharply, so that's at least some positive. But currently trying to establish which will have the most impact to 'right the ship' fastest.


[16-Mar-22 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@Fairone you are absolute correct, this situation does suck, and it will be most felt by newer players. (I'm going to be sure to feed that back to the devs). It may not mean much but to some extent I think it shows some of the strengths of PrUn, this was a (foolish) player decision, that has had an impact on other players, which will have market impacts on the economy (AL production will be done a notable amount for a week). It shows the connection of systems together in the game coming together to effect one another, which would be great to see if it wasn't my fault!


[16-Mar-22 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	You are also absoluely able to not vote for me again, the election opens in less than a day. I will run again almost entirely to try and sort the mess that I made, but anyone is free to run against me, and anyone is free to vote for someone else.

[16-Mar-22 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tacogamer20**:	I ran what I pointed out by PiBoy and even he vouched for Bob's plan of using open jobs to spawn PIOs. These mechanic changes have no precedent, and it is an unreasonable standard to expect every player to be perfect at their jobs. Bob is working to correct it, and that is good enough for me. I see no reason Bob is unfit to get re-elected.


[16-Mar-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I wonder if part of this is that they only rolled out part of the government changes that they had planned together? The other part spread the work across multiple people, which might have allowed for some mitigation.

[17-Mar-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tacogamer20**:	We all recognize that a loss of PIOs impacts newer players the most. Yes, it is easier for older players to be less frustrated. However, we all agree that a PIO shortage needs to be corrected quickly, and Bob is working on it as much as any other governor could and would.


[17-Mar-22 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	Ofc mistakes are made np. Its more you have a game mechanic, where "top" players can stop "newcomers" from expanding and implementering mechanics where nobody or few understands the implications. Both will limit expansion or slow down the games progress.


[17-Mar-22 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	But it a learning game - so no worries


[17-Mar-22 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Just to clarify, there is absolutely not malicious intent behind this, incompetence perhaps, but definitely not maliciousness


[17-Mar-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	To some extent if this problem was to persist and some older players were to intentionally keep trying to reduce Pios it would actually effect the largest pio bases most and smaller likely newer players least due to how the redistribution works.

[17-Mar-22 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AttilaZeHun**:	because the price of silicon ore itself hasn't actually changed much


[17-Mar-22 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DiggingLake**:	Eh, if I'm still around in a couple of months we'll see if you can pay me back the principal (0% interest). But its too hard to get started in this game, and since you say you have a plan for the cash I trust you'll put it to good use.

[18-Mar-22 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-22 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AttilaZeHun**:	true on the last part but thats a problem with cartels in general lmao


[18-Mar-22 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	Turns out mass planet wide festivities results in a pregnancy boom. Who knew?


[23-Mar-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	But in other news my understanding is that we now are back with a PIO surplus. I'm going to try and steady the ship for the next few POPR: no programs, just SST feeding and a bit of PAR.


[23-Mar-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@Troqueon I think the current understanding is it just ads a flat 20%. Higher pops aren't happy but they're artificially very high right now with next to no demand. Scientists will leave if no one wants them here and no one really wants any Engineers.


[23-Mar-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(They've also got quite a lot of pop to burn through before anyone's in danger of losing any)


[23-Mar-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Wait, okay, I still don't get it. If we have a PIO surplus, why does it say "Open jobs: 7,878" on the POPR?


[23-Mar-22 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Ah. Looking through the last couple of POPRs, while the Population given refers to the number *after* the POPR, Happiness, Unemployment and Open jobs evidently reference what each of those were before the current POPR. That seems like it's deliberately confusing, but okay. Will stop with the questions for today.


[23-Mar-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Caydel**:	How can you see current available PIOs? I saw the same as Triqueon, and assumed we still had a 7.8k PIO deficit


[23-Mar-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Caydel**:	so I was holding off building more today


[23-Mar-22 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	should be the number in brackets in the construct buffer


[23-Mar-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tacogamer20**:	I was also confused on how the POPR reports work before I talked with PiBoy about the backend mechanics. The POPR is generated piecewise, with a few feedback loops. The end result is that some of the numbers (open jobs and unemployment) are reflective of the beginning of the generation process, and some numbers (migration) are generated towards the end.


[23-Mar-22 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tacogamer20**:	So, yes, the POPR can be extremely confusing and easily misinterpreted

***Eremita** joined.*


[23-Mar-22 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	number in brackets in the construct buffer is the maximum number you are able to get if you build right now. Total available number is a bit higher as there are limits to prevent someone from grabbing all of them


[23-Mar-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	7,878 is the number of open jobs we had when the POPR started calculating. We've then have 13,079 be created. So we should have a 5,201 pio surplus.


[23-Mar-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	We then get into the sticky territory of the reserve pile and how that's divided, which is very unclear. But everyone (who wants) should absolutely be able to build a couple buildings worth of PIOs at least without any issues.


[23-Mar-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Easiest way to see is build the building and see, if it doesn't let you have enough pios you can always deconstruct within the first few hours for free (i think till it hits 24 hours)

**Namthorn**:	is it just me, or does the next CoGC program say "resource extraction", despite the overwhelming majority voting for metallurgy?


[30-Mar-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I just went and voted for metallurgy and now it says metallurgy


[30-Mar-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	it's probably a bug, but I suppose it's possible that my votes are the only ones that matter

[31-Mar-22 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Depends on what you're trying to do, I guess. Making money, you're better off with most other things. If you want a self-sufficient base: Possible, but exhausting on Deimos. I'm barely keeping my 500 workers supplied with 2 rigs, 2 farms and a food processor (although the farm does produce some side stuff


[31-Mar-22 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Apr-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Apr-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fairone**:	or is Harmonia the best option


[07-Apr-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**thejeffcooper**:	I make my food in HRT space (promitor + avalon) and import it when I'm coming here for AL


[07-Apr-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	There's at least one planet with better fertility and h2o/o (both of which, I believe are prerequisites for fertility) 4 or so jumps away


[07-Apr-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	If it matters, I can look it up, it's on my list of possible planets for a second base.


[07-Apr-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	It's nearly uninhabited though, so you may get better efficiency/bonuses elsewhere where theres a COGC or the like


[07-Apr-22 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Ok, nevermind. KI-446b is 8 Jumps from ANT, at which point you can just try for promitor, which has more O, more H20 and HAL and N. Unless Promitor is full, that makes it the strictly better option


[07-Apr-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Etherwind is another decent candidate, although it has rather low fertility

**Bobemor**:	@alucard998 the engineers happiness is kind of wrecked by the recent weeks unhappiness. As those averages improve due to the demand should move in the right way. But that will take a few weeks and likely of less before we get more. As for POPI investment that could help I think finishing the Art Gallery then supplying that a bit would be best for engineers


[19-Apr-22 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Happiness program could help but we'd need to bump the base happinness before otherwise it'll still be under 50% and not up to 70%. Targetted immigration campaign might help a bit as it'll add 50 new Engineers.

[19-Apr-22 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	As for the upkeep, issue is its expensive and only has a few people using it. Probably talking 5-6 players total. My general attitude is we'd be best looking at the lower stuff to make a platform for personal donations to have more effect. But I need to do some spend forecasting to see, it may be we have enough regardless and in that case its better spent than idled.

**Bobemor**:	Definitely need some more POPI and I think a happiness boost this week will work if we get more POPI. But as PiBoy says the main issue is TECHs suddenly exploding.


[20-Apr-22 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	The game as designed currently does not encourage sudden expansion of T3+ industries in one week.


[20-Apr-22 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	So general tip for Deimos: Great planet for metallurgy (Smelting ALO into AL). That means it is also pretty good for Extracting ALO and O, and also Constructing prefabs from the AL.


[22-Apr-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Others industries naturally do well, but those are the obvious ones that will be the most natural fits. Other oppurtunies may take a bit more research of markets but certainly are viable!

**Narhoxide**:	The majority of the users are probably using Steam, but what encouraged them to choose Deimos?


[26-Apr-22 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AegisXIV**:	i started on phobos because it was near an exchange and i wanted to mine iron. someone was posting that it was basically a trap that the tutorial lures you into and suggested mining AL on deimos. thats how i ended up here this week


[26-Apr-22 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	You did right to move to Deimos, Aegis XIV. Phobos offers very little iron. You would have been very inefficient. Deimos is the best planet for metallurgy in the area.

**Ariq**:	New, but PRO player looking to Ship some stuff, hit me up if anyone needs a shipper.


[27-Apr-22 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	POPR makes interesting reading. We're there with TECHs which is good, Engineers will sort themselves but we'd obviously like a bit sooner, how best to achieve this isn't straightforward. As some of the most obvious ways could pump up pioneer numbers even further. Though majority of that increase on chart is down to new bases.


[27-Apr-22 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(~55k spawned from bases it seems)


[27-Apr-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	They should crash down in happiness next week, but probably not enough if we go for another festivities... Will consider next steps. But if you really want engineers quickly I'd suggest looking at Art Gallery supplies.


[27-Apr-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(As a note for newplayers players: don't worry about POPI upkeep just yet, what you need more than gets solved by your taxes)


[27-Apr-22 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	As for shipping @Ariq I'd suggest checking out the LM on KI-401d. 15k for a ship is pretty good money for a new player in my mind


[27-Apr-22 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	Oh heck yeah @bobemore thank you!


[27-Apr-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Resource Taps on Gas Giants (GGs) are often great for shipping. They often more than pay for both ways as they know you don't have shipping to there, and they're usually very profitable.


[27-Apr-22 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	It's gonna take a whole day, and most of my fuel to get there.  Well, 30% fuel to get there.  But so long as I end up at a CX...I can just refuel there I assume?


[27-Apr-22 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Ariq what are the fuel numbers for Deimos -> KI-401d on minimum fuel?


[27-Apr-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	52 STL, 93FTL


[27-Apr-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	Not really sure what reactor usage is....But that's also at MIN


[27-Apr-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	But then it's 2.5 days...so I was going to try and get there in a day


[27-Apr-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	That sounds about right, maybe a little more STL would help the time.


[27-Apr-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	At 15k you can afford to go a bit faster though :P


[27-Apr-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	Fuel == STL, Reactor == FTL ?


[27-Apr-22 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	Ok, cool.


[27-Apr-22 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Fuel = SF and FF. SF is Slower than light Fuel, FF is Faster than light Fuel


[27-Apr-22 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Should I send my ship there?


[27-Apr-22 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I better contact user to save some contracts for me


[27-Apr-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	Right, got that Bob.  Just not exactly sure how reactor usage factor's in


[27-Apr-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@Whosrodrix the ads are open to all I believe, though yes may be wise to contact the user directly. They're very active on discord i believe.


[27-Apr-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	👍‍


[27-Apr-22 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@Ariq typical rule of thumb is minimum FTL and like 10% SF.


[27-Apr-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	reactor usage == FTL?


[27-Apr-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	while fuel usage (slider bar) is for (==) STL?


[27-Apr-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Yes sorry, you were right @ariq reactor usage = FTL/FF and Fuel usage = STL/SF


[27-Apr-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ariq**:	:thumbsup:


[27-Apr-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(Shows how much I pay attention to what the flight command actually says now!)


[27-Apr-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DiggingLake**:	If anyone needs fuel in a pinch on KI-401d, ping me in Discord and let me know. I move FF fuel through there from Hermes, and keep a decently large stockpile of SF to make sure my ships don't get stranded out there.

[02-May-22 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	@_InFinite Take your time and try to check out the handbook. You should be able a link under the Help tab. You should be able to find out what to do, depending on your starter pack.


[02-May-22 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	If you started on Deimos, I'm guessing Metallurgist, in which case starting to smelt aluminum is your best bet


[02-May-22 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	Either way, it's a slow game so take your time and read up through the handbook to get your bearings. If you feel like you made too many mistakes before figuring stuff out, it's pretty easy to restart and you won't lose out on too much but I would recommend that you at least have a good game plan beforehand so you don't make the same mistakes

**Bobemor**:	So, I've been worried about bumping up Pioneer numbers to much by just constantly running festivities so gave it a rest this week. Downside is that we didn't see a change in engineers, upside is we didn't have an explosion of pios (which will mess up safety and health).


[04-May-22 04:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Need to try and push up culture supply, but proving difficult with availabile resources on CX. Also the expense is a big issue. With the ballooning cost of the COGC upkeep (with very little tax increase) may need to re-evaluate engineer popi inputs longer term. Though do expect COGC costs to go down and taxes to go up slowly.

**Bobemor**:	@Triqueon luckily not!


[05-May-22 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	POPI upkeep counts for however much is given as % of total output. This is one of the reasons why upgrading (building multiple levels) of a building is often economical, because it means you can just rely on the cheaper inputs to provide the same total amount.


[05-May-22 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	1 fully upkeeped SST is a lot more expensive to maintain than 3 dw only upkeep SST, but provide the same benefit.


[05-May-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(I don't think its very good design, but it is the current situation)


[05-May-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Having looked again at the numbers I think Engineer Immigration will be more impactful for our situation than Festivites III. Slightly cheaper, will provide 50 engineers rather than 10-15, won't boost pioneers and settlers hugely. Only downside is it won't boost Techs, but they should be above 50% next POPR anyway.


[05-May-22 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Will holdfire a bit to fully consider it.

**DerpyTurtle**:	@_InFinite_ you can set up contracts for shipments in the local market, basically you can accept shipments, and if you have a ship there you can accept the 'crate' of goods, once you get to where ever the shipment is going, you can 'deliver' it and the person gets whatever was in the crate.

**Bobemor**:	POPR makes interesting reading (Deimos' often does as a lesson on how to have reasonably high skilled workforces on a budget) Engineer demand continues to increase, comfort starting to increase and therefore impact Eng Happiness. Ultimately though we need to boost Comfort and Culture both further if we want Engineers to pick up the pace a bit more. To do this i'm hoping to expand the PAR to make better use of plentifully supplied SOI. I'm also increasingly wondering if a UNI for the passive boost may be worthwhile.

**Triqueon**:	For those of us still learning: how does the uni give a passive bonus? Is that an effect unique to the uni, or do all infrastructure things give a passive bonus regardless of upkeep? And is there a resource where I can find this information without asking stupid questions?


[12-May-22 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	uni gives education when stocked, we don't have any education if you look at the most recent popr, and higher tiers of pop place a larger emphasis on education for happiness


[12-May-22 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	for a bit of reading


[12-May-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	additionally, education provides passive pop promotion

**Emperyan**:	Perfect, thanks!


[12-May-22 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Both the UNI and the (Library?) give a passive bonus to the chance of a pop educating to a higher tier, even when no upkeep is provided (0.02 and 0.01, I think, but I’m not 100% on those numbers).


[12-May-22 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	In answer to your other question, there are a couple of places (such as the PCT discord), but when it comes to POPI just ask: most players don’t really understand it or need to understand it anyway, so questions about it aren’t stupid questions. It’s a complex part of this game that the devs have intentionally hidden the numbers for and the player base has managed to extrapolate the values out across a long period of time.

**WhosRodrix**:	Deimos is poor choice for farming, if you'd like to stay near Deimos and in Antares, I'd highly recommend settling on a Planet called Harmonia, you will make significantly more money. You can reset your progress and company by pressing the NEW BFR button at the bottom left and typing COLIQ and hitting enter. Click on the agreement and then scroll down to liquidate your company.

**Bobemor**:	POPR largely as expected. If we can get culture up then Engineers will be happy as. Pio, set, and techs all in a very good place. Scientists though we'll they'll have to wait till after Engineers get into a better place (anyone wanting large amounts of Scientists on Deimos is crazy enough to wait a little)


[18-May-22 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I will start looking at building a UNI though, with the hope that that can reduce our POPI demand long term somewhat by providing a bit of Education boost to offset any happiness dips.

**WhosRodrix**:	When you have many different types of buildings doing different things, horizontal is the other way around, lots of just 1 or 2 types of buildings


[20-May-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	vertical is more - building a feeds building b feeds building c factorio style


[20-May-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	horizontal is multiple buildings that do different things, usually in the same industry though to make use of experts


[20-May-22 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Isn't horizontal: having a bunch of EXTs or a bunch of BMPs and etc?


[20-May-22 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	that would be one way to do it, another would be say, SMEs + GFs + FS's  ,

**4LpHaOnE**:	wtb 10 BBH & 10 BDE


[30-May-22 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Theres a BBH ad up on the LM


[30-May-22 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**4LpHaOnE**:	2k each is a bit much


[30-May-22 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Price on the CX is 2,2k


[30-May-22 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	If you find any for cheaper than that, more power to you. I doubt you will though.


[30-May-22 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Base materials are >1k each, plus 6h consumables time, which comes in at a couple 100 credits. You could import them en masse from one of the other CX, where they're cheaper because of better base material availability, but that isnt worth it below maybe 30 or so bc of fuel costs.


[30-May-22 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Eh, the "couple 100 AIC" for consumables is a bit high probably. Nevertheless, just the materials cost me 1100, and selling them any lower than 2k per for 10 is a loss when shipping them to the CX where I can reliably get 2.1k or more costs me at most 2.5k in fuel, less if I use a shipping contract or have other stuff going to the CX


[30-May-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**4LpHaOnE**:	when i try to buy on the market the API tells me my company rating is insufficant what does that mean?

***4LpHaOnE** deleted this message.*


[30-May-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**4LpHaOnE**:	and where i can see my own placements on the market?


[30-May-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Ah. Should have checked your profile. Local Market requires a Pro license.


[30-May-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	LMOS for seeing your Own orders


[30-May-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Or, to accept ads, a Basic license (which means you had Pro at some point in the past)


[30-May-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Since you still have a U rating, that means you only have a trial license and are limited to buying at the CX


[30-May-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jun-22 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jun-22 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	Ok, fun. Just looked at the chart for LDE because of this. Benten has the same low amount of transactions on this as anywhere else (5 a week or so), except last week, where out of nowhere 2811 went in what seems to be a single trade


[13-Jun-22 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	We call that 'nuking the market'


[13-Jun-22 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Triqueon**:	13.5M Credits in a single trade for a low volume good seems...excessive given the price moved by about 10% because of it. I mean, yeah, you could make that back with resale, but given the low volumes, even having a 20 member corp who are all building stuff you need LDE for it's going to take months to offload...


[13-Jun-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	Very good POPI today. Engineer happiness above 50% with no festival. This is a good sign. For the Scientists I'll run a program to generate a few then the best approach is probably to reach out to those who want the Scientists to see if they wish to support building a UNI or want to fund some more programs.


[15-Jun-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

**melon164**:	idk why though


[15-Jun-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alucard998**:	imo, they can finance the program then. engineers at least serve a metallurgical purpose. Scientists only do manufacturing, chem, and electronics, right?


[15-Jun-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alucard998**:	I guess san SPF maybe fits here, to avoid moving alloys, but I didn't look too deeply

[15-Jun-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jun-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	So I actually only need 4


[16-Jun-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	but I'm a bit short on monies right now, my stuff is on it's way to the CX. When It's sold I'll be able to pay


[16-Jun-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Ship arrives in 1d and it's 2.4k DW so I'm not sure how long it will take for some money to come in but you can set a long timer on the contract or something


[16-Jun-22 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alucard998**:	if you bump up the SF even just a few units, you can make the trip to cx in 6-10 hours usually


[16-Jun-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I'm familiar with Deimos Nike and Phobos shipping, but that's not where my ship is departing from


[16-Jun-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I make DW on Etherwind


[16-Jun-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**melon164**:	I have spare UPF time


[16-Jun-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-22 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I will now be taking this opportunity to take some photos of me shaking hands with local business leaders and workers.


[27-Jun-22 06:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-22 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nirces**:	Just Deimos Governors or all of us :P


[27-Jun-22 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Just Deimos governors. There will only be three cubicles in the whole campus. How do you think I've reached these crazy heights of tax revenue? Cutting toilet legislation has been a corner stone of each campaign.


[27-Jun-22 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-22 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's far more profitable to smelt it. I only have extra if I need FE or STL.


[27-Jun-22 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	The old large extractors are generally doing other stuff (Slomes left the planet, I’m a dedicated supplier). You can buy ALO, but you need to put buy orders up rather than picking up the sells: the main people selling ALO are newer players who need the faster turnaround that accepting an ad promises.


[27-Jun-22 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CANNAN5**:	I tried to sell ALO and when I went to fulf ill it took my ore and contract went away

[27-Jun-22 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-22 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Advent**:	I'll be selling ALO soon, but as was mentioned above, I'm a newer player that benifits from the quicker turnaround to try and get early infrastructure up. I'm only able to produce about 42 units daily as of right now

[30-Jun-22 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	Again, as I said before, its mostly new players: that is why you need to put ads up, since they need the quicker turnaround time and can't afford to sit around with large inventories like myself and Slomes could.


[30-Jun-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Insensless**:	Hello Deimos, I am running as a candidate for governor this election cycle. If elected, you can expect taxes to remain the same, constant programs, and Deimos will receive increased amounts of planetary infrastructure upkeep supported by the OOG corporation. As a corporation, we work hard to keep Antares planets stable and primed for future growth from all players within the system. Feel free to check the POPR of any OOG governed planet as evidence of this. As a player, I started on Deimos, and am heavily invested in its future. I look forward to your vote and your support. This should be a fun election cycle either way it goes!

**Bobemor**:	Hi Deimos, I am running for another term on governor. Things have been going very well for deimos recently and I'd like to continue to see that through. The university is near completion and that will vastly improve the ability for Deimos to support higher tech populations. But the way we've achieved this is something that is vastly different to many other planets, and this is what my governorship should be judged against.


[08-Jul-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	It has not been bought by the governor at the expense of tha taxpayer, nor has it been gifted by one rich individual or solo corp. It has been developed steadily as a partnership of multiple corps and the governorship. Parts have been procured in a cost effective manner which has meant that Deimos treasury remains in a healthy position.


[08-Jul-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	This is an attitude that has extended from the Shipyard to general POPI, and it is an attitude that have saved Deimos citizens a lot of money whilst still producing the POPR that benefit everyone.


[08-Jul-22 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Vote for me if you want to see Deimos funds continued to be leveraged effectively and efficently. Vote for me if you want to continue to see multiple parties (hopefully including OOG) working together on planetary issues. Vote for me if you want an independent Deimos.

**Insensless**:	Bobemor offers an independent Deimos that is funded by your revenue and managed by him. I offer you a Deimos that is funded by your tax revenue along with our corporate revenue and is backed up with all of our existing supply chains, ensuring current POPI and any future expansion needed. Allow me, and OOG to do the heavy lifting that is in Deimos’ best interest as a whole. A vote for me ensures the resources needed for quick and stable growth, along with the experience of governing not only 1 planet, but many planets over a large portion of our beloved Antares system.

**Bobemor**:	There was a good discussion in response to Insensless' comment on the UFO discord for those who might be interested in some of the deeper POPR discussions, it is a murky topic that the game is too great at making clear, so I would welcome any questions from both newer and older players if you have any :)

**AlphaAxis64501**:	im struggling a bit


[20-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	you'll need incinerator, 2 farmsteads, and 2 pioneer habitats


[20-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AlphaAxis64501**:	alright, ive only got one pioneer habitat rn


[20-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	check the recipes in the incinerator, there are several variants, and start making coal


[20-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AlphaAxis64501**:	i dont own an incinerator yet


[20-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	one habitat has space for 100 pioneers, each farm uses 50, incinerator- 40

**AlphaAxis64501**:	i see


[20-Jul-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**capi3101**:	Greetings, Deimos. Looking for a shipper to bring in two inbound loads from Antares Station. 3.6 tonnes / 2.85 cubic meters total in two ads, paying 2500 AIC a pop.


[21-Jul-22 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That’s an extremely generous reward for such small cargo


[21-Jul-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	ive normally done 6 AIC per volume/weight and it’s always picked up and delivered within 2 days


[21-Jul-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**capi3101**:	Got a large number of folks relying on the distribution of the consignment in a short time frame, hence the premium rate.

[22-Jul-22 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Do you have the cash for your trade? Are you hitting the buy button? Do you have space for the items?


[22-Jul-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**afkplshold**:	yes, yes, and yes. as soon as i click buy, the contract status changes to closed. however, if I open it up, the status in the index says it's still pending. and if i look at finances, simultaneously i have a deposit, actual price, and then a refund appear.


[22-Jul-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**afkplshold**:	cx


[22-Jul-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**afkplshold**:	i can't use local market. on a free account rn


[22-Jul-22 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Because I'm not aware of a closed status for CX


[22-Jul-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Or is it because you don't have space at CX to recieve it?


[22-Jul-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Ah, yes, in finance it would show all three, deposit, price, and refund, equalling out to the price only.


[22-Jul-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**afkplshold**:	oh my god wait


[22-Jul-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	You can collect on a ship by landing it at CX then collecting on the contract, or maintain a warehouse at the CX, which costs money.


[22-Jul-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**afkplshold**:	LMAO so simple now that you've said it out loud


[22-Jul-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**afkplshold**:	just sent a ship to cx. might have just spent lots of money accidentally lmao


[22-Jul-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	You can always relist it near what you bought it, or if you have enough cash, keep the extra supply until you use it.


[22-Jul-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	no need to bother rn, figure out if you want to get it as you learn the game


[22-Jul-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jackinabox**:	I don’t know. I bought pro day one and found it worth the $8 a month. The shipping contracts keep one busy and the cross exchange comparisons are very helpful.  If I like a game, I support it so it sticks around!


[22-Jul-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you have pro then you can sell on the LM or Local Market, which can be found listed under the planet's infrastructure projects


[22-Jul-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	Without PRO, you have to use the CX (Space Station). If you get PRO for a single month, you will be able to place and accept ads on the Local Market (LM). After that it drops to BASIC and you will always be able to accept ads, including shipping ads, on the LM. With basic, you just can't place ads.


[22-Jul-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CANNAN5**:	cant FX either which makes shipping difficult if you move full loads

[22-Jul-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	What do you mean colonize another planet? I thought that wasn't possible and as trial and basic you can't have more than one base.


[22-Jul-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	you can


[22-Jul-22 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	up to 5 I think


[22-Jul-22 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	you're limited my the max HQ level, which is 5 for non-pro


[22-Jul-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	Level 5 HQ gives 6 base permits. Level 1 HQ, which you start with, gives 2 base permits.


[22-Jul-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nE_GammaGam3s**:	how would one lvl up their hq


[22-Jul-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	Should I use 2 base permits for my first base?


[22-Jul-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	If you open a new buffer, use code HQ. That will open your HQ screen. There will be a list of materials that you need to provide to level it up.

[22-Jul-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jul-22 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	BS buffer


[22-Jul-22 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	It won't allow me to remove the permit. It has 1/3 permits at 25/750 area

**Cymatic_Flux**:	You need that 1 permit for your current base.


[22-Jul-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	Should be 500 area? 2/3 would allow 750 area. If at 1/3 maybe refresh the console so that it updates.


[22-Jul-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	How do i rebring up the system map?


[22-Jul-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	In a new buffer the code is MU NAV


[22-Jul-22 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	Or do you want the Deimos System Map? MS ZV-759


[22-Jul-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	Deimos System Map


[22-Jul-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	The Code MS ZV-759 will bring it up.


[22-Jul-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**nE_GammaGam3s**:	just curious if i don't feed my base with rations and such will they die?


[22-Jul-22 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cymatic_Flux**:	My understanding is they don't die, they lose productivity and happiness. If you supply them with nothing, they are 0% happy and stop work altogether.


[22-Jul-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	Personally, I like to imagine they are not starving so much as speding more time scavenging or growing bathtub mushrooms or whatever they can to get their basic needs met on their own, taking away time from working for you


[23-Jul-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	Is ALO a good money maker for new players?


[23-Jul-22 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's quick to set up and a good way to start before you get a good source of C or flux


[23-Jul-22 01:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	How do I get C or Flux?


[23-Jul-22 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Most players transport in C or FLX, but you could manufacture them here if you wanted to


[23-Jul-22 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	My starter package was manufacture


[23-Jul-22 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	How would I manufacture them?


[23-Jul-22 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	C is just made with incinerators and farms... while FLX is made with LST in a chemical plant


[23-Jul-22 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	How do you make Limestone


[23-Jul-22 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	The LST would need to be brought in from somewhere else


[23-Jul-22 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I would suggest looking at the recipes to make them and evaluate the costs to do so


[23-Jul-22 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	How would I evaluate costs? I like learning

**RNGzero**:	I would suggest Rain's master base planner (w/ FIO) or the PRUNer extension


[23-Jul-22 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Otherwise.. plenty of players have put together their own spreadsheets (including myself)


[23-Jul-22 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AbstractArtist4081**:	How would I do a spreadsheet, only made them in school


[23-Jul-22 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are many great videos on the web that go through the basics... it's using the basics to process the data in the way you'd like it


[23-Jul-22 01:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pimpernuckel**:	@RBGzero Where can I find FIO? googled it but didn't find anything


[23-Jul-22 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I learned by breaking down how other's have done it and cobbling something together


[23-Jul-22 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@Pimpernuckel, for the FIO site: https://fio.fnar.net/


[23-Jul-22 01:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	If you want the data steam (such as prices)... these are where to grab them: https://doc.fnar.net/#/csv/get_csv_prices

**Jobild**:	hey, does anyone know how I can go from "Unrated" to "Pending" in my company rating?


[24-Jul-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jobild**:	I tried looking it up, but the wiki said I need a Basic or Pro account. I am assuming the unpaid account is the one called "Basic", but I could be wrong


[24-Jul-22 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jobild**:	Sorry for the text wall, I am a new player who is trying to figure things out haha.


[24-Jul-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Pro is actively paying for an upgraded subscription, basic means you paid for a subscription at least once. Free accounts cannot access the LM to prevent new account harvesting abuse.


[24-Jul-22 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jobild**:	ah! thanks!


[24-Jul-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jobild**:	so I can not trade with other players unless I pay for an account?


[24-Jul-22 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jobild**:	or is there some other way I am not aware of?


[24-Jul-22 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	Without a Pro account, there is no way to directly trade with other players. Instead you need to buy and sell on the commodity exchange


[24-Jul-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jobild**:	ah, unfortunate


[24-Jul-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jobild**:	thank you for the pointers!


[24-Jul-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The LM carries more risky and complexity anyways while the CX is safer and carries no fees and better for new players in general.


[24-Jul-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

We'll look to improve culture for next POPR but also looking at how best to give ENG and SCI a quick boost that won't skew numbers for future. Leaning towards an ENG attraction campaign but would value others thoughts.

[01-Aug-22 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir-Francis**:	do fuel costs scale linearly with mass?


[01-Aug-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	there are many aspects which go into fuel costs


[01-Aug-22 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	mass is just one of them


[01-Aug-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir-Francis**:	for a given route, is it ~1.5x more fuel to fly a full ship as opposed to an empty one?


[01-Aug-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	You can test all this in the blueprints menu (new buffer -> BLU -> Create -> test)


[01-Aug-22 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the ship auto generated is a starter ship


[01-Aug-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir-Francis**:	nice, thanks!


[01-Aug-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	at lot of the time you'll noticed sliding the fuel usage to the right starts to costing more fuel than time saved


[01-Aug-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	as spaceships need to spend fuel to accelerate but also deaccelerate at their destination.

**Bobemor**:	Festivities project today had a big boost to help Pioneers get back to a large buffer, it looks like they likely would have stayed in the green without but i know this will eliviate some people's concerns. Engineer happiness is now about 50% (without Festivities boost) which is good and should stay there next week and beyond as we've been able to sustain the inputs. I'm setting up a Engineer attraction campaign so will get 50+ next week.


[17-Aug-22 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	FIOC very kindly donated the parts for two SST levels and two INF levels. I've set up both the SST levels with the hope that this means the unemployment level on pioneers is a bit less close to the wire (as this was causing some concern). Have set only 1 of new INFs to active as Health has never been an issue but may be useful to give it a small relatively cheap boost, but may drop back to 1 if it is overkill. (We have a large over population of Settlers currently)

**Bobemor**:	Hmm, interesting think the CONTD changes are starting to show on the tax returns with a noticable drop below what we'd expect (about 10-20k less). Not huge but just an interesting obeservation.

[22-Aug-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	74 new Engineers which is great. Though we now have a slight technician shortage, the continual sustained growth of Technicians has caught me a little by surprise. Its not chronic so a boost next week should sort it for a while. Looks like festivities next then back to some Engineer immigrationsnext

**Bobemor**:	So lots of new Techs which is great. Should be a surplus of slightly over 200. We should expect over 200 to grow next week, but recent trend mean we should see another 400 Tech demand which with some margins of error does mean it could be tight. Though we've got a massive Settler surplus so I'm reluctant to do another Festivities as it'll push out even more of them and we don't want them eating our fulfilment too much.


[07-Sep-22 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I'm leaning towards another Engineer program this week then festivities week after if Technicians are as close as I fear (they reasonably could not me). Will get another HAB to upgrade the PAR before the next popr and start the ball rolling on an ART upgrade.


[07-Sep-22 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	So if you make or sell HABs let me know


[07-Sep-22 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We need more of the higher tiers and fewer of the lower ones, wouldn't an education campaign solve both problems?


[07-Sep-22 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I was going to ask the same thing


[07-Sep-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I can supply a HAB either for pickup on Heph or I can get it delivered to Deimos.


[07-Sep-22 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Once I start production of it that is

[07-Sep-22 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	sure!


[07-Sep-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	probably 2w for that many, not sure on the numbers


[07-Sep-22 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	POPI to maintain higher tiers also makes lower tiers happy and therefore grow


[07-Sep-22 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Education Campaign may work if we get a few more Pios, but that is a good suggestion. Might be another FES then a EDU

[01-Oct-22 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So, you need to have a ship landed


[01-Oct-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Have a window set to fleet, code "FLT"


[01-Oct-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Click on the bar under cargo for the landed ship


[01-Oct-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That will open the cargo window


[01-Oct-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	you should be able to drag and drop anything from your base inventory to your ship inventory


[01-Oct-22 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	once you have moved everything over to the new inventory, you can fly it to the market at Antares Station and sell it there


[01-Oct-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	depending on your premium/account status, you can also sell ore to the local market


[01-Oct-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Got it, Thank you!


[01-Oct-22 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	no problem!


[01-Oct-22 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	How hard is it to set up another Mining base? Like if i want to extract Iron ore and bring it to my main base in a local system?


[01-Oct-22 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you go to the planet's info page in question and scroll to the bottom, there is a start base button


[01-Oct-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It will open a window that lists the base construction costs at the top


[01-Oct-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The standard is 12 PSL, 100 MCG, 4 LSE, LDE, and LTA


[01-Oct-22 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If the planet has unsafe conditions like extra gravity or too hot, other materials will be necessary too


[01-Oct-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	After you have the command module, each structure you want to build, like extractors, have their own cost as well


[01-Oct-22 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So generally, expansion costs a fair bit of cash, especially to newer players


[01-Oct-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That being said, this is Deimos, one of the best planets in all of Antares space


[01-Oct-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	ALO extraction and O collection can be extremely profitable


[01-Oct-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Yeah, i was looking to add FEO to my ALO production


[01-Oct-22 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Just in terms of income, id imagine anyone here would recommend maxing out this base for profitability before moving on


[01-Oct-22 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Maybe trading for FEO in exchange for ALO


[01-Oct-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Iron definitely has its uses, but Deimos is most well known for its AL production


[01-Oct-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Don't be afraid to maximize what you can, on any base, for what makes money, rather than trying to do everything yourself


[01-Oct-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And AL production here makes $$$


[01-Oct-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	ALO and O extraction too


[01-Oct-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Yeah, Oxygen was going to be my next building so i only need to buy FLUX and Carbon


[01-Oct-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-22 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	It depends how you're playing the game


[01-Oct-22 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	While you're on 1-2 bases... some player engage in shipping or CX Trading which makes things more active


[01-Oct-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	I legit didn’t stop playing the game the first month I started. I was working on loans and managing without a very large buffer


[01-Oct-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Swatacular**:	now I’m a little ahead with a good 10-20 day buffer for bases and I can relax a bit


[01-Oct-22 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	having a stockpile of consumables is big. It helps so mauch


[01-Oct-22 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I like to keep my stockpiles 2 times my logistical needs put even then oopes happen.


[01-Oct-22 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@Asper, yes, it is technically an idle game at a certain level of design


[01-Oct-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Wow, Its definity going to take some time to get more extractors. At 26,325 roughly each.


[01-Oct-22 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	pli pyrgos


[01-Oct-22 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@asper depending on your desire to stick with the game, there are a lot of corps recruiting folks willing to commit to be steady supplier of ALO and O


[01-Oct-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or be a hero and settle a CUO planet xD


[01-Oct-22 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-22 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	@RNGzero a CUO planet?


[01-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	CUO is just copper ore


[01-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	I'm liking this "game". its definitely scratching an itch.


[01-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Wait is copper just crappy to mine or somthing?


[01-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	copper tends to appear in the ouuter regions and is quite heavy


[01-Oct-22 08:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Magyk**:	Hi, I'm a new player. Just asking, the Deimos planet information showing that fertile soil is center to left meaning the soil not fertile but in construction of farm show that fertile soil is a yes. My question is, can farm be build and produce on this planet?


[01-Oct-22 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	I would settle a CUO planet is someone paid for the start up requirments


[01-Oct-22 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	@Magyk, yes you can farm Deimos


[01-Oct-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it has a slight negative... but the vast majority of planets canot have farms on them


[01-Oct-22 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Magyk**:	@RNGzero meaning that even it show slight negative, still can farm. Thanks for the answer.


[01-Oct-22 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I have... 1 that I use regularly


[02-Oct-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Aeper**:	I'm look at your screens and tiles trying to get a gist of what you are looking at. I can't do much atm. But i am starting to enjoy the logistics side of this game. but with new ships costing 5+ Million makes it kinda hard to expand


[02-Oct-22 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	a cheaper option is upgrading a ship's cargobay to take more per trip


[02-Oct-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or you can get a cheaper STL only ship near a CX for Phobos/Hephaestus


[02-Oct-22 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Wait, You can make a ship that doesnt have FTL?


[02-Oct-22 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Yes, also the cheapest engine is a GEN. I make them BTW.


[02-Oct-22 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Wait RNGzero why would i want a non FTL ship? if its stuck in that system?


[02-Oct-22 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	STL only ships are super useful in that they are a quarter as expensive as any of the optimal FTL ships, so if you have two planets with a lot of shipping demand between them then it can free up your FTL ships quite a bit


[02-Oct-22 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Some systems, like Antares and Benten, have 4 planets with LMs and a CX. A STL only ship can trade amongst them all for example.

**Aeper**:	Ah, Thats understandable. Guess i need to look at the local markets more


[02-Oct-22 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	lol I have 3 data screens to do that..lol


[02-Oct-22 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Only 3? i could have sworn i saw 4


[02-Oct-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	(joking) But your stream definitely has some good info.


[02-Oct-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	thanks, glad you enjoyed it. Another will happen same time next week


[02-Oct-22 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Sweet, i'll def hop on it.


[02-Oct-22 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Is there a screen for something like route planning your ships? or do i need it to be at a location for me to get the fuel and time numbers for it?


[02-Oct-22 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	In the blueprint window there is a test ship tab. There you can see the fuel and time etc testing


[02-Oct-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Ooo, That is great to know. Looks like my 5.5 mil ship design can haul 2000t for 6156.95 at 3h 6m. from Deimos to ANT EXCH


[02-Oct-22 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Grandpa_Canuck, whats the going rate for ENG 500,000?


[02-Oct-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the cost of an engine depends on the type. The cheapest STL engine (GENs) are like 150k each


[02-Oct-22 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Looks like to double my ship cargo it will take 550,000 per ship


[02-Oct-22 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I can sell you 22.


[03-Oct-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	CX price?


[03-Oct-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonke**:	Yeah that works for me


[03-Oct-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonke**:	I made a LM ad just over CX


[03-Oct-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Just sent a regular contract next time and save the ad fees


[03-Oct-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonke**:	Thanks for the trade!


[03-Oct-22 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	If I can spare it, I will sell it, if it is needed.


[03-Oct-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	If you need a regular supply just sent a contract.


[03-Oct-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Wait wait, Is it 2 Smelters Per Extractor for AL chain? and 4 if using FLX?


[03-Oct-22 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	exact ratio depends on your experts, but one extractor won't sustain 4 smelters. and you always use flux


[03-Oct-22 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Well, Looks like i need to fix that


[03-Oct-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	consider importing e.g some FEO and smelting that when you run low on ALO, it helps


[03-Oct-22 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Though i'm currently sitting at 1 Extractor and 1 Smelter, So best bet would be to expand to 2 smelters, Collector, and Extractor? for the short term?


[03-Oct-22 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	yes, and 3rd smelter after that


[03-Oct-22 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Isnt that third smelter going to sit idle from time to time though?


[03-Oct-22 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	not really- you can usually buy cheap ALO on local market


[03-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	would need x2 ALO ext for 4 smelterd... but that ratio can change with experts


[03-Oct-22 08:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	smelters will earn you the highest profits, extractors and collectors mostly just reduce your costs


[03-Oct-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Gotcha, Definitly good to know. Roughly looking at a decent profit to buy everything at current rates.


[03-Oct-22 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Is there a way to see how much a resource extractor/collector/rig will extract per cycle without building one?


[03-Oct-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aeper**:	Anyone need something shipped from AI1 to Deimos?


[03-Oct-22 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-22 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	That was a good discussion a couple days ago. Deimos has been able to be so lowly taxxed because of a wide range of donations. Personally I'd prefer if we could keep that up. It brings more people into looking after POPR, which is a large game mechanic that many don't interact with, as well as producing lower costs for all.


[21-Jan-23 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	But of course if that is no longer working then we should revist things. I can see though that one player has donated a large amount of UTS into the ART, so we're sorted for a little bit.

**Bobemor**:	A level 1 building with two inputs filled provides as much as a level 2 building with 1 input filled.


[22-Jan-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Since 1 input is cheaper than the others it's better to upgrade and just fill the cheapest input.


[22-Jan-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	With our ART it would be much better to use DEC to upgrade the building to level 3, so we can use more UTS than to put the DEC in as an input.


[22-Jan-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(So if anyone has 14 DEC please feel free to donate it to the ART upgrade! :P)

**Yawnder**:	Fulfilled. I don't mind the payment, but if you want, you can sell me 100 RAT for 10k in the next few days.


[24-Jan-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DiggingLake**:	I’d recommend starting with Rigs on Promitor. The H2O price right now is crazy, and Promitor is a good planet you can’t get on without starting there.


[25-Jan-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Oddthingsarefun**:	im on deimos


[25-Jan-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Oddthingsarefun**:	the collector aint doing anything


[25-Jan-23 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	(Deimos is a decent planet, but most industries accessible to new players that are good on Deimos are going to get hit by the double whammy of high water prices and high carbon prices.)

**Oddthingsarefun**:	pain


[25-Jan-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Oddthingsarefun**:	how


[25-Jan-23 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	By using the COLIQ command


[25-Jan-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Oddthingsarefun**:	then i just pick that planet


[25-Jan-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Basically. You select the proper starting package and the planet.


[25-Jan-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Oddthingsarefun**:	which package


[25-Jan-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Oddthingsarefun**:	for h20


[25-Jan-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I linked the packages earlier so take a look and see what is meant to have RIGs.

I find it great to see people willing to engage and get involved. For many planets the 'do it for you' model of governorship works very well but trying to do the 'do it with you' model here which hopefully gets more people engaged :)

**Sanggo**:	I'm leaving empty in a few hours for Harm (2k/2k) and ANT (3k/1k) at the same time. I'll take all orders at a reasonable price and a minimum load of 250kg or m3.


[04-Feb-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	What is reasonable for ANT?


[04-Feb-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sanggo**:	For example, I pay $10 per t/m3 unit for short distances. So maybe 3k for 500m3/500t seems like a reasonable price to me.


[04-Feb-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Alright. How much space left you have?


[04-Feb-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sanggo**:	Im empty, so 3k/1k


[04-Feb-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Two ads posted :-)


[04-Feb-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sanggo**:	Srr, i missclicked termination


[04-Feb-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	If ever you need more time for whatever reason, I'm not in a hurry so I'll extend.


[04-Feb-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Humn... I'll see how that works


[04-Feb-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	I don't see any termination requests


[04-Feb-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	Ah, there it is


[04-Feb-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yawnder**:	The contract isn't stated for terminaison though since you picked it up I think


[04-Feb-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sanggo**:	3h till dock at ANT :)


[04-Feb-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**PiBoy314**:	21 shipping ads for 10,000 AIC posted going from ANT to Deimos. If you have free ships, it's a great way to make money!


[05-Feb-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	(On the ANT LM), the command is LM ANT


[05-Feb-23 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sanggo**:	One of the few who aren't afraid to pay a little extra. :)


[05-Feb-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep, might as well. I've got the cash lying around and it gets people moving


[05-Feb-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'd also like to limit it to 4 contracts per person, if possible. More will be available as needed.


[05-Feb-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sanggo**:	I'd take them all for that price :D , but I'll leave some for others :)


[05-Feb-23 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Feel free to take more once you've delivered a couple


[05-Feb-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Also, if I notice you taking a bunch, because I didn't communicate a limit, I'm going to block you from taking more. No hard feelings, and not meant in the way block is normally used. I'm just using the limited tools at hand to enforce that condition.

[08-Feb-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Galaxyz1**:	make 4 oxygen and use it to buy carbon till u can produce carbon if you need carbon


[08-Feb-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RollenUdan**:	Thank you


[08-Feb-23 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Galaxyz1**:	ofc whats your prof


[08-Feb-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Galaxyz1**:	for metalurgy i started with the collector and farmstead, my apologies i use the farmstead to make 4 GNR and sell that for carbon not the oxygen, i use the oxygen to sell and to feed my smelter.


[08-Feb-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RollenUdan**:	I have an extractor and 2 smelters


[08-Feb-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Galaxyz1**:	be careful that carbon will get expensive if you dont have something to offset it


[08-Feb-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RollenUdan**:	oh I noticed lol


[08-Feb-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Galaxyz1**:	Ill be making carbon soon thankfully


[08-Feb-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	On Deimos you are probably better off buying GRN, HCP or MAI and burning it in an incinerator to make carbon rather than having a farm to grow it yourself

[10-Feb-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HanCholo**:	ahhh you need to buy it with your own cash?


[10-Feb-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Yes, those contracts are about obtaining the item from X-place so one has to do some research to figure out if it's worth the reward


[10-Feb-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**HanCholo**:	ahhhh i see, im really new so i didnt catch that. thanks!


[10-Feb-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

Looks like another SST is needed as well longer term, but the FESIII should save us for a while (the Settler overpopulation will be sad but neccessary)

**melon164**:	Even with a Magic Money Tree I don't think we could get them to grow more than ~25% faster than they are already, unfortunately

**Grandpa_Canuck**:	Oh, Magic Money Tree!  I WANT ONE!


[15-Feb-23 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Well, education could maybe be better fulfilled. Its only 23.8%. Improvements to that and perhaps a education program (at the expense of another) could def give higher than 25% current education in rate, I think


[15-Feb-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Nuc_Temeron**:	So, I was trying to figure out how many Pioneers I'll get in a coupla days. I was looking at the population graph for a while just now, it appears there's only about 1000 unemployed Pioneers on all of Deimos. If the trend on the graph continues, 2000 Pioneers will upgrade to higher tier professions. So does that leave absolutely no Pioneers for my base? I need 200 more...


[20-Feb-23 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	Discuss


[20-Feb-23 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	I agree something has to change. The percent unenployed has been dropping for weeks and at 0.6 wee could get to a shortfall.


[20-Feb-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	75% happiness is when the growth rate begins for a pop, right?


[20-Feb-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	70, if the wiki is right


[20-Feb-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	we are at 70.1%


[20-Feb-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	Right. Migration = growth, yes?


[20-Feb-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	My base is running at 47% efficiency so I am pretty desperate for my other half of the workforce to arrive


[20-Feb-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	But our gov may be also concirned with the lack of  pops--Tech and Engineers.


[20-Feb-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	Yeah the planetary project is Engineer Immigration


[20-Feb-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nuc_Temeron**:	I am pretty new so let me know if I'm misinterpreting this.


[20-Feb-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	The gov just needs to do some action. Maybe one of the festivals rather than the rng growth for a week or two


[20-Feb-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Grandpa_Canuck**:	This is not a crisis, just a wrinkle.


[20-Feb-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nuc_Temeron**:	You're referring to the 46.9%?


[20-Feb-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PiBoy314**:	I'm going to be posting another round of shipping contracts from ANT to Deimos for 10,000 AIC. Please limit yourself to 2 contracts to leave room for others to take them. The materials will not auto-provision and I will request termination if you take more than 2 contracts.


[20-Feb-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	What should the Safety number be at?


[20-Feb-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	You said it's low, what's normal?


[20-Feb-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Probably 60-70% would be better


[20-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Although realistically the population could be sustained if the +20% happiness program was run instead


[20-Feb-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	Is there anything that we can do, as site owners, to improve that? Or is this up to Gov Bobemor?


[20-Feb-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You could donate to the SST. Either DW, OFF, or SUN. But as a newer player, it's probably best to let the governor handle it.

[20-Feb-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	I need 239 more workers and there will be 0.


[20-Feb-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You are likely to get some pioneers, maybe even fill out those 200


[20-Feb-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Since others will have 25% of their workforce redistributed


[20-Feb-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	I tried to play there and all my windows had horizontal scroll bars and giant text that was unusable.


[20-Feb-23 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	That would bring in a lot more players I think.


[20-Feb-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Just use a real browser


[20-Feb-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	Yeah I play in Firefox and it's great. But I do prefer Steam for gaming generally and if it worked perfectly there I would probably prefer it


[20-Feb-23 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	Just to reiterate what I'd said a few days ago FESIII has been queued up for a few days and will hit so the PIO happiness will be around 90%


[21-Feb-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Festivities aren't going to prevent safety from capping higher tiers


[21-Feb-23 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	Thank you for addressing the Pioneer shortage, Bobemor :).


[21-Feb-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	It's not capping it substantially, this is partly because the ARTs have been somewhat over filled, but yes we would  likely benefit from an additional SST


[21-Feb-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If the ART was overfilled the we wouldn't have unhappy techs/engineers when unemployment for them is zero and the unfilled jobs keep piling up

**melon164**:	FESIII will bump TEC/ENG happiness by 20% too


[21-Feb-23 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	Yes it is


[21-Feb-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	So we should get TEC/ENG happiness of 75% this week


[21-Feb-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Yep


[21-Feb-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	Woot :)


[21-Feb-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	And SET happiness should only go to 60%, so no unneeded immigration there


[21-Feb-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Scientists may get close but think they'll likely be just shy of 75%


[21-Feb-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If we kept the workers happy through upkeep the we could do an immigration or education program instead

**jelutz77**:	Wow that's a lot of migrants


[22-Feb-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	Engineers had a 70%+ happiness but didn't receive any migration.


[22-Feb-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	How does that work?


[22-Feb-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Tech, Engineer and Scientist don't immigrate in, they only educate up from previous tiers


[22-Feb-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Without an immigration program, at least


[22-Feb-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	Makes sense, but technicians do seem to have migration in though?


[22-Feb-23 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	And last migration thing was engineer-related, right?


[22-Feb-23 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	yup, TECs are the highest tier that can immigrate


[22-Feb-23 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rannepear**:	@Yarhor, the migration of ENG last time was due to a program the Gov can run (all tiers can run this program) but they do not naturally migrate based on happiness like PIO/SET/TEC do.


[22-Feb-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	How is the size of the migration governed?


[22-Feb-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Based on happiness of the specific tier. Anything over 70% happiness boosts migration up to a maximum of 30% total population (at 100% happiness)


[22-Feb-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yarhor**:	Linear scaling?


[22-Feb-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	Yes but happiness is the trickier aspect and is effected by many variables.


[22-Feb-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rannepear**:	But yeah, if I have 100 PIOs and they are 100% happy, 30 will migrate on the next report


[22-Feb-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	That is a lot of PIOs, does look like the FES was actually unneccessary strictly speaking. But ah well, we got lots of Techs which is good

**yngwette**:	by "Pick up 8 / 8 units of Basic Structural Elements" does the tutorial contract mean to use the exchange? or is it provided to me somewhere?


[11-Mar-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	oh i see, i need my production order to finish to advance the contract


[11-Mar-23 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If you are reffering to a faction contract - You need to either produce or buy the desired items


[11-Mar-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Not sure how the tutorial looks these days as it has been revamped since I started


[11-Mar-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	it's step 2 of a contract. so i guess the game will tell me more then

[11-Mar-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Mar-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

**peripheralvision**:	Hey folks, I'm somewhat new to this, but have a functional smelting base up and have balanced my production chain fairly well. I'm thinking to branch out into DW and RAT manufacturing to cut down on my labor cost per unit produced, but looks like I can only product ~11 H2O per day from the rig on Deimos. Question: Does the amount of a resource produced by an extractor building (rig, extractor, collector) relate to the available concentrations of the resource on the planet?


[17-Mar-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	yes it does


[17-Mar-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Gotcha, so it would make sense to have a base on a water-rich world to produce organics, and then just ship them around between bases. Is my understanding correct?


[17-Mar-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Also, thanks for responding!


[17-Mar-23 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	well it depends on what you want to do


[17-Mar-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	for example it makes little sense in expanding if you don't have a base that is bigger than 300


[17-Mar-23 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	also the water rich planets are either far away or just very expensive


[17-Mar-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Ok, that makes sense. I was hoping to do two things: 1, diversify my production chain so I'm not married to the price of AL, and 2, cut down on my labor cost so I get to keep more of those tasty profits from smelting


[17-Mar-23 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	what you could do is procude b-fabs ( BBH, BSE)


[17-Mar-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	what would make sense is to buy the hcp and inc them into c


[17-Mar-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Ah, and just bypass growing HCP entirely.


[17-Mar-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	you could that instead of expanding


[17-Mar-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	since expanding for a new player is expensive


[17-Mar-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Makes a fair amount of sense. My spreadsheet calculations show I *could* do it, but the rig means I'm loosing money on albor costs.


[17-Mar-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	I think I'll go with producing b-parts, that's great advice. Thanks for being so helpful!


[17-Mar-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Step 1: Make incinerator


[17-Mar-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	what i would propose is that you start producing BBH or BSE (and you buy LST)


[17-Mar-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	bbh cost rb 2k it takes2 al and 1 lst (100aic) and 6h in a pp2

[17-Mar-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	gonna stick to pp1 right now, I think. Not ready to start supporting settlers yet, I don't think.


[17-Mar-23 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	the issue with pp1 is that fe is expensive, and your pp2 will prod at 50% without settlers


[17-Mar-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	so you make a lot more profit that way


[17-Mar-23 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Ah, so it will still work without settlers. I thought they were required.

**Gl4ucon**:	nope they take (your workforce / totoal required)


[17-Mar-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	So in theory, since I produce AL, it's cheaper for me to go PP2, but without settlers, and buy in the LST


[17-Mar-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	yes and then asap build a settler hab


[17-Mar-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	but didn't you get 40k


[17-Mar-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Gotcha. Ok! Thanks for all your help, really appreciate the knowledge share :)


[17-Mar-23 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Oh, yea I got 45k as part of the package. Spent most of it getting a self-sufficient extractor (ALO), collector (O), smelter x2 (AL) up and running. Didn't realize the Rig wouldn't produce enough H2O, so I dumped a bunch of cash into that, but I deconstructed it and will reuse the parts in other projects.


[17-Mar-23 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	I have a net positive cashflow by about ~3900 from AL production line, provided it runs at 100%. Which it should according to my spreadsheet lol


[17-Mar-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gl4ucon**:	well the other thing you dont need a collector you overproduce o

[17-Mar-23 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Also true, but that reduces my overhead on smelting, and I just sell the extra O to cover the cost of labor on the Collector. Unless my math is wrong, seems to be paying for itself, and then some.


[17-Mar-23 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	I produces ~14 a day, and I only use ~3.8. So yea, definitely overproducing.

**peripheralvision**:	Question. What's a good second base location after Deimos? I'm very early in the game, so too early to establish, but I find it interesting to start thinking about it and planning for the future. I was thinking Antares II E for Iron and SF production. Alternatively, I could go farming to start producing the basic consumables and reduce my production costs. Not sure which way to go, so I'm looking for some advice.


[02-Apr-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**valdin98**:	Nike to turn your AL into Bfabs is a popular choice


[02-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	So I'm currently turning Aluminum into bfabs here on Deimos. I'm guessing Nike has LST, which makes it a better spot to do it.


[02-Apr-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	That said, i'm mostly focused on L-fabs (LBH's) which requires PE. It's cheap, light, and I just truck it in from ANT.


[02-Apr-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pateirn**:	Yeah, I am just trying to get a little of everything here. I did look at Nike for my second base too. Better to do bfab production somewhere else though?


[02-Apr-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pateirn**:	And max out ore production and smelting here?


[02-Apr-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	I mean, why not both? At least for now, right? You can always tear down your PP2's later and move them to a different base. I'm working on smelter 3 right now, which can easily support 2xPP2's and I'm not even close to running out of space yet.


[02-Apr-23 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nuc_Temeron**:	Be sure to look at the Chamber of Global Commerce bonus for what you should build where. On Deimos it's Metallurgy (smelting AL). On Nike it's Construction (making fabs)


[02-Apr-23 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pateirn**:	Oooh awesome. Thanks for the tip!  And fair game peripheral


[02-Apr-23 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peripheralvision**:	Ah, that's a very good point. I think I can still generate more income by making a few fabs here on Deimos, but will plan to move manufacturing to Nike in the future, then.

**Draca**:	Hello all. Question - Under HQ, I see a line "Efficiency gains: Electronics 5.0%", and would jump to 8.3% if I upgrade my HQ. Where does this type of bonus come from, and can I change it? I started as a metallurgist, and would prefer something more in line with that :)


[03-Apr-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The electronics bonus comes from having your HQ in Antares space. You would need to have a base in a different faction to change your faction bonus.


[03-Apr-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Draca**:	Ah, OK, so it's a faction-level bonus, understood. Thank you! Is this listed somewhere, so I can compare them? I don't remember seeing it during company creation.

**Higgsy**:	What's the shipping rate for 10 t / 10m^3 in AIC from ANT to Nike? The Nike global site owners chat is dead so I figure I'd ask in here.


[11-Apr-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	depends how quickly you need it - yours is small so it can be a tag along to smaller orders, so I'd expect something like 100-300AIC


[11-Apr-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but if you want dedicated, quicker delivery then maybe 1k


[11-Apr-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**pogg**:	is it possible to get more ships in the fleet as a free license player?


[30-Apr-23 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Negative, you need PRO to use the shipyard at all


[30-Apr-23 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And if you revert from PRO you'll only be able to fly 2 ships at a time


[30-Apr-23 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	However, as a free license you'll also be limited to 5 bases which 2 ships can handle.


[30-Apr-23 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Sorry, 5 HQ levels, that's actually 6 permits / bases

[02-May-23 01:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Is there a way to remove orders from queue?


[02-May-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	klick on "details" than cancel


[02-May-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Wow, im a idiot. It was easy hahah


[02-May-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	from the side bar: Base (BS) -> Production -> Details


[02-May-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	There is so much info around here that im just confused. It takes time :D  Thanks a lot


[02-May-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	But i like that the game is "chill" and slow


[02-May-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is why I enjoy it as well... can get classes and work done while still playing


[02-May-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Yeah, im at work right now


[02-May-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	It took me about 3 weeks into the game to realize that I don't have to open up every CX to compare prices. I just open a buffer with CXM and the MAT Ticker and there are all prices on the CXs. :D - there is much to find out in this game and you have time to do so.


[02-May-23 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plus, combat isn't a thing.... so my base doesn't get tea-bagged from obit while I'm away


[02-May-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Yeah, there is no rush


[02-May-23 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I got "illegal command" btw when i try to open a buffer with CXM


[02-May-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	typically... global or help are better channels are only players with bases on Deimos can see this


[02-May-23 01:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	CXM plus a material code such as INS


[02-May-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	type in like "CXM OVE" or "CXM AL"


[02-May-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see, im free user (testing the game first) so its restricted for me


[02-May-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can still make something similar in spreadsheets with FIO API


[02-May-23 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Im sorry about my english btw. Ive 3 languages in my head and its quite difficult at times


[02-May-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I can barely write in one language and your english is great!


[02-May-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thanks :)


[02-May-23 01:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I've maintained my 1 mistake per massage policy for a long while


[02-May-23 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I can understand english waaaaaaaaaaay better that i can write it


[02-May-23 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I mix it with my norwegian all the time


[02-May-23 01:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	I struggle all the time with writing according to the other languages rules I learnd ahead of english when writing, so I very much can relate :D


[02-May-23 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Its good to know im not alone hahah


[02-May-23 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	🤝


[02-May-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Spanish, Norwegian and English is not a good combo in just one head


[02-May-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	still, take the game at your own pace. There is quite a lot going on even when it doesn't seem like it


[02-May-23 01:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Yeah its seems so. Im just reading the handbook at work right now


[02-May-23 01:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	But if ive understood so i need to complete the extractor order to be able to complete the smelter one


[02-May-23 01:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	yeah timing and / or building in buffers in your production correctly is a big part of the game.


[02-May-23 01:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I like it. And what about professions? Are you "stuck" with the profession you choose in the start?


[02-May-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	profession only matter for the first 30-45 days


[02-May-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see, thanks a lot :)


[02-May-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	after that... many players build into different setups


[02-May-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for new players, I always suggest asking as many questions as you can


[02-May-23 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Im trying, but i need to see/read tutorials first to be able to ask hahah


[02-May-23 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	But my extractor and smelter are running so thats it for now. Im just clicking here and there to familiarize myself with the HUD


[02-May-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	staring packages have stuff for ~3 days of production.


[02-May-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	starting(


[02-May-23 02:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so you may want to send a ship out for a couple days worth of consumables and production materials


[02-May-23 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I dont know how to do it. Yet hahah


[02-May-23 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	"Fly" command so destination? Any suggestions?


[02-May-23 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	fly responcibly


[02-May-23 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	basically.. minimum plus a few notches


[02-May-23 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you can sell half your starting fuel for some extra funds if needed


[02-May-23 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	(from both ships)


[02-May-23 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	So i need to see the map, find a notch with the consumable/material i want and send a transponder?


[02-May-23 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	nope


[02-May-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Ok hahah


[02-May-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'll want to send to commodity exchanges (CXs) where players buy and sell goods


[02-May-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the closest CX is Antares 1 jump away which doesn;t take that long


[02-May-23 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I liek to send ships overnight... so I can mess with them in the morning


[02-May-23 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	How long it takes?


[02-May-23 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I understand


[02-May-23 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Btw, any way to change the company name if i want to?


[02-May-23 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they are based in Germany.. and are quite active.


[02-May-23 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	as for the flight time... maybe 6-8 hours


[02-May-23 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Ive not Discord at work, but ill try later


[02-May-23 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	typical flights are ~10 to 14 hours... but Deimos is rather close to the CX


[02-May-23 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	on the left side bar CXL -> Ant CX to checkout the prices


[02-May-23 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	depends on fuel used, how full the ship is, etc.


[02-May-23 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm not sure... could send a message to a dev on the discord to ask


[02-May-23 02:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thanks a lot :)


[02-May-23 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'll be interested in RATs, OVE, DW, and production materials. I'd suggest pricking up some PWOs (luxury good) to boost your worker's efficiency


[02-May-23 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	picking*


[02-May-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can check to see how many your guys would use in the Workforce tab (in the base screen)


[02-May-23 02:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thanks zero


[02-May-23 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this map is very helpful: http://prosperous.freecluster.eu/?i=1


[02-May-23 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the Antare's region is in the lower right in Red


[02-May-23 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Ill save it into favs haha


[02-May-23 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you can design and test fly ships in the blueprint screen. (new buffer) BLU


[02-May-23 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	in case you wanted to check the distance between things


[02-May-23 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	This is nice to know, thanks


[02-May-23 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just take your time with everything and ask question xD


[02-May-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Yeah i need time. Its A LOT of info


[02-May-23 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	lots of really nice and helpful players out there


[02-May-23 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	because... everyone started that way xD


[02-May-23 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Everyone was confused xD


[02-May-23 02:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it's a lot of info... and mistake will happen


[02-May-23 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	:(


[02-May-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	players are allowed to restart fairly often.. because starting areas/professions may not be in demand


[02-May-23 02:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see, i hope isnt my case


[02-May-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sometimes starting metallurgy on Montem or fuel on Katoa aren't great option


[02-May-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	AL and ALO are quite in demand atm


[02-May-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'll get a good price for those


[02-May-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I started with metallurgy tho


[02-May-23 02:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	which is fine


[02-May-23 02:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Deimos has a lot of ALO to extrat and smelt for profit


[02-May-23 02:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Metallurgy used to be a 'dead profession' some months ago, one of the hardest starts possible :) It's a living market.


[02-May-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Now though you can not shovel enough ALO into the AL pit to fill it up the gaping canyon though


[02-May-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well.. the FEO/FE market is still quite rough in Moria


[02-May-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Living markets are gold in videogames cause you need to adapt all the time. There is no solution


[02-May-23 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	The game feels great on touchscreen btw, but i dont find the way to move the windows


[02-May-23 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	markets drive a lot of players choices


[02-May-23 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Which is nice


[02-May-23 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most MMO economies die horribly to imbalance or bugs


[02-May-23 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Yeah, i do remember New World...


[02-May-23 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	however, I haven;t seen either in my time here


[02-May-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Is there a goal btw? Apart to grow up your company. And if you have a competitor or something. Politics?


[02-May-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	only the goals you set yourself


[02-May-23 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this is a sandbox. Find something you like or want to do and pursue it


[02-May-23 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thanks :)


[02-May-23 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	looking through the various categories on the market can help with ideas


[02-May-23 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	some want to become very rich, some build ships, some want to develop their own regions in space ... you can go nuts or just be content with producing something you like.


[02-May-23 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see. Is there something to discover tho? Or is the map "completed"?


[02-May-23 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	info about planets is 'known" but that doesn't stop players settling far off planets or regions


[02-May-23 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	planets get developed for different reasons


[02-May-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I mean... I just settled a rather barren rock to make faster-then-light (FTL) fuel


[02-May-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Good luck then :D


[02-May-23 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	placed it ~12 days ago.. Just got back around to it and picked up 5.3k FTL fuel


[02-May-23 03:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Idk if its much or not hahah


[02-May-23 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so it'll do just fine. 5,300 FTL fuel is a decent amount


[02-May-23 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see


[02-May-23 03:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can check it's price on the CX


[02-May-23 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Im waiting for my smelter so ill go into the next step with the tutorial. I think its better to do things slowly at the beginning to understand.


[02-May-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I dont want to rush


[02-May-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yup, just follow the tutorial. Afterwards, checkout the local CX... prices.. surrounding planets... get a feel for it


[02-May-23 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the wiki has a lot of info and tools that can help as well


[02-May-23 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	it is for sure. The thing most players fail at in my opinion ist that they want to expand to fast in this game and then run into liquidity problems and have to restart or find someone to bail them out. So going slowly is a good strategy in the beginning until you have a good feeling for the game.


[02-May-23 03:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Yeah because i dont know how the things work so im just following the tutorial although that means to need more time to do all i need to do


[02-May-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just have fun with it. With multiple bases, ships, and things happening, player can get busy quick xD


[02-May-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I can imagine hahah


[02-May-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sometimes it's not about the profit.. sometimes it's about logistics or self-sufficiency


[02-May-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I work as "Finance Officer", so i can tell


[02-May-23 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	once you're around a while... you'll notice players forget to pack a few trusses or pre-fabs... which costs them a lot to fix a packing error xD


[02-May-23 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	The most important thing is not to lose money. 0 profit are way better


[02-May-23 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	breaking even is not a bad as some make it out to be


[02-May-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Not at all


[02-May-23 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I trade between different CXs... each region has a different thing going on


[02-May-23 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	What trusses and pre-fabs are? In game i mean


[02-May-23 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	building materials


[02-May-23 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	look under construction prefabs on the CX


[02-May-23 03:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or construction materials on the CX


[02-May-23 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	to build or repair buildings... it takes those types of goods


[02-May-23 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see, so its great to have some in the ships before they fly away tho?


[02-May-23 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well... it can help to double check important items before sending a ship


[02-May-23 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	since it costs fuel, time, and repairs to send a ship.... so being short a bit of concrete can be a pain


[02-May-23 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see, my problem right now it not to know what is important or not xD


[02-May-23 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	in your case... just production materials and consumables


[02-May-23 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	maybe pre-fabs if you wanted another building


[02-May-23 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can click on material or building icons to see what recipes they go into or can produce


[02-May-23 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I will learn more about it when im finished with tutorials im sure xD

[02-May-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Clout**:	how long does it generally take to get new ships?


[02-May-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Clout**:	it seems like the cost to entry is exceedingly high


[02-May-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You won't be able to afford a new ship until mid game at least, but you won't really need it before then. Upgrades are much cheaper and can increase your shipping capacity significantly


[02-May-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Depends on the ship you're after, but 0,5 mill for the cheapest models and then all the way up to 5 mill if you want something silly with all the bling


[02-May-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Clout**:	ahh i didnt know you could upgrade


[02-May-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Clout**:	very nice thanks


[02-May-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	You need active PRO to use the shipyard though


[02-May-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And also active PRO to fly more than 2 ships at once


[02-May-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	2 standard ships will keep 6 bases running on free license depending on input/output needs though.

**Kiuhek**:	What do you recommend to construct after the extractor and smelter?


[03-May-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	more of the same? ^^ Depends on what you want to do...


[03-May-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Im not sure, but i do want to be a little independent. I see i cant extract/create carbon and oxigen


[03-May-23 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	But can tho extract more ALO to create AL and sell it to profit and buy those


[03-May-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	At the beginning you are never independent, even as a Victualler you are only a bit more independent.


[03-May-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see hahaha


[03-May-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	You can of course build other bases and become less dependent. You can of course build a collector for Oxygen here, but producing Oxygen is more efficient on other planets.


[03-May-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	You have to decide If you want to be a bit less profitable and be probably more independent in the beginning.


[03-May-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I dont think im ready for a second base


[03-May-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I don't know... Deimos has quite a good amount of O within the region


[03-May-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Severine**:	extractors are good money but they cap out your shipping pretty early


[03-May-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	Yeah at the beginning you also will not have enough money to build a second base.


[03-May-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I do think i need to focus in one ting, but do it well


[03-May-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Severine**:	if you are planning towards a 500 land base, a 1 COL 4 EXT 8 SME, 4 PP2 base is what im aiming towards at the moment


[03-May-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I will maybe go for a collector first and then we will see


[03-May-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I just want to dont need to buy O/C/OVE/RAT every time, but to maybe collect O myself and sell ALO/AL to buy the rest


[03-May-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	You will need to buy C / RAT / DW / OVE for quite a while.


[03-May-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Yeah i know


[03-May-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	But if i collect O by myself...


[03-May-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	yeah do that :)


[03-May-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	O is fine on Deimos.. I have a few extra COLs here for CUO


[03-May-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Im just thinking small hahaha


[03-May-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	as for a BMP for OVE, PWO, etc... or FP for RATs and DW... that depends


[03-May-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Ive a contract which is not good i think, but i just want to "try", as a tutorial


[03-May-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HamletsFather**:	a faction contract?


[03-May-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	learning experinces are good


[03-May-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thats right


[03-May-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	But i want to see how "bad" it is by myself


[03-May-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just think about every 1% repair as 1k credits


[03-May-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you can even name them


[03-May-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Oh yeah, condition


[03-May-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Right?


[03-May-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I've set the fleet window so it's always up


[03-May-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yuo


[03-May-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see. I cannot create the material i need for this so its another thing to think about


[03-May-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	left side bar -> FLT -> click ship


[03-May-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	a hull plate facility (HWP) can be in your future... but it consumes a lot of AL


[03-May-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just depends what you want to get into


[03-May-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Is there a way to see what a collector collects, f.ex?


[03-May-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	COLs, EXT, and RIGs can only extract what a planet has to offer


[03-May-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	COL = gases, EXT = minerals, RIG = Liquid


[03-May-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if a planet has multiple minerals.. you can select what the extract hits


[03-May-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so checking out what is on a planet can be important


[03-May-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Nice to know, thanks!


[03-May-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this site shows the extraction/day at 100% efficiency: https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch


[03-May-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Ive started to collect O now :) Im traveling to Spain tomorrow so i need to have a little plan


[03-May-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	also good for looking around the "neighborhood" for other planets to settle


[03-May-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thanks! Im from Spain tho, but im not living there


[03-May-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	due to planet conditions... sometimes materials like H2O will be a gas or solid... helps to check first


[03-May-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I do need a financials overview tutorial hahah


[03-May-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see!


[03-May-23 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the financials are a bit wonky...


[03-May-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Hahahah


[03-May-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	it assumes everything you make has 0 value until someone agrees it's worth X amount via buy/sell


[03-May-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I see. Im just used to have a prognose and so on


[03-May-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so useing self-produced items... can cause wonkiness.... not inaccurate though


[03-May-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	aside from that... finances does fine


[03-May-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I just need a tutorial to understand everything of that


[03-May-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	financial periods are a week and start on Monday UTC +1


[03-May-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thats nice to know


[03-May-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	So "results" are for this week


[03-May-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Independent? I have 20 bases and am not fully independent. I think the devs did a good job of not allowing that.


[03-May-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	20 bases, jesus


[03-May-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	results are the current week, last week, and the week before


[03-May-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	As i said, i need a tutorial hahaha


[03-May-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so you can track progress over time


[03-May-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I'm not sure I can provide a tutorial for the finance sheets


[03-May-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I can try youtube or something


[03-May-23 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Thanks a lot mate


[03-May-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hope that helped some... I'm not sure anyone fully understands the finance sheets


[03-May-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	Hahahah


[03-May-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kiuhek**:	I just dont want to go bankrupt


[03-May-23 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Just make enough money not to run out of cash :)


[03-May-23 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	I extract ALO from Nascent as well, which frees up space on Deimos, although it's quite rich so there's still plenty of space left over for INC


[28-Jun-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	okay thanks that is very helpful. I think im still going to go to Harmonia first and do FRM and INC there to get started. Then Nascent / Demeter will be the T2 C farm


[28-Jun-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	I was just going to put INCs on Deimos. But, that's my only base right now.


[28-Jun-23 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	same here, but I hit 5 smelters so my queue is gonna be jacked if I add more without more queue slots so I think is 2nd planet time. The space i dont use on deimos for AL will become welding plants and such before I move to HEP


[28-Jun-23 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	If you're only smelting one metal, isn't a single recuring order in the queue enough?


[28-Jun-23 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	i can only queue 5 orders so if i have 6 smelters when they finish one will be left not working unless i manually put it in as they finish every time


[28-Jun-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	A recuring order will start as many orders as its takes to fill capacity.


[28-Jun-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	I just have one recurring order running my 4 SME


[28-Jun-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	oh holy crap man I didn't know I could make them recurring, that totally just changed my whole plan thanks so much


[28-Jun-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	that button is too tiny lol it wasn't until you said that I even noticed it there


[28-Jun-23 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	Ahh, but I just checked. Apparently that's PRO only.


[28-Jun-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	understandable thankfully not a problem for me


[28-Jun-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	One thing to watch out for: a recuring order that can't start will block the top of the queue instead of skipping to the next one.


[28-Jun-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	And maybe regular orders do to, for that matter, tho I haven't encountered that issue myself yet.


[28-Jun-23 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	all my queue just repeat the same thing so I def haven't experienced that, the recurring pretty much puts everything on autopilot now


[28-Jun-23 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	and I'm excited I don't have to wait until HQ 5 for more smelters now :D

[28-Jun-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Queue will skip 1 recipe if 2 slots are open, leaving 1 slot idle, same with 2 recipes and 3 slots open, etc.


[28-Jun-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	If it's all one recipe, it won't matter because if you don't have stuff for one, you don't have it for any.

**FidelCashflow**:	What if I did x5 AL recurring, then a x1 Al recurring? If I don't have enough mats for the 5 per, will it fill it out with single orders until my stuff runs out?


[29-Jun-23 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FidelCashflow**:	like if I have 5 smelters and 17 carbon, will it do 3 x5 orders and 2 x1 or will it just do the 3 x5 and then block


[29-Jun-23 01:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Negative - prodque will go from start until finish, if que #1 fails it will get stuck there


[29-Jun-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	There is no benefit to running larger orders either unless you are looking to balance production between differing items


[29-Jun-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If all your SME's just make AL a single 1x AL on recurring will do the trick.

**Churaviis**:	The benefit to larger orders is that if you don't have recurring production you don't have to requeue production as often, although you'll likely need to build up gradually to larger production sizes in order to build up enough inputs to feed the larger orders

**MithrilGear**:	Does a buy contract on the LM pay out on acceptance, or delivery?


[29-Jun-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MithrilGear**:	or is it manual?


[29-Jun-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It pays out when youre partner decides to pay out, if he decides to

**Yinxx**:	What are those prices for STL and FTL Fuel Lmao


[30-Jun-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**pugstonthepug**:	does anyone have a carbon industry built by chance?


[02-Jul-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	on Deimos.. unlikely but possible. I would think most bring C or agriculture goods to incinerate on base


[02-Jul-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KZ_Kawasaki**:	C is hard to move, so i do make some, but not all here.


[02-Jul-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	im attempting to be self sufficient for my metal industry


[02-Jul-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	so i was looking for advice


[02-Jul-23 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I think 1 farm on Deimos can support 2 INS


[02-Jul-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	INC*


[02-Jul-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	and that would be using the slower C recipes


[02-Jul-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	maybe the other way round due to deimos fertility


[02-Jul-23 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KZ_Kawasaki**:	It's possible to be self sufficient on Deimos, but you won't have space left over for too much more.


[02-Jul-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	im fine for what i want to do on deimos


[02-Jul-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	just need to "automate" aluminium production and ill start another base for other materials


[02-Jul-23 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	just to ask is there any actual automation


[02-Jul-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	using repeat orders.... kind of


[02-Jul-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	when i have a good production setup ill just queue massive orders


[02-Jul-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	anyone have a prefab industry setup


[02-Jul-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	ill send aluminium for cheap


[02-Jul-23 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	100 aic's each


[02-Jul-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most players have their pp2s on Nike


[02-Jul-23 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but I bet there are some with PP2 setups on Deimos


[02-Jul-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	is there any other industries using aluminium?


[02-Jul-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	quite a few


[02-Jul-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	(in a new buffer) MAT AL


[02-Jul-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	shows everything it goes into


[02-Jul-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	or click on the icons for materials/buildings


[02-Jul-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	i see electronic industry, medical industry, alloy industry and exosuit stuff


[02-Jul-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hull plate and welders as well are quire big AL sinks


[02-Jul-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	anyone in deimos have these industries?


[02-Jul-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	quite likely


[02-Jul-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChineseEarthquake**:	probably safe to assume that


[02-Jul-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	do you know anyone who would want aluminum for cheap


[02-Jul-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChineseEarthquake**:	yes, me


[02-Jul-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	sure


[02-Jul-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	how much ya need and when


[02-Jul-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChineseEarthquake**:	I DM'd


[02-Jul-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just know the price of AL at the closest CX is AL.AI1


[02-Jul-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	total production cost of aluminium is maybe 100-200 AIC


[02-Jul-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	seems a bit low


[02-Jul-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ReallyBigWatermelon**:	Hey that's ma' product. I just mine and refine aluminium


[02-Jul-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you sold the ingredients at the CX you'd make more than 100-200


[02-Jul-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Ant CX is just 1 jump away... so selling too low is robbing yourself


[02-Jul-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChineseEarthquake**:	unless you are selling more than 500t and can't transport it all


[02-Jul-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ChineseEarthquake**:	saves on ship wear, fuel


[02-Jul-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	maybe 250 AIC will be my lowest price


[02-Jul-23 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	the trip tot he CX is less than 12 hours... can make multiple trips per day easy


[02-Jul-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	plus, 1 base on deimos isn;t going to make enough AL per day to fill multiple ships


[02-Jul-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	5 experts... full consumables.. it's like on 1k area 200 AL/day


[02-Jul-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	wouldnt having multiple extractors give more production capabilities


[02-Jul-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	extracters take quite a bit of area


[02-Jul-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you team up.. and have 1 base do ore.. and 1 base smelt.. you could be more efficient


[02-Jul-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	dont have someone to team with


[02-Jul-23 04:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	most players don't


[02-Jul-23 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	in the mean time ill sell ALO to get some more materials for more industry


[02-Jul-23 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sounds like a plan


[02-Jul-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	how do you get more ships btw?


[02-Jul-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	they require contractign with a shipyard (PRO) than supplying the needed parts


[02-Jul-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	cheapest ship is ~700k...


[02-Jul-23 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	ships with FTL engines cost ~2m


[02-Jul-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	maybe more... depends on the design


[02-Jul-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	anyways thx for helping


[02-Jul-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you're welcome. Plenty of nice players out there


[02-Jul-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	help channel is usuallly better because more players can see the chat there


[02-Jul-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this is only for people with bases on Deimos


[02-Jul-23 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	also for some reason when i queue AL i get free carbon and oxygen


[02-Jul-23 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	those are the products that go into making AL


[02-Jul-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you might want to consider the recipe that takes FLX... much better overall


[02-Jul-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	but i just wonder why they just appear in my base inv


[02-Jul-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	didnt buy them


[02-Jul-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	likely starting resources


[02-Jul-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	didnt produce them


[02-Jul-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	they just appear


[02-Jul-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	well only my first orders of aluminium had free oxygen and carbon


[02-Jul-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	they were not in my inv when i started out


[02-Jul-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Metal Maker Mountain is Working on a Carbon manufacturing.


[02-Jul-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	I also have a prefab industry started up. Running two MK1 and 1 MK2 as of currently. Dm your business if you want.


[02-Jul-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	since i cant sell directly to people, if you want cheap aluminium post an ad in deimos local market


[02-Jul-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can't access LM ads either @pugstonthepug


[02-Jul-23 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	i guess ill buy pro license soon then


[02-Jul-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll be your loyal customer if you do :D


[02-Jul-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Same


[02-Jul-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	thx


[02-Jul-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	in fact I need like 4000+ units of aluminium per week


[02-Jul-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	no shortage of demand for AL


[02-Jul-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep, agreed :)


[02-Jul-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	id need roughly like 7-8 extractors just for the raw ore


[02-Jul-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I've been transporting AL from Ant CX to Ben CX... so it gets around


[02-Jul-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I set this core module up just in case I have an aluminium emergency (where the CX prices rise too high AL.NC1


[02-Jul-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah.. I'm looking to send AL to Moria soon... Lowstrife has enough money to burn xD


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm doing the same


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	my operations are based there


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and I need to feed my hungry HWPs


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	got 7 of them


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(5 on vallis)


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	those are hungry buildings


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	wow


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and 6 Welding plants


[02-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	an order of 1400 ALO takes roughly six days to comlpete with only one extractor


[02-Jul-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	seems a bit too fast for a newer player


[02-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	one thing i find is a bottleneck is the smelters


[02-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is about 10 AL/hour


[02-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Oh forgot to mention: I'd be willing to throw VC money at any player willing to sell aluminium to me (99 day interest free loans)


[02-Jul-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	well... Deimos is almost out of plots


[02-Jul-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	so I bet there are a couple interested parties


[02-Jul-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hence me putting a CM here xd


[02-Jul-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Deimos is a grerat planet... 80% max ALO deposit 1 jump from the CX


[02-Jul-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	with goodoxygen


[02-Jul-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	i need a lot of oxygen and carbon to start smelting properly


[02-Jul-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	for every 4 extractors i get i need like 8-9 smelters


[02-Jul-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah


[02-Jul-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	smelters are quite inefficient


[02-Jul-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	in reality you could use arc smelters


[02-Jul-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	they can be


[02-Jul-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when they are the only building that can smelt the stuff... they are both the most and least efficient xD


[02-Jul-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	an arc smelter needs no oxygen or carbon dioxide


[02-Jul-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I can partially offload the smelting load onto my base if you're willing to sell the ore along with your processed aluminium


[02-Jul-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this universe doesn;t have electrolysis for H2O, O, and H


[02-Jul-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	it has literal ftl engines thought


[02-Jul-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	exactly


[02-Jul-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	though*


[02-Jul-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	actually can't I just extract ore myself, that'd be more simpler


[02-Jul-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	do you have enough space for it though?


[02-Jul-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	run ALO from aceland to smelt on Deimos?


[02-Jul-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well that's another option


[02-Jul-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	should i dismantle my smelter for more extractors in the beginning?


[02-Jul-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmmm interesting


[02-Jul-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	might have to run the numbers on the smelters


[02-Jul-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I have considered it myself


[02-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	just... ALO deposite on Deimos is soo high xD


[02-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	smelters take like 6 ALO for 3 AL


[02-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	4 AL with FLX


[02-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep extractors make more money by themselves


[02-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	but still thats another ingredient to manage


[02-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(given current prices)


[02-Jul-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@pugstonthepug the difference between FLX and no FLX is massive


[02-Jul-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	could go QJ-149c for ALO... larger deposit there


[02-Jul-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	even buying FLX still turns a massive product


[02-Jul-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Ant just has soo many good ALO planets


[02-Jul-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah agreed


[02-Jul-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I want to get a CLR... but I'm picky xD


[02-Jul-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	I want to use AL for SI


[02-Jul-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	because it is more efficient with C


[02-Jul-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah


[02-Jul-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	tough choices


[02-Jul-23 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	NFI would be a good thing to make with the CLR though


[02-Jul-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	too little demand

[03-Jul-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	just wondering should i set up a base at the gold planet


[03-Jul-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	as your 2nd base? hell no


[03-Jul-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	hmm why??


[03-Jul-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well as always, "it depends"


[03-Jul-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you feel like tackling the logistics of gold, feel freee


[03-Jul-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	because i notice in exchange there is a lack of supply but large amounts of demand

**Gilith**:	check what AU is used for. basically, electronics only. the long complex chains related to drones or ship parts. not something you need at this point


[03-Jul-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	ok thx


[03-Jul-23 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	they just want to sell the gold by themselves xd


[03-Jul-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	well, if you intend to sell the ore, then maybe. but just ore - gold is heavy, you don't want to transport AU


[03-Jul-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	also to ask should i invest in building fuel industry or not?


[03-Jul-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I have my own REF chugging away in the background at Danakil to provide for my own consumption needs


[03-Jul-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	seems quite useful ill do it when i have enough resources


[03-Jul-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I don't think fuel refining stands out amongst the other industries in terms of profit, but good to save on costs


[03-Jul-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	fuel prices are stable, and high in ant space. if you can get the materials then sure, why not


[03-Jul-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	BTW if you decide to start extracting AUO, I'd be happy to buy some


[03-Jul-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	i found my next base location i think


[03-Jul-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	ia-139


[03-Jul-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	it has both aluminium iron and other useful minerals


[03-Jul-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	check the name again, I can't find it. did you mean IA-093b?


[03-Jul-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	it was 039b


[03-Jul-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I got curious as well and was looking around - the FEO and TAI are the primary deposits


[03-Jul-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	o93b*


[03-Jul-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	But that's a non-populated world so you'd need to afford adding infrastructure to make a base happen there


[03-Jul-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	ALO is there, but only trace amounts, not worth extracting


[03-Jul-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	but iron is my next target for minerals


[03-Jul-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	for iron, I'd chose Vulcan. here, in Deimos system


[03-Jul-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	cool


[03-Jul-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	any places for setting up fuel industry here in deimos


[03-Jul-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	this system*


[03-Jul-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Building infrastructure is something you can have fun with once you have some millions and nowhere to spend them anymore


[03-Jul-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Early game it's best to work with what gets you biggest bang for buck


[03-Jul-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	for fuel - Hermes maybe. no idea, I buy my fuel in Ben space


[03-Jul-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	is it cheaper there?


[03-Jul-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	but unless you get a big loan, I'd avoid planets with environment values outside of green


[03-Jul-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	cheap? Hermes is a gas giant, you'll need AEF, so no, it won't be cheap


[03-Jul-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	better than TSH.NC1 HSE.NC1 or tons of INS.NC1


[03-Jul-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	actually it's worse in some cases xd


[03-Jul-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	have you considered Nike? it works great with Deimos as you already have AL, requires SEA but that's not too bad


[03-Jul-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pugstonthepug**:	maybe


[03-Jul-23 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Going to an unpopulated planet isn't bad if you're doing extraction or something. You won't need any infrastructure for a few PIO for EXT and/or SME. However, it's the hostile environment that takes a lot of money to build for; the most expensive thing is high/low gravity, temperature, and pressure. Most of the best planets are the ones that are already settled at this point, though there are a few that have some opportunities at some frontiers.

**RNGzero**:	@pugstonthepug, I have a base on Hermes, it's cheaper than other HE3 taps... that is for sure


[03-Jul-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you'd likely do better getting into SF with NAB than FF


[03-Jul-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	for a AUO planet... I'd reccomend Elon. It has other good resource desposits (MGS & CLI) and is already well established


[03-Jul-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sure it's a couple jumps, but it's quite reasonably close to the CX (does require SEA)

[04-Jul-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	i want to infiltrate the elon cogc and run extraction so auo prices drop


[04-Jul-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You wouldn't need to change the COGC to do that, just build a base and dedicate a high-load ship or two to nothing but carrying AUO back, you'll saturate the market real quick


[04-Jul-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	i don't want to mine AUO though


[04-Jul-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	that is the whole motivation


[04-Jul-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	:)


[04-Jul-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Well there are way more PG producers on the planet than miners so good luck with that


[04-Jul-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	by infiltrate, i don't mean game actions within the current mechanics, i mean planting spies and stuff


[04-Jul-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	blackmail all the chemists


[04-Jul-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	!


[04-Jul-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The chemists have no power in the election, only the corporation owners. Did you think this was a peasant's democracy?


[04-Jul-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	if the chemists don't show up to work, the corporations will be forced to look into other sources of profit


[04-Jul-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If the chemists don't show up to work then they can't eat or breathe. We provide all the essentials for life.


[04-Jul-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	they will be offered sanctuary on zv-307b... provided they work there of course


[04-Jul-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	we will arrange the transportation at our own expense

**jelutz77**:	What do you mean by "dead weight"?


[26-Jul-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SpaceMike**:	Yes, the components don't load for them. "Dead weight" in the sense that they take space/weight but you can't turn them in

**jelutz77**:	Make sure you're in the right place, including whether you're in orbit or landed.


[26-Jul-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	And you won't be able to turn them in if the time to deliver has expired and the shipper hasn't responded to the notice; they have 24 hours to extend the contract to allow delivery or call breach, which would let you have the goods.


[26-Jul-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Or if the contract says "delivery attempted", tell the shipper so they can release space and you can deliver.

[29-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	this is a slow(er) game.. best played on the back burner


[29-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes, those are in real-time


[29-Jul-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	yeah i understand but i thought there might be something else to do as a new player


[29-Jul-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	i'm looking at a contract i have and it says i have to pick up water and everything ... not sure how? or is this only after completing my first production order?


[29-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	faction contracts are optional


[29-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	have you gone through the tutorial videos?


[29-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	no i hoped to avoid this i'm not much of a video-watching person


[29-Jul-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	all good!

**otakakot**:	yeah i'm at "base upkeep" but i think it'll be only relevant a bit later after i produced a few things


[29-Jul-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	so now i should queue some orders, close the tab, come back in 4 hours correct?


[29-Jul-23 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that depends


[29-Jul-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Deimos is within the Antares region with the Antares CX beign the closest market


[29-Jul-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that is where you'll buy and sell materials and consumables to run your peration


[29-Jul-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you may want to checkout prices at the CX.. as well as what Deimos is good at producing (hint: AL)


[29-Jul-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	oh nice


[29-Jul-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	operation*


[29-Jul-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	general chat and help channels are really helpful for questions as well


[29-Jul-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	i'll need a different building to produce AL tho, so i'll look up what that needs, and try to get it


[29-Jul-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	which starting profession did you pickup?


[29-Jul-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	constructor i think


[29-Jul-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	hmmm


[29-Jul-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	you started with a BMP (very good) and a PP1 (not great around Antares)


[29-Jul-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	that's what the window said :)


[29-Jul-23 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	Antares is AL based... while PP1s mainly use FE (iron)


[29-Jul-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	however... making PE in the BMP to turn into BDEs (PP1) can take you a long way


[29-Jul-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	so i should buy some H and C?


[29-Jul-23 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	checkout the recipes you building can make (click their icons)


[29-Jul-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	yeah H and C are needed for PE


[29-Jul-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	some FE can be bought as well... depends if it is profitable to process (likely is)


[29-Jul-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	i need to keep my BMP busy too


[29-Jul-23 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	aside from the basic needs PWO (luxury good) are very worthwhile


[29-Jul-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	BMPs can make some basic consumables.. its a very flexable building


[29-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	when flying ships... most players keep fuel to a minimum (plus a few notches).. and fly overnight


[29-Jul-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	depends on the flight... but Deimos is very close to the CX


[29-Jul-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	thank you for all these tips


[29-Jul-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can sell 1/2 your starting fuel for some extra funds as well


[29-Jul-23 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if you want to start planning things...https://prunplanner.org/login


[29-Jul-23 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	that helps sort things out


[29-Jul-23 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	so it's the kind of a game to play half an hour a day right?


[29-Jul-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yes... once you hae 2 bases... things pickup quick


[29-Jul-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	is there any way to see the projected upkeep of my base to know what's due to run out?


[29-Jul-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	left side bar BS -> view base -> workforce


[29-Jul-23 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Aug-23 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	That's if it doesn't slow, which it surely will


[09-Aug-23 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Wow, that's not migration out though, that's all education to SET


[09-Aug-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Yes, will need more PIO happiness soon, to bring up the 4 week happiness over 75% so we can get more PIO to replace those educated to SET for emmigration, so that we can continue to educate ENG.


[09-Aug-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	BUT, we're losing ENG... why?


[09-Aug-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	because none of the important PI is stocked?


[09-Aug-23 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	So... why?


[09-Aug-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Deimos has very low taxes, it's generally relied on contributions from others as Bobemor just handles some parts


[09-Aug-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	When I was governor, I had money I didn't know what to do with, when taxes were at mandatory minimum. We weren't funding TEC/ENG back then, but apparently aren't now either.


[09-Aug-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	well feel free to run then :)


[09-Aug-23 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Aug-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	still don't understand how the negative workers work


[09-Aug-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	since I have full pop


[09-Aug-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Negative workers?


[09-Aug-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	we're missing at least 247 ENG


[09-Aug-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	which means someone lost them


[09-Aug-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	What do you mean by missing?


[09-Aug-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	We have 200 open jobs, and lost 47 from the planet last POPR


[09-Aug-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	We're currently 200 short on planet


[09-Aug-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	right, so someone lost ENG that they had


[09-Aug-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I don't understand the process in determining who loses them


[09-Aug-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	since I'm still full


[09-Aug-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and I have about 5% of the total ENG pop, so I would've expected to lose at least 1


[09-Aug-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	if it was round robin or something


[09-Aug-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Someone lost 47 last POPR. It was spread among ENG employers.


[09-Aug-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	spread unevenly though, is my point


[09-Aug-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	IIRC, it's round robin, so the losses are probably spread among the largest employers first.


[09-Aug-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	hmmm maybe I don't understand "round robin" then, I thought it would take 1 from each


[09-Aug-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but yeah, that makes sense, largest employers first, all boats sinking at the same speed as it were


[09-Aug-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	And the most able to afford funding POPI get hit first


[09-Aug-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	I think that change came about in response to redistribution taking everybody's employees when a big player drops a huge base in a small population base.

[09-Aug-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	I just started this planet, it has a 10% buffer, and ive only build 4 BMPs


[09-Aug-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and yet, it says the population is 256 + 200 unemployed


[09-Aug-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	4x BMPs should only be 400 population


[09-Aug-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	open jobs are calculated before the report is done


[09-Aug-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	No shit?


[09-Aug-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	i did not know that


[09-Aug-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so it says, you had 200 missing jobs, then it calculates the 56


[09-Aug-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I take it all back thenm


[09-Aug-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so you should still be missing 133


[09-Aug-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	144


[09-Aug-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	next report will say open is 144


[09-Aug-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	fair enough. Then I wonder what the 10% is


[09-Aug-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I think it was some system where they would have it automatically try to get you to a 10% buffer?


[09-Aug-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	but it doesn't work, or wasn't realized


[09-Aug-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	idk


[09-Aug-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	10% workforce pool is for changes between POPR. POPR is the final distribution.


[09-Aug-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	I was also unaware of the timing of open jobs.


[09-Aug-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	yes, it's very confusing


[09-Aug-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	so when open says 200 and then they added 200 that report, it means no one is missing anything!


[09-Aug-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The 10% worker pool refers to the percentage of unemployed workers you can hire immediately upon constructing of production/housing but before the next POPR. The exact number can be seen in parentheses next to the number of required workers for a building on the construction buffer. The default 10% can be changed by the governor.


[09-Aug-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	can we? I don't think you can change it


[09-Aug-23 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	it disappears when I go into rules edit mode


[09-Aug-23 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	POPR rows are sorted terribly (I've suggested devs change the ordering to make it infinitely more intuitive in past)


[09-Aug-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	But we have about 6,000 unemployed Pioneers, which considering new bases add 200 each time on top of this doesn't look highly concerning to me. It's getting close though


[09-Aug-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Settelers we're drowning in, wish I could cull 5,000 but unfortunately not an option. Tech demand is unstable as ever and seems to be at a bit of a high currently with ~250 unemployed currently, which is a little close.


[09-Aug-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Engineers is currently on a demand of 247. Which isn't good as it's a ~10% demand, but that will only be being felt by the top engineer demands so is a very small handful of players.


[09-Aug-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Scientists don't matter as there's only 1 building on the whole planet using them and it mostly just oscilates around that demand long term


[09-Aug-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I have been easing off quite substantially on the POPI inputs largely as other players have been covering much of this, but also because Deimos is in debt (-350,186) but has been improving on that steadily. The player base expansion has increased COGC costs but not increased tax revenue much, especially as COGC inputs feel effect on inflation.


[09-Aug-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	All in all though the POPI situation looks like nothing a 10% festivitiy won't fix, or won't fix in two weeks. So that's what i'm queuing up :)


[09-Aug-23 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	You could increase taxes a bit if it's an issue, especially on the higher tier pops.  That wouldn't effect new players and they are very low at the moment


[09-Aug-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	That is a very fair suggestion. I would like to get people's opinion on raising ENG taxes as ultimately that is where 90% of POPI expenses go to support


[09-Aug-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	I would definitely support that


[09-Aug-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	But then I don't have any ENG ;)


[09-Aug-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(Majority of Deimos' expenses are COGC related though still)


[09-Aug-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	I'd also be fully behind putting SET taxes up to 15 or 20.  That's common on most of the other planets I have bases on


[09-Aug-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	SET ain't costing us anything so that seems unfair


[09-Aug-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Maybe we could charge Settlers users for the inconvenicene caused by their unemployed colleagues roaming the deserts of deimos...


[09-Aug-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	You did just say most of the costs are CoGC, and everyone contributes to that cost


[09-Aug-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I'm not against an increase in TEC and ENG


[09-Aug-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	What do you mean "COGC inputs feel effect on inflation"?


[09-Aug-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I should have said "COGC inputs feel affect of inflation"


[09-Aug-23 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DiggingLake**:	If you are looking at taxes, raise the higher tier ones first: anyone running higher tier pops can probably easily afford even a big jump, and it is worth it for them to pay higher taxes if they can run their buildings at higher efficiency (since the buildings cost so much).


[09-Aug-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	COGC inputs aren't experiencing any inflation, quite the opposite actually. MCG, PE and DW have all gone down in price in recent months while RAT has remained flat other than a brief dip.


[09-Aug-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	You are correct actually. Prices seem to have been lowering on RAT and DW consistently in recent weeks. That's good news!


[09-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**muzamundi**:	i'm new here, any advice on making money around deimos?

**muzamundi**:	also any advice is welcome


[09-Aug-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Make AL and sell it


[09-Aug-23 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	in other words, this planet is set up for folks who are in the buisness of mining AL get better perks. You'll definitly grow fast.


[09-Aug-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	good to hear then, cause that's what i'm doing atm after i finish making the FE i started with


[09-Aug-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	should i make the FE into STL?


[09-Aug-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Yes, thats a 50% more profits. But remember, the economy needs FE and STL.  The prices will differ over time.


[09-Aug-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	can always set up for C or other supplies for smelting AL.. quite a few buyers for that stuff


[09-Aug-23 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i think for now i'll stick with AL since i can get that quite easy


[09-Aug-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Triqueon**:	Just an FYI: If at any time you get a Pro License and thus access to the local markets, consider shipping some of your AL output to Nike instead of the CX. Nike uses tons of it, and you can get cheap LS for the return trip to make FLX out of


[10-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Shools23**:	I"m trying to get traction with AL but early game seems pretty slow going. is this normal? am I missing something?


[12-Aug-23 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shools23**:	any tips for a new guy trying to get rolling


[12-Aug-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The early game is really slow. You’ll probably be on your second base by day 40-60. Focus on building up and filling out your current base. It may take some time to get enough money to expand


[12-Aug-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Although with your starting cash you can buy a building or two


[12-Aug-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Sell most your fuel for starting cash, send you ships slow


[12-Aug-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	Hmmm, I'd rather keep the fuel since you get a bunch of money from contracts at the start


[12-Aug-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	plus at the end (wish i knew this) you get enough building mats to make one resource building

[13-Aug-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Take your time to get a second base, make sure you have settled down, and you have a steady amount of income.


[13-Aug-23 12:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	I personally will not be expanding until i build new ships, and my steady profits are at least 30-40% of the cost to start up my second base, Including, Consumable costs, for the type of Work Force is needed.


[13-Aug-23 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	I'm a construction company, my profits and equity is going to be different compared to other Industries.

[13-Aug-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I expanded as fast as I could myself, with a corp giving long-term payment on supplies / some loans - You can a for a new base every 14 days if you really want to and spend the next month paying all profit into the loans.


[13-Aug-23 03:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	But if you're focusing on playing free maybe 3 months until 2nd base - Depending on profitable your setup gets, ofc - Then could possibly really push to get another 3 bases in the following 3-4 months.


[13-Aug-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	While not impossible, you could have your 6 permits and HQ level 5 set up in under a year of gametime even playing decently casually


[13-Aug-23 03:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	It would still demand a fair bit of activity I think.

[13-Aug-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	the contracts can be turned off, maybe you did this accidentally?


[13-Aug-23 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	in the "fa ai" buffer, at the very bottom, make sure the "receive contract offers" is turned on

**otakakot**:	how much would a different planet be better than a starting one? like is it reasonable to go look for something with more resources / less people, or the difference is not that big?


[13-Aug-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	it depends on what you want to do there. e.g there's nothing better than Deimos for AL smelting. but if you're doing construction, Nike is better


[13-Aug-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	rule of thumb: look for matching COGC


[13-Aug-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	and don't rush it - wait until you run out of space on your starting planet, or close


[13-Aug-23 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	i want to go to some kind of a less-explored planet but i want to manage my expectations


[13-Aug-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	well, at the beginning it's best to stick to planets already settled. when you know the game better, you may consider settling a new one, but it's a big investment. and at this stage of the universe, most of the good planets are settled anyway


[13-Aug-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**otakakot**:	yeah i guess so


[13-Aug-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	The tutorial is really good if you work through it.  The game is relatively slow, that is a big part of its appeal to most of us.  Don’t be afraid to ask questions, but you will likely get faster answers in global chat than on the planet specific channel because there are more people there.  And welcome!!

[23-Aug-23 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	because a lot of players buy C instead of producing it


[23-Aug-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i wanna make it but i need money for that and since i make metals i need C


[23-Aug-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gilith**:	@kindling is an expert on C. out of single-input recipes, I prefer MAI over GRN


[24-Aug-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	I haven't looked much at the different recipes for a long time now. I only run the fast GRN/MAI/HCP recipe, b.c my calculations at the time (over 6 months ago) pointed to more total profits/day doing that rather than trying to minimize cost per unit. If you want to produce lots of C that way though, be prepared for quite a lot of hauling


[24-Aug-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	A tool like https://prunplanner.org/ is perfect for doing that kind of playing around and comparing different setups of C production. If you haven't checked that out already, I highly recommend giving it a try!

**Emperyan**:	Thanks!


[24-Aug-23 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The biggest constraint to C production is burnable crops because there are few fertile worlds and farms take up a ton of area so I recommend the MAI recipe as it grows slightly faster and optimizes your farm production. You can always build more incinerators

**muzamundi**:	if the price wasn't so much i would just buy off the market, but since the price is like 600 each i may as well make my own.


[24-Aug-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i understand we're trying to make as much money as we can, but to sell it for that much is just greedy


[24-Aug-23 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	to think it was selling around 400 at one point


[24-Aug-23 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Careful, the carbon market swings up and down as high prices induce more people to make it but by the time they finish setting up their production chain so has everyone else and the price drops until the reverse happens


[25-Aug-23 12:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	@mazamundi It's not quite as simple as "selling at high price is greedy". I could for example sell for substantially lower than the current CX price, but then I would most likely just feed resellers, who buy my wares and then instantly just re-lists it on the market closer to the current market price (that being "what people are prepared to pay for it"). The solution to the price problem is to make sure the supply is increased to match demand.

[25-Aug-23 11:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i see my distain for high prices for C has sparked an interesting convo. while it is right for the sellers to sell C at whatever price they want they can. this is more coming out more of annoyance since it's hard and slow enough for newer corps to grow since it's a basic resource, while in doing so would also decrease the cost for making said goods with C.


[25-Aug-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	so in the end i see it as a win win for all, people keep buying C and not just self produce it, price for the goods who use it will fall and we can have a somewhat face and stable ecosystem for basic goods


[25-Aug-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Duthan**:	I sell C, but I don't make the market. It'd be dumb for me to list it way outside the existing price band.

[25-Aug-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	it's just people who use it will end up making their own C and in the long run that's who make C to sell will suffer


[25-Aug-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	those who make it*


[25-Aug-23 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	plus since this is a planet the focused on making metals, the idea of making a good that is majorly used cost so much just seems so silly to me.


[25-Aug-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	but never the less, in a day or two i won't have to worry about C since i will be making it myself cause of the very high price

[26-Aug-23 04:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kindling**:	@muzamundi That in my opinion is the correct response to seeing very high prices. Make it yourself if it is actually more profitable for you to do so than buying it on the market. It might not be super efficient, but that doesn't really matter until the prices drop, and then you can go back to buying it instead and focusing on what you really want to produce.


[26-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Aug-23 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Aug-23 04:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	so lower taxes on SCI than on ENG? why? not that it matters much with 30 SCI, just looks weird


[28-Aug-23 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@Gilith Yeah does look different but given there's only demand for 20 SCI on the planet and the Engineer demand they really aren't costing a whole lot. It felt fairest to represent that way. If SCI demand explode would need to address but the one person using SCI is costing less than someone wanting 20 ENGs

**jelutz77**:	@muzamundi it may help to change the ore to 1 recipe; you'll get more than 1 qty out of it. Then the smelter can start doing its thing and get you product faster.


[30-Aug-23 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	If you cancel the extraction, you'll get a pro-rated amount back, and you may be able to smelt something right away

[31-Aug-23 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i'll be lucky enough to make 40k a day now i got everything running


[31-Aug-23 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	2 week old player's usually don't mess around with gold at all


[31-Aug-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	true, but i saw how cheap it was to make and sell


[31-Aug-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	if it's profitable.. sure go for it


[31-Aug-23 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	but there may be some reason for that xD


[31-Aug-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	cost me like 8k for the ore and i can sell the gold for a 32k profit


[31-Aug-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	could try listing some as well... could get a bit more (never know)


[31-Aug-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i'll pass on gold for now... it's too heavy, even for my base i had to buy some warehouses


[31-Aug-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah.. AU certainly gets a lot heavier after being refined


[31-Aug-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	could attempt a metal studio to use it


[31-Aug-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	for 40 bars, it's bit less than 800t


[31-Aug-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	nah, not at that point yet, just trying to build up a safe and basic industry with smelters atm


[31-Aug-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	sounds good!


[31-Aug-23 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	just make a bunch of AL and SI


[31-Aug-23 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	maybe once i get bigger ships and more inventory space, i'll go back to gold if it's selling well


[31-Aug-23 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RNGzero**:	yeah... AL has been in-demand for a bit

**ItalKronin**:	I was going to ask if the FLX recipe was good but it appears I was anticipated


[01-Sep-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	FLX.AC1 costs way less than the extra AL.AC1 you get from it, and while the craft time is longer it's only by ~25% whereas AL is worth ~3x as much as FLX

[01-Sep-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Be careful, the AU market is small and you could easily oversaturate it and send prices down if you make too much too quickly

[06-Sep-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you look at the POPR of the past 4 months, other than a someone taking down their base to the tune of 200 engineers, the gov (+ all the other people donating, despite the fact they shouldnt have to)has never provided sufficient upkeep to maintain the ENG pop. But yall keep voting for him, so im not sure why you are surprised

**RiseofFilth**:	Put stupid in, you get stupid out


[06-Sep-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Sorry Bob, but this has gone on a long time now. Your ideology of "governors don't pay for high-tier consumables, so the taxes are cheap" isn't working.


[06-Sep-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Maddenhenge**:	gonna try to get someone else voted in?


[06-Sep-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you all want to see change, a governor that will maintain pop and charge fair taxes to do so, vote for Paris


[06-Sep-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Maddenhenge**:	how much will the taxes go up compared to now for lower end players?


[06-Sep-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you need proof why its a good decision, just look at any popr for the last 4 months. There has never been enough upkeep provided. The planet is carried on the backs of donors.


[06-Sep-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Maddenhenge**:	like, im still just making aluminum to send to market, along with sometimes some extra mat overflow from production lines for aluminum


[06-Sep-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	We have talked in this channel before. The only significant increase will be for techs and up. Pios will likely not see any increase. But I'll let Paris confirm that himself.


[06-Sep-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Anpache**:	What's the proposed fix? What would Paris do differently?


[06-Sep-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	My plan as Governor:


[06-Sep-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	- increase the infrastructure of the SST, INF, PAR & ARC by at least one level, if not two. This I will do on my own account to make the consumables used more effective.


[06-Sep-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	- Spend consumables to build the high-tier POPs, while keeping the low-tier POPs under control.


[06-Sep-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	- Run high-tier POP attraction programs until the problem is sorted out. I plan to not run Festivals unless it's the best option.


[06-Sep-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	- Supply as much of the consumables in-house to keep costs down (currently planned to supply 100% either myself or in-corp)


[06-Sep-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	- Increase taxes to be in-line with other high-POP planets in the area. Somewhere between Nike and Hephaestus.


[06-Sep-23 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Maddenhenge**:	How badly would the taxes increase for the average player? 10%, 20% or something else


[06-Sep-23 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Taxes: PIO would stay the same (supporting new players is important)


[06-Sep-23 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	As I said, taxes for higher POPs would increase to be in-line with other planets of the same size/type. Look to Nike and Hephaestus as examples of well-run planet with fair taxes.


[06-Sep-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	You've got my support, Paris!


[06-Sep-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Anpache**:	Madden, I would be very surprised if you're looking at anything more than a 5-10% net increase, but the general health of the planet's economy can end up more than making up for it long term, especially as you grow.


[06-Sep-23 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Same link as always, also available on the UFO Discord channel


[06-Sep-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Paris is suggesting a rise a tax on Engineers from 70 (this was recently 10) to ~1440. So roughly a 20x increase. Just for easy context.


[06-Sep-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	It is worth noting that currently Deimos has INCREDIBLY low tax rates. It is also worth noting that the profit margins for an ENG building are often higher so a higher tax rate is probably less significant, and a multiplication of a small number may seem higher. But still 20x tax increase for Engineers (maybe not in non-metallurgy industrys) is Paris' suggestion.


[06-Sep-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Ah slight correction Paris would be unable to raise taxes as high as on Heph and Nike as they have wider tax thresholds. He would only be able to raise ENG taxes to 1080. So ~15x. My mistake


[06-Sep-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@Paris_In_Springtime I assume you would, like other OOG run planets, be using the general OOG corporation. As such accounting of Deimos finances would be impossible. But you/OOG would be taking entire financial responsibility for Deimos regardless?


[06-Sep-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It sounds to me like you are pulling those numbers out of thin air


[06-Sep-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	You are welcome to look at the local rules of any planet for comapirsion @Riseoffilth


[06-Sep-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I used the buffers LR ZV-759c, LR ZV-307c, and LR ZV-194a


[06-Sep-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	In reference to claiming what the new tax rate is going to be


[06-Sep-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	First you say you know is going to do 1440. Then suddenly it cant be that


[06-Sep-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Im curious how you know exactly what number hes going to do


[06-Sep-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	To be fair to Bob, I didn't state the numbers directly, and Heph has a rate of 1,440 for non-COGC jobs.


[06-Sep-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	In my opinion, Deimos being a starter planet means there shouldn't be anything limiting new players trying out different constructions (even if they don't align with the COGC).


[06-Sep-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I did make the mistake in assuming Heph and Nike have the same tax threshold as Deimos. But Paris did say he would sat taxes inbetween those two planets, so hence my incorrect assumption.


[06-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So Bob states as definitive fact as a criticism that the number is going to be explicitly Heph's Non-COGC tax rate


[06-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	My suggestion is: PIO 10 / SET 20 / TEC 50 / ENG 450 / SCI 1,000


[06-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	apologies for not stating them outright earlier. It would have prevented this misunderstanding


[06-Sep-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Okay, so taxes substantially lower than Heph and Nike. Fair enough, good to clarify :)


[06-Sep-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	COGC tax on Heph is 450


[06-Sep-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	so its not lower


[06-Sep-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	its exactly the same


[06-Sep-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	(if you follow COGC)


[06-Sep-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Ah is Heph's COGC Manuf? Wasn't aware, my misunderstanding


[06-Sep-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and Nike is only 400


[06-Sep-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	To reiterate, its 450, not 1440 or 1050 or whatever. And every person with engineers in this channel in previous weeks have asked for taxes to be raised if it means getting maxed pop and not sudden drops in workers


[06-Sep-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and nothing has changed


[06-Sep-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The other players who contribute as much as the governor to upkeep have spoken in this channel in previous weeks agreeing that taxes should cover the cost to adequately fund upkeep


[06-Sep-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and nothing has changed


[06-Sep-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I raised the taxes over a week ago in response to that feedback.


[06-Sep-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and immediately lost 100 ENG and a few SCI since then?

***Bobemor** deleted this message.*


[06-Sep-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	at first, all the engineers wanted was to do some metallurgy, but they quickly lost heart when they saw the state mandated massage chairs provided on phobos to all the com sci majors who barely passed freshman physics


[06-Sep-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Due to a sudden an unexpected fall in demand of Engineers, and then a sudden unexpected rise in demand.


[06-Sep-23 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	To be fair, there have been hundreds of open ENG jobs for the past few months. This was only resolved by the parties leaving, not the jobs being filled


[06-Sep-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	5 months


[06-Sep-23 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Look at each infrastructure. SST: The gov donated the majority of it in the past month with some coming from Sardonis. INF: The gov last donated 20 days ago with mats that are still good, and Sardonis donated 1.5 months of TUB. PAR: The Gov has donated a significant amount of DW with Kalleria and Sardonis(mostly the latter) donating 30 days of mats. ART: ONLY SARDONIS has contributed in the last month. UNI: The gov donated 2 items, one of which has expired.


[06-Sep-23 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The result is, if we only looked what the gov has donated: Culture would be zero, which means education would be zero. Comfort would be half of what is is. and Safety would be half of what it is.


[06-Sep-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Relying for months on charity from primarily Sardonis and Kalleria to fill in the gaps, and even then, everything they provide + the gov's contribution do not produce the necessary fullfillment


[06-Sep-23 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And on top of that, Festivals to bouy happiness in a short term scenario, presumably to upgrade infrastructure and make more contributions with cheaper inputs, have only been used recently and at their middle or lowest strength


[06-Sep-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Trying to lowball taxes to guilt other singular other players into bouying up sinking ENG numbers, amoung others, is just bad policy. The governor has had the power for months to act in a way that would generate revenue and provide the necessary upkeep, and it hasnt been done.


[06-Sep-23 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If the current gov will not use the power his position affords him to manage the planet properly, at the very least, break even pop fulfillment or employment,, someone else should be elected.

**Luubstar**:	I think I understand @Bobemor 's dilemma. If you raise taxes, starting businesses here, or maintaining them, would be less beneficial and could harm the planet's economy. Imposing high taxes to try to maintain population statistics would then be useless. At least that's what I think I understand

[06-Sep-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Even high taxes aren't enough to dent high tier production line profits, definitely not any where near as much as lost efficiency to insufficient workers


[06-Sep-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Luubstar**:	Yes, of course, the high tier ones will not be damaged, but a large part of this planet is metallurgy, mainly extracting and processing resources (AL and O mainly). Maybe it's that one who fears harm. In any case, I extract all this from the little I have read.


[06-Sep-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Felmer**:	you can tax primarly the higher pop and let the rest stay low


[06-Sep-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	we've had a sudden influx of people and bob only changed the taxes recently so i do think we're being rash about kicking him out for a person who wants to bump up taxes by a huge amount. i'm only a month old account so i don't have high lvl pops so it hasn't affected me at all.

[06-Sep-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	taxes wouldn't be kicked by a huge amount, or maybe at all, for lower tiers. Taxes would only really increase for higher tier production so that the governor can pay for necessary upkeep. Right now a lot of that necessary upkeep for higher tier production is just being donated by people who need it, which is not fair to those individuals and not how a government on a planet this size should work. So the increases are necessary and would only really impact those that benefit from it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[06-Sep-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	Ultimately yes the vote should come down to: OOG and people with high ENG requirements vs anyone else. If just looking at it as a narrow contest over OOG control and idle engineer populations.


[07-Sep-23 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	@melon164 don't be disingenous, you've voted OOG every time OOG has contested I'm sure ;)


[07-Sep-23 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I didn't complain, no


[07-Sep-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I did notice because my ECAs on Phobos ran dry because they're out of ratio


[07-Sep-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	That's not accurate unless you're suggesting Deimos' POPR is glitched.


[07-Sep-23 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I think there are numerous bug reports indicating that population allocation _is_ glitched, yes


[07-Sep-23 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	which is not your fault, obviously


[07-Sep-23 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I was not fully staffed last week, or the week before


[07-Sep-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Ultimately, yes if you want to pay more (and as an OOG member who will be funding the shortfall pay more on top of that) to attempt to guarantee your full ENG population constantly then you should vote Paris. But you do currently have ~10% of the ENGs on the planet


[07-Sep-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I know, and I've consistently asked for high-tier taxes to be raised every time this conversation comes up


[07-Sep-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I'd rather coordinate with you (and the other small handful of heavy ENG users) to directly support the population you want and engage you in the game mechanics while saving everyone else the cost.


[07-Sep-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I think what it comes down to it, I want an active governor who will "sort it out"


[07-Sep-23 02:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	But i can see the appeal of just throwing money at Paris to do that on your behalf. But I think you can understand why other players might not prefer that if it involves them also throwing some more money (which is unneccessary even if not huge).


[07-Sep-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	if that means being asked to make special donations, sure


[07-Sep-23 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	I've paid for probably a dozen immigration programs on planets where I wanted additional high-tier pop


[07-Sep-23 02:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Are governors expected to fund everything on a planet using the money raised from taxes?


[07-Sep-23 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I'm sure that was the intention, but with inflation constantly hitting consumables hard (due to low supply and high demand), running a planet ends up being voluntary charity. Making consumables yourself and raising taxes to be inline with other planets only offsets that cost.


[07-Sep-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	What I am most impressed with Bob is his meticulous record-keeping that he has always published. It shows that, even with his more hands-off approach (which has been unpopular), running Deimos has still cost him some. Being a governor is not a path to riches.


[07-Sep-23 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I guessed it was an unwritten 'rule' as I've never read anything on what a governor is meant to do. Are these engineers vanishing from bases, or just the workforce pool? Sorry, if this is a stupid question


[07-Sep-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	There aren't enough of them, people are creating new jobs (by putting down new buildings) faster than they're immigrating/educating


[07-Sep-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	They could be made to immigrate/educate faster with different management of the population infrastructure and government programs

[07-Sep-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Basically, PIO & SET can be increased "from thin air" via Migration by keeping that POP's Happiness above 70%. However, higher POPs only grow through "upgrading" via Education. It happens by one step per POPR report and is also tied to that POP's Happiness.

**Wildgardener**:	What makes them happy?


[07-Sep-23 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And yet for 33 of the past 36 cycles, we have been negative one engineers. For all the "One more chance" people, this is not a sudden thing despite how last minute Paris' candidancy is. The problems and ENG deficiencies have lasted for months and we have asked the Governor to fix them for months. We've had discussions in this channel over the last 2 months with every single voice in support for raising taxes immediately to support ENG pop to just fill the existing demand. Paris was going to run last month, but stood back to give one last chance. Chances are over. This POPR and the fact that the governor still relies upon other players to contribute half of this past month's upkeep is the straw that broke this understanding. Final chance over. Time for someone who will do what needs to be done. And remember, taxes will not go up for any PIO users. This is exclusively a change for higher tier workers to support everyone's needs.


[07-Sep-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@wildgardener The planet has buildable infrastructure buildings that you can see via a link on the Planet info screen. Each Infra building has a option of inputs that provide some amount of the 5 types of "fulfillment". Every worker requires all 5, but the lower tiers focus on the easy ones like safety and health. The higher tier workers need the higher tier fulfillments. You must provide inputs for the buildings to function. Taxes collected will pay for these upkeep items so that the infrastructure provides fulfillment, which affects happiness of the workers. We need the happiness or we lose workers and our production slows down.


[07-Sep-23 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	We can discuss back and forth of reasons why ENG pop is chronically undersupplied, why the gov reasons for refusing to provide necessary upkeeps, and the claims of sudden demand for new pop(a factually false statement when looked at over the past month), or whatever, but the facts are the facts. 33 of the past 36 POPRs, the gov has failed to provide necessary ENG workers. Paris will fix it, and those who use these workers will make more profit(even after tax), and those who do not will not be significantly affected. Paris will resolve these issues in a way that doesnt harm new players and increases the stability and profitability for everyone else.

[07-Sep-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Deimos taxation currency will always be AIC as it's a faction planet


[07-Sep-23 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	From Paris' plans presented he/OOG (unclear which) would be investing considerable personal capital each week. Taxes will in no way fund the kind of expensive (and in my view excessive) population supply they wish. Deimos has previously used demand to generate growth. Which has been successful. The degree and boundaries of that success can be queried but its indisputable that Deimos' Engineering population has grown and the cost of doing that has been drastically less than many other planets.


[07-Sep-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I have always taken a long term view on POPI as a mechanic. It is not one that should be measured in days but in months. I can entirely understand the perspective that cash is meaningless to old players so might as well throw money at it. But I'd personally rather Paris just did that and didn't raise taxes


[07-Sep-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	That's great thing about OOG, we don't care about balancing the budget, we care about having enough workers for our high tier production lines. The cost of infrastructure and upkeep pales in comparison to even just a week of reduced efficiency of our high tier lines


[07-Sep-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I mean there's nothing stopping you doing that. Other than wanting to control Deimos :P


[07-Sep-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I think it's worth pointing out that smelting 4 AL on Deimos right now costs $6 AIC of taxes. At CX prices, the inputs are $1300 and the outputs are $2800. $6 of $1500 profit is a 0.4% tax rate. So I think riling people up about tax increases shouldn't be a realistic concern. Even for new players, it's not affecting their bottom line.


[07-Sep-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I mean no one is suggesting raising PIO taxes, (though that would be needed to begin to balance the budget)


[07-Sep-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	(*If the budget is for intense POPI spending)


[07-Sep-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Only the governor controls programs and beyond that we don't want to enable a lazy governor. If we're going to fix Deimos then we might as well have the official mantel and get the taxes too.


[07-Sep-23 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I think it's just nice to have a whole team behind an important planet like Deimos


[07-Sep-23 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I've repeatedly offered (and have) coordinated with people to supply POPI inputs directly, as well as doing target programs when people have expressed a need for that ahead of time.


[07-Sep-23 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I'm not sure it's fair entirely to brand me lazy when you've never taken me up on that frequent offer

[07-Sep-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	Paris won't be doing all the work for Deimos. OOG is saying they will right?


[07-Sep-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

Bob got me started in this game and I'd like to consider a good friend, though this multi-month long issue has surely damaged that, which I regret. He is a great dude. It just that the planet pops were not being handle in a way that was satisfactory to myself and others. I've known Paris almost as long as I've played this game.

[08-Sep-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Those that use ENG & SCI POPs will be required to help fund the expensive consumables that keep those POPs happy. These levels bring the tax rate in-line with other large planets, and is still a massive bargain compared to the value received.


[08-Sep-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Also, you will note there is no gating against types of jobs; new players like to try out various industries and I'm not going to penalize that (usually it's Carbon manufacture here).


[08-Sep-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	That is all.


[08-Sep-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**AndromedaPlusOne**:	Thanks for making sure us new players aren't blocked from trying everything, Paris.


[08-Sep-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Luubstar**:	@Paris_In_Springtime We could try to lower taxes a little at the high levels, to try to compete economically with the other planets in that field. I don't know if you have already taken it into account.


[08-Sep-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	That has always been the policy here, I am just continuing the policy. However, you should know that you are missing out on 25% productivity if you produce in a building that is not aligned to the COGC bonus


[08-Sep-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	(which is Metallurgy here on Deimos)


[08-Sep-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AndromedaPlusOne**:	Good thing my main industry is planned to be Metallurgy. Still want to test everything though. Andromeda Arms and Logistics hopefully will be able to sell the basics necessary for everyone, one day.


[08-Sep-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Luubstar**:	Yes, I know. I was just saying it to try to be more competitive in that sense


[08-Sep-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	@luubstar Don't worry about the dragons that have ENG & SCI workers; they are more concerned about having full working buildings than what the tax rate is.


[08-Sep-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Luubstar**:	Nah. I am not worried. I'm sure they have better knowledge of the game than me. But it is usually a rule to follow in economics in general, "If you want to attract people, increase their profits." If we can reduce your taxes and improve your workers, we achieve both


[08-Sep-23 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Sep-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Bobemor**:	Congratulations Paris! As Paris said we work closely together and hopefully will continue to do so, so I am confident that he will be a good responsible governor. As he says for the vast majority of players (~370/390) they will notice no change whatsover. Paris will be putting in substantial amounts of his own resources and money for Deimos and i hope the players with unfullfilled Engineer demand personally thank him for that :P


[09-Sep-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Bobemor**:	I'll also get in touch with him about transfering over the Deimos treasury which I think is about (1,000,000) AIC ;D

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	NOTES


[20-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	PIOs: All the new bases have stripped the buffer down bare - this is great news! Time to build the buffer back up.


[20-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	SET: Carrying far too much buffer. However, it's near-impossible to bring this buffer down while also building up higher-tier POPs. Will just have to live with these useless eaters for now.


[20-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	TECH: 2nd-highest growth in 3 months, and new Jobs are still outpacing new TECHs! Glad to see all the new industry going up! Expect even higher TECH growth next POPR.


[20-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	ENG: Highest growth in 3 months by 67%, and new Jobs are still outpacing new ENGs! Again, more higher-tier industry is great! Expect the same ENG growth next POPR.


[20-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	SCI: Thank you to the person who told me they were building a singular SCI building this week. I expect you'll have your building filled within 2 POPRs.


[20-Sep-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	THAT IS ALL.

**Re-Creator600**:	HI all, How many corps are here, and do they accept beginners?


[21-Sep-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Quite a few, and yes. Though specifically, the traditional “everyone in under one roof” is not very common due to the mechanics around governors and tax collection. A lot of organizations organize via discord servers and loose collaborative projects. There are some exceptions tho


[21-Sep-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	just a heads up, a lot of groups expect such participants to have PRO, as it is difficult to participate with at least Basic, from a game mechanics pov


[21-Sep-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	without at least Basic*


[21-Sep-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It is not. That being said, some popular non-starter planets have free to join corps that have HQs there, which gives everyone a 10% production bonus


[21-Sep-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	griffonstone or etherwind are good examples of that


[21-Sep-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DeliahCobay**:	Whats the difference between free and basic?


[22-Sep-23 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	basic lets you accept contracts from LM and other players


[22-Sep-23 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	but you only get basic once your sub runs out


[22-Sep-23 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeliahCobay**:	Well, I won't worry about it anymore


[22-Sep-23 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeliahCobay**:	I have fun so far, so I got the pro one for a month


[22-Sep-23 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DeliahCobay**:	On a different note, I'll take a grant if one is offered.


[22-Sep-23 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	"seems sussy to me" - though I can understand skepticism after playing other games like EVE or WoW where scams happen, I'd likely be insulted enough by this comment to retract the incredibly generous offer.


[22-Sep-23 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	This is a slow game, and most people fit it into their lives where they can. Expecting immediate responses from others is unrealistic.

[22-Sep-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	It is possible, but tricky- OOG is the most elite corporation in Antares space. Our governance program now rules most major planets in the region and we are fast approaching one million people under our rule


[22-Sep-23 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Are you on discord? Send me a message there and I can give you some details.


[22-Sep-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Sep-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	We have a lot of programs to help new people get started, loans, our dividend programs, a friendly and very active discord, we offer a lot of guidance for base design, ship construction, and help for new governors. We have discount materials and an internal auction system to distribute them. We have a lot of cooperative production chains and work to ensure priority materials go to corp members first.

[22-Sep-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	what's causing this massive influx of people buying it?


[22-Sep-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gaffy**:	I did, The "Eating just whole aluminium" challenge was a great success


[22-Sep-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Well. Carbon is low, probably from people making it exiting the market and the increase in FRM products


[22-Sep-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Carbon stocks*


[22-Sep-23 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	so AL production cost is up


[22-Sep-23 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and demand for AL is up with B-fabs and L-fabs being basically at upper MM


[22-Sep-23 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Need more FRM, C, and AL producers across the board


[22-Sep-23 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i knew C has gone up and it's the reason why i started to make my own a while back. but now i understand why AL is being used so much that it seems it's more of a good idea now to make your own C then make AL and sell the AL


[22-Sep-23 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i was making SI but no point now. AL is at the point where it sells about the same if i was to make SI


[22-Sep-23 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	or turn the AL into B-fabs


[22-Sep-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Is anyone interested in buying small quantities of AL on the LM? I only ever see ads for over 100. I don't ship as much back to Gibson these days, so it's filling my base here on Deimos


[22-Sep-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	for a reasonable price? always


[22-Sep-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**muzamundi**:	have we ran out of PIO?


[23-Sep-23 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**muzamundi**:	i have room for more PIO to work, but they ain't joining


[23-Sep-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	The unemployment percentile is only 2%, likely due to the vast amount of joiners - but 2% of 205K is still a solid quantity


[23-Sep-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	It's far more likely that you've met your weekly maximum which is marked within () and is some unseen amount based of how many unemployed PIO are around and how many bases exist


[23-Sep-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Pop report was 3 days ago, so any slots you have unfilled should fill up in 4 days


[23-Sep-23 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Realistically, it is a mistake to diversify your industries and experts on a single planet. You stand to make the most profit maxing our maximum SMEs or other smelting industry structures, and then expanding to someplace like Nike for construction


[26-Sep-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Good profit figures largely come from maximum experts and COGC bonuses


[26-Sep-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	PIOs: Slow-down in the rate of new bases noticed. I expect the PIO buffer to at least keep pace with the new buildings.


[27-Sep-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	SET: Still carrying too much SET buffer. Still impossible to avoid while building higher-tier POPs. C'est la vie.


[27-Sep-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	TECH: -55% new Jobs being created. Unemployment doubled since last week. I will be attempting to stabilize Unemployment at around 5-8%.


[27-Sep-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	ENG: No new ENG jobs? I hope everyone who wanted ENG buildings has built them and filled them up. Please let me know if you plan to call on more ENG in the near-future so I can make sure you have the POPs you need. If you don't , well...


[27-Sep-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Wildgardener**:	Does anyone have any MEA to sell? I can't believe how much my lazy SCI eat. Why can't they just eat RAT like everyone else when they run out of food? Only need 2 - can pay 5,500. Will put up a LM ad if there are any offers...


[04-Oct-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-23 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	PIO: With 7,000+ extra PIOs arriving today and looking for work, Deimos has become a beacon of progress!


[04-Oct-23 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	All other POPs are in buffer and reaching the level I would like. We will soon only need to maintain the levels we are at.


[04-Oct-23 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	This will unfortunately make for uninteresting POPR reviews, but I am sure we all prefer full factories without worry.


[04-Oct-23 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Thank you to the player who told me they will be calling upon TECH & ENG soon. I have taken steps to ensure you receive your workers as soon as possible, once you build your factories.

**Noahdor**:	i just got a contract that says that i have to provision 4 raw silk strains at deimos but i have no clue what to do. do i make 4 raw silk strains? do i buy them? and when ive done that what do i do with them?


[08-Oct-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noahdor**:	and if i do have to buy them then where do i buy them?


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Your best option right now is to buy RSI.AI1 at your nearest commodity Exchange, which is ANT (Antares Station Commodity Exchange)  Make sure you have enough AIC to buy 4 RSI which right now would be 1,360 Credits


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	it will take time to send a ship there, so make sure you have enough fuel, and other goods to trade in your ships inventory before you embark.


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	if you have any further questions im here.


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Uhmm, Once you have your needed RSI, you will send your ship back to base, and move the RSI into your base inventory, and then you should be able to complete the contract


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noahdor**:	well i already had a ship there for another contract and i tried to buy rsi but according to the order book nobody is offering rsi


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	aoh


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	yep your correct.


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noahdor**:	so do i then order the materials for an ivp and order the materials to make rsi and then just make the rsi myself?


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	At your level, id recommend letting the contract die, It would be too much for you to travel to farther away Commodity Exchanges.


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Wait for a new set of three contracts to arrive the next day. Make sure they are viable to you before you accept so you dont encounter this same situation.


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	and that my friend is the art of the deal.


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noahdor**:	alright i'll do that, thx.


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noahdor**:	btw at some point i'd like to start building and selling different ship types but how can i get to that point? and did i choose the right profession for that? if not how do i change profession?


[08-Oct-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	I can only tell you from my experience, since i want to follow the same back.  I started on this planet as a construction company and im still persuing that path to build ships.  This planet is fit more for Metallurgy, they have better perks and stuff and those folks grow way faster on this planet compared to other professions.   Early on in the game, you have the freedom to liquididate your company and start a new, or later down the line you can switch professions, just make sure you plan accordingly and you are confident in your desicions and what now.    I liquididated early on because i had no idea what i was reading and i was failing the tutorials and wasting so much money. Once i realised my errors i liquidated and restarted and ive been fine as construction professions. Its just a slow pase, im set on my tracks.


[08-Oct-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Noahdor**:	how do i restart completely?


[08-Oct-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DeliahCobay**:	Is it cheaper to just joink some food here to burn or to buy carbon directly?


[11-Oct-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	That's a big question, and one of the central decisions of the game.


[11-Oct-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	In $$ terms, it's cheaper to make Carbon from food materials.


[11-Oct-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	However, the INC building takes space, and area is a limited resource on every base.


[11-Oct-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	(Also, every building needs housing for the workers, which also takes up more space)


[11-Oct-23 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	If you do that, you won't be benefitting from the +25% production speed from the COGC (Chamber of Global Commerce) - that bonus is to Metallurgy buildings only. So it comes to your preferences, goals and current situation.


[11-Oct-23 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	In my opinion, you will be better off buying Carbon and putting up more SMEs to make ALO->AL. You'll make more units per day, even if every unit of AL is more expensive individually.


[11-Oct-23 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Personally I've been lucky enough to find stable dedicated suppliers of C and been able to buy them constantly which is great considering that C is one of the most logistically intense things to make


[11-Oct-23 04:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	It has been tempting to use some of my free permits to create a couple of bases dedicated to HFY and INC but even at my size it's annoying and cumbersome


[11-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Maybe especially at my size considering I consume over a thousand C daily for metal making purposes


[11-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And metals are already bothersome enough in their own right. AL less so than FE but I'll digress... you can give either a go to establish your own opinion :)


[11-Oct-23 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Either works, both has their own advantages


[11-Oct-23 04:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah. Whenever a large supplier in any market leaves, there is almost an instantaneous market correction due to uncorrectable supply/demand relationships in the short term. It'll take a while for  entrepreneurs to secure liquidity, establish additional bases, and bring such goods to market. So in such cases, I wouldn't worry about what the price actually is, rather how much quantity you can secure for youself in a given week.


[12-Oct-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Buying up bulk during market surpluses will put a roof over your head during times like these.

**Roh**:	My permits are roasted, since I'm very close to the A-fab grind. You should make the financing known in AA or UFO, so that newer players can get more engaged.


[12-Oct-23 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	FYI: The Afab grind starts at permit 17, you're on permit 8. You still have loads of bases before things start getting serious.

**Wildgardener**:	I've been on Deimos 500 days and I've always produced enough RAT and DW to keep my aluminium workers happy, but is there a better agri planet near here that is fertile with H2O?


[16-Oct-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	harmonia is very close, it's a good match with Norwick as FP base too


[16-Oct-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Ice Station Alpha is a good H2O planet, where I suppose the cheapest H2O in the area is sourced; might want to buy it by the shipload if you want to make DW.


[16-Oct-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	H2O is relatively cheap at the moment on the CX, and should stay cheap for a while.


[16-Oct-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	It means you don't have to handle the H2O yourself until you're ready. Instead, you can focus on the more profitable side until then.


[16-Oct-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The Harmonia + Demeter -> Norwick FP is a very nice, highly profitable triangle to do anything food-related.


[16-Oct-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Electronica is also a good source of H2O


[16-Oct-23 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wildgardener**:	Is Harmonia is more fertile than Deimos?


[16-Oct-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	As governor of one of the 3 most fertile planets in the game (Pyrgos), you're gonna be disappointed by the answer:


[16-Oct-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Demeter: -0.4% fertility


[16-Oct-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Harmonia: -3.14% fertility


[16-Oct-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Deimos: -10.3% fertility


[16-Oct-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The benefit of Harmonia is the close proximity to the CX - Demeter is further. Also, both are running AGRI in their COGCs, giving that sweet +25% production speed that we all love so much.


[16-Oct-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Deimos (and Nascent) are the best ALO planets in the game.


[16-Oct-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	This is what the devs gave us to work with. Glory be.


[16-Oct-23 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Nov-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The funnest part for me is finding niche or undersupplied products that I can charge through the nose to get. It's way fun getting the record for the highest price and most gouged nose, or at least as far back as the records go

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	This is a game about logistics; getting stuff from here to there, processed, then taking it over there to process further, again and again until it's either used up or sold to someone else.


[03-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Everything is ultimately either a base or planet consumable, a fab to build or repair buildings, or a ship part.


[03-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Thankfully, it's really complicated, and you can't do everything yourself; you're gonna have to interact with other players somewhere - either buying raw materials you can't mine/farm/make yourself, or consumables you just can't produce yourself. It's all too much.


[03-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Either you diversify heavily (which can be maddening), or you hyper-focus on one or two products that you supply to the CX at a reasonable price so others don't have to mine/farm/make that particular item. Or do what Churaviis said and price-gouge on niche products until they bleed.


[03-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Honestly, you need to figure your own goals out yourself, and find your own endgame.


[03-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	(Personally, becoming the governor of a big planet is quite involved and rewarding, as is the politics at that level. But that's just part of my own personal journey)

**FreshFromage**:	dont feel obliged to follow the crowd and just smelt aluminium like everyone else, have a look at what else could be profitable to produce with your smelter


[13-Nov-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prometheusu**:	is there something that is super profitable?


[13-Nov-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	I've noticed that anything produced by higher tier workers (technicians, engineers, scientists) is more profitable. But those buildings are an expensive investment, and there are often few buyers for those products. Which makes it more risky to invest as well.


[13-Nov-23 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	By the way, compared to real life, everything is super profitable in this game. A 30 day return on investment? That's kind of average in this game, but extremely rare on earth :-)

**roganartu**:	hey, if anyone (newbros included) is interested in joining a group making fabs, we're in need of an AL smelter either on Deimos or Vulcan (next door). All inputs would be provided, and the weekly payout is in lfabs and rfabs (the very same ones you need for HQ upgrades for permits 7 through 17 ;) ). PRO required. Zero-interest loans available if you need it, shoot me a DM in game or on discord (same username) if you're interested :)

**RiseofFilth**:	I'll vouch for Roganartu's offer. We got a great group of guys, with loans available to give newbros and vets up to speed within a week. Waiting 2 months on your first base to expand is dumb. Join up, make some real cash, and get into the meat of the game faster!

[09-Dec-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	You've got to fly a ship to the CX and load it up.


[09-Dec-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	You might want to watch a few of the youtube tutorials


[09-Dec-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Precision**:	will do


[09-Dec-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	If you don't have a warehouse there, the things you bought might have ended up in a contract


[09-Dec-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	you can pick them up out of the contract when a ship gets there


[09-Dec-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	(or rent a warehouse, which is cheap and very useful at the CX)

[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jones-danby**:	:) yes,..100%


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WYATTHY**:	i took me like five days to plot out my plan XD


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jones-danby**:	i think i need the same time but for understand how i build a base....:)


[12-Dec-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jones-danby**:	englisch is not my motherlanguage


[12-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WYATTHY**:	What is?\


[12-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jones-danby**:	german


[12-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WYATTHY**:	Nice


[12-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WYATTHY**:	I dont know any german XD


[12-Dec-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Follow the tutorials and it will get you started pretty well.  One frequently missed step after building your initial base is moving the supplies from your ship into the base.


[12-Dec-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	They are working on a German translation of the game, but I don't think it is live yet.


[12-Dec-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	All of the in game chat channels to my knowledge are in English.  We have a very helpful community that will help with any questions you have (granted mostly in English).


[12-Dec-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WYATTHY**:	Btw if you ever need any help im here i may not be the best but :D


[12-Dec-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	I recommend the global "Help" channel instead of this specific planet channel because there are more people in the Help channel so you will get a faster response.  You can also ask here, it just might take longer to get an answer.


[12-Dec-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WYATTHY**:	That is very true also if you want to join a corp they can be helpful in teaching you the ropes


[12-Dec-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	You should have some starting consumables in one of your bases. If you need more then you'll have to buy it from the CX as free accounts are not allowed to trade directly with other players to prevent multi-account abuse. Follow the tutorial missions and you'll learn how it all works.

[21-Dec-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You can do most things on FREE and still grow to be a big player. CX trading and up to 5 full bases, which will take a while to fill.


[21-Dec-23 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But I think at that point it’s worth paying $8 for PRO at least once. Once you do you drop to BASIC and can now accept contracts. You can also upgrade your ships and your HQ while on PRO

[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Skeltcher**:	Also how do I remove contracts from the contract list? Theres a bunch of "cancelled" contracts here.


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	You can't delete contracts from the Contracts list. They are there forever.


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	You can see Active/Pending Contracts by pressing the SDBR button on the top left of the left-hand list (this also shows you how much $$ you have in each currency)


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I don't think it's possible to restore a screen to the default template (perhaps someone else will correct me). However, the default template isn't the best imo. I suggest designing your own template for each individual base, and then copying that template for all your bases. Include everything you will need on that one page for that base.


[22-Dec-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Having the info you need in the same place every time helps speed up your time per base


[22-Dec-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**STech**:	what to do after finishing tutorial?


[24-Dec-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Unfortunately there is a lot of waiting for your production orders to finish.  The game is very slow in the early stages when you only have one base.


[24-Dec-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	If you are playing on a free account -- you can trade on the exchanges.  Buy low / Sell high can work very well in this game especially on high volume goods.


[24-Dec-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	If you have a Paid account or basic account -- You can also do shipping contracts to make money with your ships.


[24-Dec-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Also.....many of us spend hours planning our future bases with tools like prunplanner.

**Roh**:	This game is very slow, even when you've got a few years into it. The thing is, the more reading time you put into this game in the early stages, the less you'll be putting in as your operations mature.

[26-Dec-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	I may have messed up when starting, I queued my first production order for the max without reading the tutorial and now I'm waiting for like 12 days for that to finish


[26-Dec-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PiBoy314**:	@AlexisRose you can cancel the order with little penalty!


[26-Dec-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You'll get a portion of your input and a portion of your output back


[26-Dec-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Definitely do that as you'll probably run out of consumables before those 12 days are up and you could use the money from smaller orders to expand


[26-Dec-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	unless it's smelting, once it passes a certain threshhold the carbon is no longer recoverable. i'm pretty sure it's % based though so the long runtime could give you more leeway


[26-Dec-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	just make sure to check


[26-Dec-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But probably 12 days is too long

[02-Jan-24 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	This game is played over long periods of time. You’re meant to log in for a few minutes each day to tend to your bases. Although it does get faster eventually,


[02-Jan-24 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Just because there’s so much going on even when production orders still take hours


[02-Jan-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jan-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But in all seriousness, this gameplay hooks certain types of people (like me) with all of the planning and slow execution. The opposite of a RTS game even though it’s in real time

**mama_night**:	can this planet support a farm? the soil fertility level looks kinda on the line. i "specialized" in construction but i want some passive income


[04-Jan-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	if you're just looking to sell something, EXT for ALO and SME for AL are your best option hehe


[04-Jan-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	got it. thank you


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	I have a couple of farms for GRN just to feed a few INC


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	But that also just helps feed the SME for AL


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's recommended that you specialize with the planet's COGC bonus, which for Deimos is smelting. Harmonia is right next door, has better fertility and an agricultural COGC bonus


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	It is worth noting, any planet with fertility *can* grow stuff with farms, just doesn't mean it's going to be efficient to do so :]


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dover**:	And even without fertility, there's always a HYF...


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Very true :]


[04-Jan-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	how do you get more pioneers working for you?


[04-Jan-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	nvm forgot google exists lol


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	nvm google wont tell me why the WF command wont work.


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	WF isn't meant to be accessed manually. open a "BS [planet ticker]" buffer/tile and click the "Workforce" button


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	in this case "BS ZV-759c"


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	oh... weird. thanks!!


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	the workforce command doesn't answer your question though. you get more workforce by building habitation buildings. you will automatically grant you workers depending on their avaliability on the planet and the demands of your other buildings


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you will automatically be granted workers*


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you can roughly see the avaliability of workers by clicking the population number in the "PLI ZV-759c" buffer/tile


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	thanks!


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	on deimos there's enough pioneers for your demands to be immediately met upon constructing buildings that need them. on less populated planets though, you may need to wait for the population report refresh for workers to be allocated to you. you can tell how many workers you will get instantly by the number in parenthesis when looking at buildings in the construction buffer/tile


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	that's quite a bit aways for you to worry about though


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	ok. yea i just started a few days ago. literally just trying to set up an extractor to get some passive income and thought more pioneers would make the construction of it go faster


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	construction of buildings is instant


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you just need to have all the construction materials ready


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	i mean getting the materials for construction sry


[04-Jan-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	ah


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	as long as your buildings are 100% staffed you're good. going over 100% staffing has no benefit


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	just waiting on my order of 10 BSE which has 1 day left


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	are you using luxury consumables like PWO.AI1 and COF.AI1? they improve the efficiency factor of your production lines considerably


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	oh. yea. wow. maybe i need to make another prefab plant then? and no im not. i'll consider it


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	oh you say construction as in producing prefabs? that's rare on deimos


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	that explains the confusion sorry lol


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	I started my second base on an unpopulated world on my 3rd day in the game, so never say never :-) But I got quite a bit of help with it, an experienced player happened to offer a deal for a new player in the global chat that I responded to


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	wow it looks lonely out there lmaoo


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	how'd that even happen?


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	nice! yea i get the feeling this game is filled with players who are nerdy and kind. lol


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	definitely. there's many established players itching to give out loans and grants to new players


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	The player was looking to fund a base for someone to collect HE3. I said I'd be interested but I really had no idea what would be involved with it at that point :-)


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	Now I'm the #13 HE3 producer in the game, and have a regular customer for what I produce there


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	nice!


[04-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	that's the dream

**jvaler**:	lolol


[04-Jan-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	yeah, each building has a "type". that "type" matters because of the CoGC (chamber of global commerce, a planetary infrastructure). the CoGC grants an efficiency bonus to all buildings that align with it's selected "type". deimos' CoGC is metallurgy, meaning things like "BUI SME" are very profitable, and non-metallurgy buildings less so


[04-Jan-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	ah


[04-Jan-24 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	personally, if i were you i would "COLIQ" in a buffer and choose the metallurgy profession on deimos instead. you'd only lose 2 days or so of progress which is very little in the totality of the game. if you'd rather not though, you could work on building SME to supply your prefab plants with AL


[04-Jan-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	wait, PP1 use FE not AL


[04-Jan-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	could import FEO for a while until you get some PP2s

[04-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	they would require PRO license to get any material assistance though


[04-Jan-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	True. No one can help or interact with you directly with you having a PRO or BASIC license.


[04-Jan-24 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	*without


[04-Jan-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mama_night**:	im new and not sure i wanna spend money on this yet. it is a very.. interesting game lol. but im having fun so far


[04-Jan-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	entirely fair. do understand PRO or BASIC licenses are entirely optional for at least the first 3+ months of gameplay or more depending on your speed. the only real hard caps on your growth from not having PRO is the 5 base limit and 2 ship flight limits


[04-Jan-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	and without loans or grants from players that 5 base limit won't be quick to reach, like i said 3+ months at least


[04-Jan-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	so don't feel obligated to buy a license. test the waters first

[05-Jan-24 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jan-24 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Unfortunately, it's not charity. The cash & ships & bmats new players get on start are created out of nothing and are not linked to any in-game mechanic.


[05-Jan-24 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

**sichas**:	if MEA (Quality meal) bought for my workforce (basic), will it increase productivity in Extractor?


[11-Jan-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	no.. MEA is food fpr scientists, EXT only has pioneers


[11-Jan-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	look at your base workforce, there you can find what your workers need


[11-Jan-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sichas**:	ok, thanks


[11-Jan-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jan-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	the cut costs in this case happen to be less than what you'd gain from another SME or EXT


[11-Jan-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CptColeslaw**:	right, if you "save" 100 AIC per day with a FP, but you could have made 200/d with a SME, then the FP isn't actually saving you anything, it's costing you 100. better to smelt more AL and sell it to buy DW/RAT


[11-Jan-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Base planning requires input from shipping constraints, opportunity cost, market availability, and user preference, of course.


[11-Jan-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You could plop down 100% SMEs on Deimos, but then you'd have to feed those furnaces with Ore, FLX, C, and O derived from elsewhere.


[11-Jan-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	A new player with x2 FTL ships could easily do that, but when they decide to expand to other planets, they'll have to make some hard decisions.


[11-Jan-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	there's also the opportunity cost of having my ships constantly in motion between my base and the exchange, not to mention the fuel cost to run all those trips. To my mind I might lose some money in the grand scheme but I'm saving myself hassel in the long run as far as I can see


[11-Jan-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Does anyone know the fastest way to make money in this game? Asking for a friend.


[11-Jan-24 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Embezzlement


[11-Jan-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	used to be pirating NPCs with luck


[11-Jan-24 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	if you're not filling your ships on their run to the market you're loosing money from efficiency, so producing the DW and RATs locally means you eliminate those loses, which are huge for new players


[11-Jan-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	a round trip costs about 2k-2.4k n fuel and the hidden long term costs in repairs, so extra 100 a day from a smelter is actually a huge loss for new players as you need to do round trips at least 2 times a week and that is being conservative about it.


[11-Jan-24 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	you're limited in storage space, until you invest in expanding it, so you can't bring back even if you can afford to tie up so much money in reserve stocks of DW and RATs to achieve fewer trips


[11-Jan-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	for the same reason it is actually better for newer players to produce farming localy then at the farm planet, until they have the resources and scale to move materials efficiently then to do it on the farm planet in the nearby system


[11-Jan-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	you guys are giving bad advice, coming from an already established industrial capacity which can take advantage of scale, where new players cannot  and would be loosing a large part of their profits in transport costs.


[11-Jan-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	thank you!


[11-Jan-24 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	:D


[11-Jan-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	Also early on for new players my advice would be go farming


[11-Jan-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	yeah, I messed up a few times starting my mettalurgy business but we're getting going!


[11-Jan-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	I knew my econ classes would come in handy


[11-Jan-24 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	Get a rig and 2 farmsteads, much bigger profit then 2 smelters, not even close


[11-Jan-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	2 smelters will produce about 7.4 AL per day which comes to around 4.5K when sold, 2 farmsteads will get you a little over 20 GRN a day which you get the same when sold


[11-Jan-24 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	except you have 0 additional costs to make other then the worker costs which are the same


[11-Jan-24 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	where the AL you need to by the base materials


[11-Jan-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	my current plan to bank on technically being a metallurgist is to, after making a food processor to save on food costs, make another farmstead and an incenerator to make carbon, then I don't have to pay anybody for materials to make Al or to survive besides like, clothes and coffee


[11-Jan-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	and then we save money


[11-Jan-24 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	yes


[11-Jan-24 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	I actually run a refinery for my fuel and will now become self suficients on the one smelter, though I make very little from it, 90% of my profits have come from farmsteads and the fuel refinery


[11-Jan-24 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	doing GRN and HCP contracts and it's still not even close to efficient


[11-Jan-24 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	game is too slow, not very liquid, so the simpler the supply chain the higher the return you can consistently get back


[11-Jan-24 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Not very liquid? Supplying consumers with what they need is the best way to get wet. Although, much of the exchanges occur through shady back-door dealings, where the side closets are filled with questionable mannequins adorned in gimpy outfits, and stinky socks left on the ground.


[11-Jan-24 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AlexisRose**:	how do I play the game they're talking about? Sounds fun as heck


[11-Jan-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	@PointyDexter i have no clue what alternate universe you're living in where FRMs and RIGs on __DEIMOS__ is more profitable than COGC aligned SMEs running AL


[11-Jan-24 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	wait i think i see your error. 2 SME do not take up the same area as 2 FRM, you can't compare the two 1:1


[11-Jan-24 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	you can fit 20 SME in 500 area, you can only fit 10 FRM + 9 RIG in that same area


[11-Jan-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@PointyDexter You are going to need to go to the CX to sell your products anyways. Hauling back consumables doesn't cost you extra. Plus if you can find shipping contracts flying either way you make money on the deal


[11-Jan-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@AlexisRose that is a valid play style: Trying to go self sufficient. But you aren't saving money. Sure, you make 10 RAT but you could sell those RAT for 1,000 AIC. When you consume them you lose that opportunity, costing you 1,000 AIC as if you had bought them from the CX


[11-Jan-24 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'd encourage you to look at starting a base on Harmonia if you want to move towards self sufficiency. You get the benefits of having more efficient industry, meaning more profit, meaning faster growth

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	What a wonderfully spirited debate my question started :)


[11-Jan-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	To remind you all, my question was "Does anyone know the fastest way to make money in this game?"


[11-Jan-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	The real answer is "Use other people's money!"


[11-Jan-24 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	This is not a solo game; every single item on the CX was made by a real person. Every blue tile on the planet, indicates a player base.


[11-Jan-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	There are many, many players who will help a newbro with setting up their base, even with setting up a new base from scratch, as well as with ships and resources.


[11-Jan-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I believe the game really gets fun when you move into the 6-12 base stage. Getting there sooner is a good thing imo.


[11-Jan-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	Alright here we go. In 500 space you can fit 8 habitats, 6 rigs and 12 farmsteads for a total cost of 492,400. In the same space you can fit 11 habitats and 23 smelters for a total cost of 763,008.  The farming will produce 90 water per day, that can be turned into 106 GRN with 85 water (5 left over), when sold that brings in 24,500, with production cost of 9,680 before transport costs or a profit of 14,820.  The smelting will produce 159 AL, when sold that brings 95,400, with production costs of 80,870 before transport costs or a profit of 14,530.  In conclusion, the profit is ~3% lower with production line investment ~36% higher. This is with 0 bonuses from experts for either and with the 25% production bonus for the smelting.


[11-Jan-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	It should say 22 smelters above, that was a typo. Anyway farming is a lot less capital intensive and a lot cheaper to setup with a lot simpler production chain.


[11-Jan-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	Also GRN is not necearely the best crop in terms of profitability just one that is liquid enough, so preferable early on, when you need to sell right away as you can't afford high  amounts of capital held in stock buffers, both on the buy and sell sides.


[11-Jan-24 11:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	And last but not least the contracts the game sends often ask for farm produce, which is colected on site, so no travel and direct payment and the ability to get build mats and higher prices for the production.


[11-Jan-24 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	Obviously the farm plante would be better with it's 25% extra bonus, but that is another base that requires a big initial investment to set the it up and get enough production going to offset the additional fuel costs for the longer trip to market, not something a new player can do early on.


[12-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	*Not some a new player can do early on _on their own_.


[12-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	You're leaving out the help new players can/should get from other players.


[12-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hmm, well a few pointers...


[12-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Personally, at least 40% of my game is social.


[12-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	This game gets REALLY fun when you start organizing with players on an informal basis, i.e. no corporate structure. Beyond that, the metrics in this game are, how do you say, dependent upon observation?


[12-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Some people may say you are a loser, others may say you are great. Its all dependent on internal metrics, but in a given span of time, the devs will delete everything when they get past a certain dev stage, so it's literally just a game.


[12-Jan-24 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Initial metrics of early game profitability and ROI work wonders for later stages of development, but that's only if you're going to be beating yourself on arbitrary goals. From my experience, they're extremely fluid, and only make sense if you're doing what you actually want to do, rather than doing what someone else wants.


[12-Jan-24 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	True that, I personally enjoy the logistics management more than the financial sim part of the game, so my decisions aren't always the same as someone just trying to maximize profit.


[12-Jan-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@PointyDexter something in your math is wonky. Using PrUN planner a full SME/EXT base makes 23,400 in profit per day


[12-Jan-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	A RIG/FRM base making GRN only makes 13,000 in profit per day


[12-Jan-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	You're losing out on 10,000 per day which way offsets any perceived shipping losses. It is much much worse to do agriculture on Deimos than other industries like metallurgy or construction


[12-Jan-24 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The game’s faction contracts just ask for things you produce at the beginning. If you make GRN it will ask for GRN. Same with AL


[12-Jan-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Also make sure you’re running the FLX recipe in your SME


[12-Jan-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I ain't gonna read all that :D


[12-Jan-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	@Hernandeur tl:dr - Follow the COGC, make friends, use the tools available in and out of game, do your own research, listen to your governor.


[12-Jan-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	ah yes, yes, I agree entirely 100%


[12-Jan-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sichas**:	so is it reasonable as a new starter to have EXT/SME on Deimos and sell AL in the hub?

***user32b9f066cc** left.*


[12-Jan-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	@Piboy314 I found the tool and ran the numbers there, for farming it comes out with 14,154 and for smelting with 14,845. Which is very close to what I had. MY guess the difference comes from the more precise calculation on the production cycle times. Either way it does not change the point I was making.


[12-Jan-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	14,454 for farming


[12-Jan-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	Again a new player does not have the luxury to wait for best sell price and best buy price, especially on a capital intensive production line with 90K cots per day, which is the smelting.


[12-Jan-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	Farming on the other hand is only 9K per day so it would be easier and likely the profit margins will improve, I'm using the same assumptions for both right now. Lower initial costs and less trips to market will further widen the gap.


[12-Jan-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	I see why you get that number you're using 5 metalurgy expers, no new player will have access to that bonus for months, the calculations are based with 0 experts in both cases

[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	I understand what you're comparing, but if you switch GRN with HER you get the same profitability and still only 1/3rd of the capital needed for turnover


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Moving the goal posts.


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	I was using the base recipe for AL as it's the least capital intensive


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you want to do HER, COLIQ and start over on Harmonia


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	FRM: https://prunplanner.org/shared/e714f540-4d8e-44d9-98a9-b7f4059ef9c1


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	No I'm not the whole point is a new player does not have 90k a day to run that


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No, they don't. They also don't have the 500k to set up a full FRM base


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	and yes I agree having the 25% extra is better but you start on deimos


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	again cost and resources


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	What's the cost of starting over on Harmonia?


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	in my case 2 months time sinked in


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Point is: Advising people to switch to farming, especially GRN as you originally said is a bad move


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PointyDexter**:	short term it's a very good move, long term no, I digress, by the way if people wanna make money they should do STL on deimos, way more profitable but very capital ntensive


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No, bad short term move too.


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No matter how you slice it: Placing FRM on Deimos is not the ideal investment for any player at any stage


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Doubly so with RIG. COGM of H2O produced on Deimos is 32. Market price is 37. That means you only make 5 AIC of profit per H2O. You'd be better off buying H2O from the market and filling that space with other stuff


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Compare that to ALO. COGM is 30 but market price is 102


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	Anyone willing to sell ALO? if so, at what price?


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	post ALO ads to the LM at 75/u, they'll get filled. may take 3-7 days though


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	oh wait, you already did :x


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	Yes, I read your previous message and posted an ad because of it :-)


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	maybe i sucked it all up already lolol. idk i've been buying a lot less now that i have nascent running. odd


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	I'm still figuring out my logistics. I produce enougd ALO on nascent, but haven't figured out exactly what routes my ships can take to keep deimos producing


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	ANT <-> Deimos is a high traffic route. shipping the ALO Nascent -> ANT and then pawning off the rest of the trip to the ANT LM is pretty reliable.


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	It probably won't be a big problem, I still have a couple days left and maybe my ships can be back in time


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	Ah yes, I should probably do that. Haven't been able to figure out the right numbers yet for that either :-)


[12-Jan-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	250t or 500t are generally sweet spots as 250t lets starter ships ship consumables along with your shipment, and 500t fills an empty starter. 185 ALO and 370 ALO respectively

**MvdS**:	Any idea what people on Nascent see as a good price to pick up shipping ads?


[12-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	I had posted a couple a while back, but clearly did not do it in a way people were interested in


[12-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i've been posting 3.5k AIC 500t Nascent -> ANT ads and they've been getting picked up decently quickly. Mostly by 1 person running the trip constantly oddly enough though


[12-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	On Promitor I have never had any issues


[12-Jan-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MvdS**:	Ok, good to know


[12-Jan-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	Nascent is a decently long trip and the people who have bases there and ship consistently 99% have their own ALO or C to export and can't fit your stuff. That's why the prices are a bit higher

**Drucker**:	Does it make sense to collect Oxygen on Deimos, or should I just buy it at the CX? Sorry if this is a complete noob question, but I am a complete noob.


[20-Jan-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drucker**:	Clarification, I am presently extracting ALO and smelting AL.


[20-Jan-24 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It could go either way for O. I think it's probably more profitable to buy it on the CX and spend that money to expand AL operations. But I'm not sure it's *that* much more profitable. And it removes one input to worry about.

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	SE-648c is the best O planet in ANT, probably the best O planet in the game. And because it's liquid O, you use RIGs instead of COLs to gather the O, meaning you can fit far more RIGs and pull a crazy amount of O per day.


[22-Jan-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Main downside I see is using HSE on a planet where you'd have loads of RIGs, not to mention INS..but I suspect rhe sheer output of that base would make up for that :p

**roganartu**:	hello friends, my group finds themselves in need of a new ALO supplier on deimos. We make BBH and BSE between here and Nike which is split weekly between all participants. Send me a dm in game or in discord (same name) if you're interested. Zero interest loans available to get the base setup

**Churaviis**:	Nascent is a good planet to extract ALO from


[26-Jan-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	yeah but moving the extraction to nascent turns an ALO problem into a logistics problem. When you consume 1500/d the logistics problem


[26-Jan-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	is nice to avoid (not sure why that sent, silly mobile apex)


[26-Jan-24 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	my constant nascent -> ANT -> deimos shipping ads on the CX LM are an example of that lmao


[26-Jan-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's easier to add ships than base area


[26-Jan-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Drucker**:	I did the math 3 days ago, producing AL using the FLX recipe increases SME profit per hour by ~50% compared to the AL recipe without FLX.


[27-Jan-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Drucker**:	My calculation for my setup assumed extracting ALO on my base, and buying C, O, and FLX at the CX.

**WolfTomoe**:	more than playing this game, I want work with dev to give ideas on UI


[06-Feb-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfTomoe**:	for common instance check UI for flight storage. why so cluttered while storing from storage to cargo. simply give a box to input how much you want to store rather than 5 boxes with 1, 1k, 5k written


[06-Feb-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfTomoe**:	you cannot even search item on commodity exchange


[06-Feb-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-24 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	the first thing you can do, the latter will probably come eventually. it's in alpha...

**Neuzn**:	So my first production really needs 15h?


[06-Feb-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	depends on what you're producing, but that doesn't sound unreasonable for this game


[06-Feb-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Neuzn**:	14 aluminium ore


[06-Feb-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ASpider**:	It's not a fast game. I queued 140 for my first run. 5 Days left.

**Neuzn**:	oh thats sad, i hoped the beginning is much faster


[06-Feb-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	there are people gladly handing out free money to new Antares players to help keep them engaged through the early game. if you're interested this is the link: https://discord.gg/eDquZD7H do note that a PRO license is required to recieve contracts from other players (the only way to privately give other people items/currency)

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	When you start, your biggest assets are your ships. You can't sell them, but you can use them to run contracts. Often you can make more (after fuel and repairs) running contracts than you can from your starting base.


[24-Feb-24 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	That changes later when you have more bases, and contracts aren't worthwhile.


[24-Feb-24 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Another tip is to talk to absolutely everyone. People are really friendly in this game, and dragons love to help newbros get their empires up and running.


[24-Feb-24 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	When I started, I got many, MANY opportunities outside the normal or expected gameplay that really helped speed up my game.

[24-Feb-24 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	speed. 2 buildings just means you'd be running 2 recipes at a time, so twice as fast, no change to efficiency


[24-Feb-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rifleman**:	but you would need twice the amount of workforce

[05-Mar-24 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**KZ_Kawasaki**:	Yeah, you have to wait and come back tomorrow. It is such a slow start.  There are player groups out there that give loans to give you more of a boost tho.

**RiseofFilth**:	remember, profit is really made by maximizing you efficiency, on whatever you are doing. Specializing and focusing your experts to match the COGC bonuses is key. For deimos, that means smelting, and as many SME as you can get. race to get 5 experts for max speed bonuses for your production cycle time

**Exeler**:	Yup, early on the game is a slow start. Especially since you want to minimize how much fuel you're spending on transportation. Later on fuel costs become irrelevant, but early on they can be significant.


[05-Mar-24 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	So it makes sense to try and buy as many input supplies at once as possible, then hold off on transporting the goods back to the CX for as long as possible.

**Hernanduer**:	we're always open to new members in ANT space, especially if they're active and want to be social. We do require new members to have a paid membership, as most social features are useless without access to contracts


[11-Mar-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	membership to the game, to be clear. Joining OOG and staying is free

[27-Mar-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Apr-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Talryk**:	My first suggestion (not that I'm an expert) would be to decide where you want to expand to; having a metallurgist start doesn't mean you're pigeonholed into that industry, but it's a decent starting point. You'll have to start considering from where you'll source your input materials, and how much it'll cost you

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I think the only planet I don't follow the COGC for, are for EXTs that feed the main production buildings that do. Even with higher outlay costs, it's always better to follow the COGC bonus.


[04-Apr-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Also, depending on your perspective, the price of AL coming down to 500/u is not a "crash"; it's a "correction back to normal". At least, it is for me.


[04-Apr-24 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	What normally happens is people will either pivot to other SME products, or expand to do vertical integration (fabs being most common).

**Titaneste**:	hello. i'm new. if i cancel a production order (like 10 water at 50%) will i receive the 5 water?


[08-Apr-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Titaneste**:	if i dont cancel it, Do i get the water over time (like 1 every 10%), or all at once when the full order is finished?


[08-Apr-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talryk**:	Unsure about what happens if you cancel halfway through, but I do know that you will only receive the product at the end of its production cycle


[08-Apr-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Titaneste**:	Ah damn; i started a 30 days order, but i need the resource before


[08-Apr-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Titaneste**:	thanks for the info


[08-Apr-24 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Talryk**:	Yup, you'll have to queue them up in smaller batches to receive product over time


[08-Apr-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	huh no


[08-Apr-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	just click on cancel and it'll tell you what you get back


[08-Apr-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	you should indeed get 50% of the end product if you cancel at 50% in


[08-Apr-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	you won't get everything back 100%, there's still a penalty to cancelling, but it shouldn't be that bad

**Vannak201**:	So i just started the game and i have to wait 15 hours for it to produce an aluminum?


[22-Apr-24 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yup! You should send one of your ships off to the local commodity exchange to buy some luxury consumables to help speed that up a little bit (PWO and COF, maybe down to 12 hours).


[22-Apr-24 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	This game is played in the long term. Things keep running in the background when you’re logged off. Most people start by playing 5-10 minutes per day (and putting in anywhere between zero to many hours planning besides that)


[22-Apr-24 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vannak201**:	thanks piboy. Love the UI of the game but the amount of time waiting on resource production is too much for me

**Nopetapus**:	Well, the advantage of the commodities exchange on Antares is that we don't really have to know the trade routes.


[14-May-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nopetapus**:	The other nearby population centers are a Harmonia, Hephaestus, and Phobos. I'm still pretty new, so I don't have a good grasp of the further afield trading activity.


[14-May-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I think you’ll find that most movement is people moving their own products, and a vertical integration type setup. There isn’t too much public contract trading planet to planet, rather than planet to CX

**CovfefeFeatherbottom**:	I think the easiest and cheapest is right here from scratch.  That's what I do and it's enough for me.   Or, if you need a lot, harmonia I believe is the closest farm planet

**DvorakDwarf**:	High price of AL ?


[21-May-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-May-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-May-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Salvart**:	wondering*


[24-May-24 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	5 units


[24-May-24 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Salvart**:	Okay Thanks !


[24-May-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**medakinga**:	do yall make your own oxygen?


[24-May-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	I recently made a COL for O here. Not positive it was a good idea, but it was an idea. Currently over producing for my current setup, but that's room for expansion and profits.


[24-May-24 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	Also, I'm pretty new here.


[24-May-24 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	have you worked out how much it is costing you to produce 1 O yourself vs buying 1 O on the cx?


[24-May-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	it may be better to use your available area for something more economical


[24-May-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	I was running thing through PrunPlanner with FIO setup. Things looked like it's a profit in the O department.


[24-May-24 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	it's probably cheaper to produce your own O, but consider the opportunity cost


[24-May-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	Overall, it seems like I'm pushing my company into profits. Now I just need to determine if building more EXT and SME is better than going for the upper metallergy based builldings.


[24-May-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	I'm currently looking into the viablility of a FS and the supply costs for the products.


[24-May-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	have a look at a GF too


[24-May-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	im running 25 of them on this planet


[24-May-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	Yea, that was another I thought about, but BRO looked tasty.


[24-May-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	Big problem was the procurment of CU or more so CUO.


[24-May-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	I'm still really early here tho. barely over a week tbh. My equity is looking great tho :D


[24-May-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	when considering what to produce, one of the most important things to look at is liquidity


[24-May-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	is anyone actually buying any of what you're looking to produce?


[24-May-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	looking at BRO, not a single unit has been bought in the last 30 days


[24-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	at least not on the cx, you might be able to find someone who will buy regularly off you


[24-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	I sell all of my GL to a private buyer who takes my entire production


[24-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	Been pooring over the CX for oppourtunities. Haven't set anything in stone yet. Just a basic 1 EXT, 2 SME, and 1 COL atm. Other idea was just to expand into more EXT and SME.


[24-May-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deimos**:	I haven't made trade partners yet. Also looking to join a corp too. Just window shopping a lot of stuff atm.


[24-May-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-May-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Crustysock**:	I don't mind the minor loss.  It's not a material I use but a block of 5 extractors filled out the area on the base better than more BMP's


[12-Jun-24 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crustysock**:	84/ALO is also double the Market Maker price and still nets me profit after factoring luxuries

**jcheung9941**:	so. anything interesting going on?


[24-Jun-24 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	more importantly, any advice for a FNG?


[24-Jun-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	A Flying Neutron Generator?


[24-Jun-24 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	I suggest you try and keep it on the ground to keep it as a GNG


[24-Jun-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Well AL prices are starting to land back down


[24-Jun-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	sad to see those profits go


[24-Jun-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	oh. AL prices are going down? uhhh... well. maybe i shouldn't spec so hard into al refining xD


[24-Jun-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	FNG = F*ing New Guy


[24-Jun-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	AL refining is consistently profitable


[24-Jun-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	Drop a DM or a message here if you need any further help :)


[24-Jun-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	One tip is to keep a little surplus money in case you get in a pinch


[24-Jun-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LargeFoot**:	also don't spend every single penny you have on buying only rations...


[24-Jun-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i don't have pro, so i can't take loans :(


[24-Jun-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i plan on keeping a 4k reserve fund for now


[24-Jun-24 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	....though i'm kicking myself because i bought a bunch of water and rations and then the noob quests gave me a boatload of both


[24-Jun-24 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	you also have access to ADI out here in Antares space. I see you on the UFO Server. Give us a lookup, we do grants (once you've decided if you want to pay for the game)


[24-Jun-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	yeah, i was looking at ADI


[24-Jun-24 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	figure i'll give it a month and if i'm still here i'll spend for a month


[24-Jun-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	that's fair. I took about 2 weeks myself


[24-Jun-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	What sort if grants?


[24-Jun-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	that might be something of interest for me


[24-Jun-24 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	might be convinced sooner if i find a group of people to talk to regularly


[24-Jun-24 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Thats the way to play, talk to people


[24-Jun-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i saw something on discord for... grant of up to 750k or something


[24-Jun-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	no repayment


[24-Jun-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	need basic or pro license


[24-Jun-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Damn, ill have a look


[24-Jun-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	...though there is that little bit that says people without are allowed too, so maybe i'll join just for community


[24-Jun-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Ill take a look


[24-Jun-24 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I'll see both of you on discord, then!


[24-Jun-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	in the same forum, there's another guy offering 100k 0% loan, 10k repayment a week... so combine both and you can start off with 850k


[24-Jun-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Well, iv got about 3.5M in loan in the form of pre-payed AL but more money is alwats good


[24-Jun-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	oh. huh. uh


[24-Jun-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	went to go DM astra, and we share no servers. is there another PoC?


[24-Jun-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	for ADI i mean


[24-Jun-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	but iv got plans that would need 3M$


[24-Jun-24 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	im waiting to have fleshed out my AL production before going to raise some more money


[24-Jun-24 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	plans that need 3m huh. i'll just look at my plans to develop two bases and cry a bit because 3m would finish both of them if i just bought straight from the market


[24-Jun-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	the new POC for ADI is jvaler. You're all welcome to just join the server

[25-Jun-24 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	You should be able to know if the game is for you with the free version


[25-Jun-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	if it is, then 70 is worth it


[25-Jun-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mela_mecantile**:	ok thx :)


[25-Jun-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	if not then that’s fine, it’s a niche game


[25-Jun-24 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Do ask questions, it’s can be a tough learning experience

**evayoo**:	what do you mean about your fleet do things? if you just started theres not really mcuh for your fleet to do at this stage until you have things worth hauling / supplies


[29-Jun-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**evayoo**:	people don't always check in-game chat too often most players use discord like most things nowadays. If you have questions i'd encourage you to check discord either official or JcMJy2vF which is an antares based community!


[29-Jun-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boogster**:	QuietKnight there's also a help channel specifically for getting help. And everyone in it is super nice and knowlegable.

**Shrewdsun1**:	Sounding for interest. If I setup distribution of C/O/Flux on Deimos, anyone here would be interested in getting their supply delivered? Would be delivered at a slight markup from market but only to be paid 7 days latwr


[29-Jun-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boogster**:	Shrewd i would but i don't have the capital to make an aggreement lol


[29-Jun-24 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	the LM here is perfect for exactly those use cases. Most people would probably pay 10-15% more if they didn't have to haul themselves

[29-Jun-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	Thanks Tanda, I was asking because ideally I’m looking to setup recurring supply deals. It was the main things I did last time I played and would like to setup a network of the sort in Ant. The LM is good for one offs but less for recurring deals


[29-Jun-24 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	if you have any planets you’d want stuff regularly delivered let me know

**Yinxx**:	The DNPC project is to integrate a number of horizontal bases (bases with only one Expert Specialist), primarily on Deimos and Nike, to make BSE and BBH.

[29-Jun-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	You mean you are going to leave Deimos and are looking for a player to fill that spot?


[29-Jun-24 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Nope nope. I run the project, i just have a few folks who are stepping down or shifting to other projects.


[29-Jun-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Oh ok, cool. When exchanging plots, you just do it at the same time or there is another way of transfering it without possibitlity of other players stealing it?


[29-Jun-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Oh no! We actually employ you. To extract ALO and O here. We can give out loans for construction costs


[29-Jun-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Oh :D I completly misunderstood :D I thought that you are going to leave a plot for another player to start a base :D


[29-Jun-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	I wish, hahah


[29-Jun-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Also a question: Does multi-permit base consume more plots?


[29-Jun-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	It does not.


[29-Jun-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Never needed that information but just wondering :D good to know


[29-Jun-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yinxx**:	Most players stay away from adding permits


[29-Jun-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Yeah, it rarely makes sense


[29-Jun-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hey Deimos! For the new players who don't know me, to the older players who see my name on a lot of planets, I am Rise. I have governed directly on Hephaestus for the past 25 election cycles, and have managed 15+ other planets via proxy governors for various periods of time since I started 2 years ago. I saw that in Antares, no corporation or group of people had stepped up in a meaningful way to competently manage any planet outside of the main ones that made the most money for them. And the few planets outside these large few were being by someone, often were done so very poorly. I’ve been an advocate for good governors and competent governance since I started holding office, and an opponent to any who take the office for granted and do not consistently manage the population well.


[04-Jul-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That time has mostly passed us now, and Paris_In_Springtime is someone I can attest to as a communicative and competent governor, open to discussion and suggestion. He has his eye on the population and his finger on the COGC fulfillment. Should he lack any votes to be in the governor spot, I would highly encourage folks to throw a vote his way. That being said, if his vote count is looking healthy, I would appreciate it greatly if you voted for me. It would be a pleasure and honor to sit alongside him. You will not regret either vote.


[04-Jul-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I can also say that LazySiege is a stand up guy and has done a great job Governing Nascent. If someone is looking for a 3rd place vote, I think he would be a stellar option.

**kurzninja**:	I see when looking at the exchanges there's lots of outstanding orders for stuff that looks like those prices will never be met, do people just leave them outstanding forever in hopes that it comes down or do you normally just cancel and reorder?

[02-Aug-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	He's kindly decided to use his time and wealth to try bring stability to the market by being the Market Maker (MM) on both sides. You'll see he's got trades on almost every product in the game.


[02-Aug-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	I just realized I have like 120K in outstanding orders that will maybe never be filled


[02-Aug-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	A player trying to be a MM staple is not called a Market Maker. They are instead, proffered the title of Market Master.


[02-Aug-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I stand correct ty 😉


[02-Aug-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can just delete them @kurzninja --- it's not like you get charged marginal fees for your CXOS orders.


[02-Aug-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	I guess it's a matter of do I tie up that money waiting for a possibly lower price to come around some day or free up that money and buy it now at a higher price. Decisions, decisions.


[02-Aug-24 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you can drop down a market ticker of some commodity that you'd like to consider, and maybe we all can pitch in with suggestions?


[02-Aug-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	HCP.NC1 for example --- a common necessity for C production, or say more complicated stuff for higher tier base consumables.


[02-Aug-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	i was specifically looking at C.AI1


[02-Aug-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	I thought about just trying to produce it myself but that's complicated


[02-Aug-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	might be cheaper to buy the HCP and then burn it myself instead of the complete chain from growing to burning


[02-Aug-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Well you can burn, HCP, GRN, or MAI for C --- it's not just HCP.


[02-Aug-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	right. i'd rather use my H20 for DW than plants. I might need to make some spreadsheets to work this out lol


[02-Aug-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you can make easy comparisons (opportunity cost). Do I sell my water, or do I keep it? Should I keep it, should I use it for DW, or plants. Should I make plants, do I sell them on the CX, or do I burn them?


[02-Aug-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	ROI is a good idea. Capital investment costs are a good idea. Shipping tonnage/intervals weekly are a good idea.


[02-Aug-24 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	can you elaborate on that last part? Shipping?


[02-Aug-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you get more complicated, you'll probably want to ask yourself, how much cost do I have to sink into commodities, to keep a base running for at least a week, without immediate resupply.


[02-Aug-24 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah...


[02-Aug-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lets say you have a starter FTL ship, with 500 t/m3 of capacity, available for only 1 delivery at a planet, weekly (arbitrary example). Your base then could make only 2500 units of H2O, weekly, before you will have to start to look for other solutions. If you make more than what you can handle, you will have to outsource jobs to others who can do them for you. If not, then you will meet Input/Output logistical limits, since you just can't handle it yourself.


[02-Aug-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Your base will eventually overflow with material, that you can't move to another warehouse inventory, and your production will literally stop.


[02-Aug-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	Gotcha, I thought you meant shipping for others as a way of making money. I don't think I"m anywhere near the level of production to run up against the problem you're talking about lol


[02-Aug-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Shipping for others may be a good idea, if you need like some extra cash, built up over time, on routes that you don't have to go out of your way for.


[02-Aug-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But, per my projections, you will almost never make more money with them, as compared to bases.


[02-Aug-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If your bases make only like 35k in profits daily, then yeah you could start to invest in large numbers of ships, past like say base #50. Before that, it doesn't make sense, since the opportunity cost, and ROI, for more bases, far outweights that of shipping.


[02-Aug-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**kurzninja**:	I have one base I'm barely keeping afloat... LOL


[02-Aug-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Currently in the game, ships are more of a necessary expense that furthers your basebuilding, and they sometimes can make some extra money. However, with the more profitable processes, you'll likely be making far more than 32k of profits daily.


[02-Aug-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	People also low-ball you with shipping rewards. They basically make knee-jerk decisions, depending on how long their exports have been sitting in their inventories. Less than 2k in fees, per 500 t/m3 if picked up during the week.


[02-Aug-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	More than 20k per 500 t/m3 if no one even bothers picking it up for a month, or more.


[02-Aug-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But that's just all from the public LM stuff that I've seen. If you wanna do stuff profitably, private ventures are the way to go.

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	We, the humble representatives of your will, have found a way to enact a truly fair Graduated Taxation.


[13-Aug-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	As Deimos is a starter planet, we felt it was important that new players not be burdened by the upkeep needs, and so PIO taxes are kept at a historic low.

[13-Aug-24 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Taxes upon higher level buildings were raised, with an eye that the most profitable buildings paid a proportionate amount in txes.


[13-Aug-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Although this may not fully close the gap between taxes and upkeep, we are certain these small but important steps will help Deimos continue to be a fair and lovely place to pollute the environment with smelters and smog.

**CptColeslaw**:	production fees for buildings that employ pioneers. check "LR ZV-759c" to see the local rules for Deimos. Under the production fees section it will show you how much each tier of workforce is taxes in each industry. Really, it's a super minor expense that most people don't even really think about unles you're one of us crazy enough to get into managing planets

If you are looking for a new person to support with Megasaber not running, Tanda is a good choice. PS. Dont forget Rotarycyclone!

**Pxlfox**:	you do you do profit with the current C prices? Interstellar Gaia is capping the prices around 700 AIC, while Aluminium for example sells for around 715 AIC - considering the transportation and staff costs there is like no profit in it


[17-Sep-24 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	Ah, wait - the recipe is 1 Carbon to 3 Aluminium ... maths


[17-Sep-24 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	but still, it feels harsh


[17-Sep-24 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Laaxus**:	AL and C are not the most profitable business currently


[17-Sep-24 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Laaxus**:	if you don't buy, sell and transport in bulk, your margin are even thinner


[17-Sep-24 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Laaxus**:	try CU, CF or LI


[17-Sep-24 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	that might be and I going to check out those markets, thank you. I just started, so I have to do the best of my one base I'm currently limited to... and on Deimos there is just ALO ...


[17-Sep-24 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	I could try to setup a carbon production line. I wouldn't be the most effective one, but would reduce costs for buying carbon.


[17-Sep-24 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-24 04:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Tanda**:	I would suggest you join the ADI discord so you can get that investment. They offer guidance and grants of 1mil AIC to new players. https://discord.gg/XUpknJWg


[06-Oct-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	don't get me wrong, I'd love to have more ALO extraction but it's not the most profitable profession for someone on Deimos


[06-Oct-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**kynadre**:	is a nice cash infusion if you have extra or can't quite afford enough extractors to keep up, though

Lyrics:

You think you're smart
You're not

Coming to tear me apart
All this bitching and...

[24-Oct-24 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Non808**:	is that this games version of telling me to rope myself? :)


[24-Oct-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yes, and no? This is a #long-term game... People who've made mistakes, even on a comapny instance, are usually frowned upon. It takes a while to build back up player relationships, trust, business partnerships, and whatnot.


[24-Oct-24 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Immediate COLIQs asking for quick and easy money, whatever way they can, is not the best way to start-off again?!?


[24-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Non808**:	Yeah I did let my pro lapse when I wasn't playing but hopefully I'll be around for a lot longer this time


[24-Oct-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Welp....


[24-Oct-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Non808**:	Ah so not too much political corruption then, no major deregulation or trampling of workers rights to be done


[24-Oct-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Non808**:	Unfortunate


[24-Oct-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most people, everywhere?!? Are doing the best, with what they have --- which is generally not much info/data.


[24-Oct-24 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	@SilentReaper Good Sir! You have beaten me to populular COMG acclaim....


[02-Nov-24 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But I must say @DJonni, those planetery name-sakes are misplaced. We are Antares (anti-Ares)... And not beholden to Ares him-self.


[02-Nov-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Take a gander, at the mythos beholden, to not only Deimos, but also to Phobos....


[02-Nov-24 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	In Greek mythology, Deimos /ˈdaɪmɒs/ (Ancient Greek: Δεῖμος, lit. 'fear'[1] pronounced [dêːmos]) is the personification of fear.[2] He is the son of Ares and Aphrodite, and the brother of Phobos. Deimos served to represent the feelings of dread and terror that befell those before a battle, while Phobos personified feelings of fear and panic in the midst of battle.


[02-Nov-24 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So to what incentive to we Antareans hold strong to... That distateful, and combative, and discordant nature, begetting from that Are'an offsprring, whom few hold dear, or do we partake, in our name'sake, and build a better future for ourselves... Without fear, without dread, but with a stubborn pride, from all that we have built for ourselves!?!?

**Roh**:	Stinky blue cheese, all the way!


[03-Nov-24 01:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	I must admit, I do prefer my grilled cheeses with.... cheese. Preferred cheese ideally comes out of a chemical plant in stead of cow's tits.


[03-Nov-24 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	For the American style processed cheeses... they just add sodium citrates to the batches. It lets them stay gooey.


[03-Nov-24 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	Can't be sodium cirtratey enough if you ask me.

**Akyan**:	FYI - I've placed 5 ASM since the last POPR, which will increase the demand for engineers by 100. Let me know if you want to send over funding for an eng immigration program.

[17-Nov-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	It's a message for the governer & MPs who manage the planet. I've put down some buildings that will increase the demand for engineers beyond those presently available. You can see the current population available for each type by using the "POPR ZV-759b" command.


[17-Nov-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I've observed they're already running a programme to build up the population, which they may have already planned to run again. I've offered to pay for a targeted program to increase the engineer population to ensure there are sufficient engineers for everyone, if they want to take up the offer.


[17-Nov-24 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	If you're a governer or an member of parliament there's an option to run various types of programmes to increase the population.


[17-Nov-24 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Thanks for letting us know Akyan. More ASMs in the area are always great 🙂

[15-Dec-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Hey Pomme, I will check it out. Currently our finances are tight, running ~480k per period on the positive, so there's not a big buffer for investment, but maybe I can donate some. Let me see what we can do about it.


[15-Dec-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	More a matter of general principle. Given the high masses for things, seems like having 5K for everyone would be beneficial, especially since 3K can't even bank a week of inputs for a single permit smelter base.


[15-Dec-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I agree the warehouse could be a bit bigger... helps a lot.


[15-Dec-24 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-24 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-24 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-24 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-24 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I run 4 STO and have to be very careful what i send. Bu i also run 2 permits and mix FS and SME


[16-Dec-24 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	My logic is that while WH space gets to be pricey to build, WH space is also overall more efficient for the planet. It's pretty much necessary to allow local segmented storage, but beyond that if it is built up and allows everyone to save a STO and build another production building, on a planet that is near max pop that's a fair bit of increased production.


[16-Dec-24 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	On a world where everything is so storage-intensive, the segmentation value is still quite high though. Especially if you're trying to keep an emergency buffer or utilizing external shipping.


[16-Dec-24 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	At any rate, I don't remember if I said it, but thanks @Frentic for bumping it up.

**Wildgardener**:	When I first started playing over 1000 days ago triple permits were encouraged. I have 3 triple permit bases, no warehouses anywhere, not even at CXLs. Not boasting, hoepfully not foolish, but just trying to show we don't all have to play the same way. BTW I don't use spreadsheets either...


[16-Dec-24 07:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Truly the most "Frontier" playstyle I've heard of. Neat.


[16-Dec-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	hey nice @Wildgardener. I can't live without my main warehouse in MOR. Right now I have 46k tons there in several different materials that I have buffers on.


[16-Dec-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	I use warehouses for Input/Output logistics in all planets. I enjoy bigger warehouses since it lets me avoid building more STOs :)


[16-Dec-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Sometimes 2-3 permits are the way to go too, I have two 3-permit bases, one 2-permit bases and all else is 1 permit.


[16-Dec-24 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I seem to either do 1 or 3.


[16-Dec-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	my 2-permit base is a HER base... to supply my daily consumption I needed two permits :)


[16-Dec-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	thinking on tearing it down as soon as HER market becomes more reliable.


[16-Dec-24 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Ahhh. Yeah, I just spun off a secondary operation for HER alone near where I process it, then supplement with my big 3 permit that is mostly ORCs.


[16-Dec-24 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	So people are still  playing with 3 permit bases! I've heard so many people recently saying it's a waste of resources I was beginning to wonder if they still existed.


[16-Dec-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	It almost certainly is if you're trying to maximize for production and profit.


[16-Dec-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I just don't have the fleet or the desire to manage 2 dispersed planets in many cases.


[16-Dec-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	@Wildgardener it's just perspective. If a person only cares about maximizing ROI, 1 permit bases are the way to go.


[16-Dec-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	to me, ROI isn't the main factor (or else I wouldnt be making IDC)

**Frentic**:	logistics is way more important to me, as a semi-new player. then, 3 permit bases become very attractive.


[16-Dec-24 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Honestly I'm looking at making a few IDC bases in the not-too-distant future for exactly that reason.


[16-Dec-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Haven't got the buildout funds, but one in each market seems like a pretty low-effort way to largely ignore the FX market day to day.


[16-Dec-24 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I don't  actually sell much. I like just making things and hoarding them...


[16-Dec-24 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Hah. We'll know you've reached your win condition when things start mysteriously becoming black holes.


[16-Dec-24 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	After 1000+ days there's not much left to do. Is there such a thing as a win condition?


[16-Dec-24 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	1000+ days man, thats really nice... yeah the game lacks a bit on endgame objectives right now (maybe thats why the gateways are being developed right now)


[16-Dec-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	our corp has a bigger objective, lets say an endgame one, to colonize the RIM and make it functional for new habitants.


[16-Dec-24 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Lots of subjective "win" conditions... Nothing objective... Maybe if you get a badge for concurrent playtime of 1000+ days, that would be something. Other than the LEADs, there's nothing to really grasp at.


[16-Dec-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Where counts as the RIM?


[16-Dec-24 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	I'd like  a badge...


[16-Dec-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	RIM is everywhere my corp decides RIM is. I never could get that answer as an objective answer hahahahaha


[16-Dec-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	the jewel of the RIM is Saladin, the most fertile planet.


[16-Dec-24 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	From Saladin to MOR, on factionless space, thats RIM.


[16-Dec-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Gateways will probably make RIM more relevant. Lets see.


[16-Dec-24 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	some people call it Outer Rim... its funny.


[16-Dec-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	more fertile than Pyrgos?


[16-Dec-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	Yes: 1. Saladin (PG-899b) 112.18 % fertility. (.2. Promitor.) 3. Pyrgos (CH-771a) 111.98 %


[16-Dec-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wildgardener**:	Not a huge difference. Maybe I'm just biased?


[16-Dec-24 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	No no, its all good. Its not a big difference.

**Wildgardener**:	What did you need a SOL for? DCH or SP?


[20-Dec-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	The problem is that SOL costs 1,187 in material costs alone at current market prices - not to mention depreciation, logistics costs, and a healthy profit to make it worthwhile


[20-Dec-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	The highest SOL bid of quantity is 1000

[03-Jan-25 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aromis**:	Great thx!  What do flux do?


[03-Jan-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	It's a more profitable recipe, you get an extra unit of aluminum for the price of a unit of flux.


[03-Jan-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

**jvaler**:	Hello yet again Antares! The Antares Development Initiative is here to let all the newbies know about our offer to upgrade your starter 500t/500m^3 ships into WCB 3000t/1000m^3 ships! | Our in-house Project Ship Kit™ has been up and running for some time now and we have ~30 WCB upgrade kits to sell. | They cost ₳1.35mil each, however we also offer financing to help you cover this cost. | This takes the form of a 0% interest 90 day loan, which comes out to just ₳15k/d in cost. | If you're interested, join the ADI server and let us know! https://discord.gg/N6bXSuvbuw

**Avenue**:	is there anyway to upgrade a ship's storage capacity?


[22-Jan-25 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Avenue**:	i got too much ore and not much space to get them out lol


[22-Jan-25 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, there are different types of cargo bays you can install into a ship


[22-Jan-25 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you can see them if you open the BLU buffer (blueprints), create a new blueprint and look at the different cargobays


[22-Jan-25 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyeus_Phter**:	Antares Development Initiative discord offers high tonnage cargo bay upgrade kits loans. Essentially it's all the mats needed to bring a 500t/500m³ starter ship to a 3000t/1000m³ workhorse, divided up into 10(?) payments w/o interest to make the transaction more bite sized @Avenue


[22-Jan-25 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I remember getting this deal from the previous governor of Deimos, back when I first started. The WBC upgrade on both my starting ships was a game-changer and I still think of him fondly because of it.

**hartensteinj**:	how do you set ships to auto unload apon arrival


[25-Jan-25 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	you just click the 'unload on arrival' words in the SFC screen when your setting up the flight. It's a PRO feature though


[25-Jan-25 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Laxy**:	Weird paywall feature imo


[25-Jan-25 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Laxy**:	As a pro member*


[25-Jan-25 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Djonni**:	Seems totally reasonable to me that PRO includes a suite of QoL and automation improvements. Stuff you don't need to play and succeed, but which make it less onerous to do so


[25-Jan-25 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it's a fine line.  you don't want to make the base name too annoying, or else no one will buy it


[25-Jan-25 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	it's not like it's even a good QoL feature


[25-Jan-25 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	can't change it after departure


[25-Jan-25 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-25 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i feel around half of the restrictions are stupid


[25-Jan-25 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	makes f2p insanely annoying


[25-Jan-25 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	HQ limit, local markets? okay. easier CX navigation, ship upgrades? fine. queues, repairing all buildings at the same time? come on...


[25-Jan-25 11:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	How about no queue adjustments without pro? Seems a bit silly that it makes you cancel and redo just to move some order around


[25-Jan-25 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	oh, that's a pro feature? didn't even know, i didn't adjust my queues while free...


[25-Jan-25 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	it is...


[25-Jan-25 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i'm gonna hate my life when i go back to basic....


[25-Jan-25 11:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Mar-25 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs.

**EvoV**:	It would be interesting to see what sort of player produces more. One that is part of a communistic collective who's focus is production. Or one that plays solo who's focus is profit + supply + demand.


[14-Mar-25 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**jcheung9941**:	i think that comparison is unfair


[14-Mar-25 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	as you set no restriction on the size of the collective


[14-Mar-25 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	so the "collective" could be 50 people vs 1 person


[14-Mar-25 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	there's also no limitations on how organized the collective is


[14-Mar-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	on the low end, they could be so ineffective that nearly nothing is ever produced, all buildings are 180+d without repair


[14-Mar-25 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	on the extreme high end, could have 1000 bases (50 people * 20) and producing... i don't know, what's being used as the measuring stick?


[14-Mar-25 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	ships?


[14-Mar-25 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I was happy in FIOC at the start my PU experience, until my empire evolved into becoming independent of their communistic support.


[14-Mar-25 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I left FIOC because I wanted to stop providing my production to others whom werent interested in growing their HQ counts to keep steady.  More take than give.


[14-Mar-25 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I then wanted to become independent of my communistic-obligations and so I left FIOC and so far-so good. :)


[14-Mar-25 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	IMO, FIOC is good for soft-landing of new players and for casual players whom dont want stressed.


[14-Mar-25 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	did they give you any sort of support to get standing on your own?


[14-Mar-25 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Consumables primarily.  Inputs to make Outputs, if the Outputs were expected by another FIOC member [to process into whatever].  Take the inputs, make the output, give the output when called to.


[14-Mar-25 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	HQ upgrade mats (FAB's etc) only when the benefit was of benefit to FIOC (or someone's, i dunno).  Seemed kinda arbitrary IMO.


[14-Mar-25 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	As for Ships: Well over a year of service in FIOC and I left with the 2 starter-ships upgraded to WCB  &&  parts for 1 LCB FTL ship provided to me.


[14-Mar-25 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Im really torn.  Communist -vs- Independence.  Hmm.  I bet FIOC keep peepz from quitting the game earlier than they would if they be left on their own.  On the other hand, if a player-style is more than that of a casual FIOC player [therefore more productive with their time/strategy/planning], then they'll outgrow the FIOC collective dependence soon enough and have to find a way to exit FIOC while keeping a good rep w/ FIOC + Community.  While also ensuring that they able keep themselves stocked w/ Consumables + the Input's that FIOC were giving.


[14-Mar-25 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i meant more when you went off on your way, did you just have what was in your bases, or did they properly set you up to go off on your own?


[14-Mar-25 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	The former.  I was the one who cut the cord.  When I went my own way, I had what I had in the various bases.  It was cold-turkey.  Some of my bases starved while some were ok.  I had to figure it out.


[14-Mar-25 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

I dunno if they would have set me [us] up for successful independence.?.  I would hope that they though; perhaps even work with that former-member to establish their regular first-trade agreement to help cement their independence, as a warm-handoff.


[14-Mar-25 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	I would say coops like CAAP in AA do quite well espically if that happens at the lower level of a player's life mostly because you don't have to allocate 20 permits to making one thing but can get 20 permits worth a bases accross a lot of people


[14-Mar-25 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	so ultiamtely it depends on what is being made maybe?


[14-Mar-25 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	well, coops like CAAP aren't full sharing like FIOC-CAAP splits the end product proportionally to the effort

[16-Mar-25 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Evening folks, a quick governance update... I'll shortly be submitting a motion to increase taxes as unfortunately the current income is quite far off covering the cost of providing upkeep goods. I'm going to explore what options there may be to upgrade pop infra to make things more efficient, but an increase is a bit unavoidable. For awareness, the income per week is approximately 600k, whereas the calculated cost of upkeep is approximately 1,100k based upon average CX prices.


[16-Mar-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	so about a doubling of taxes?


[16-Mar-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	go for it, taxes currently are a rounding error


[16-Mar-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	It won't double. I'm going to make a more modest initial adjustment, and see if I can sort out some reductions in costs.


[16-Mar-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	smh there goes the government, raising taxes on the hardworking intergalactic corporation


[16-Mar-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	UTS, for example, has increased a lot in cost, there's a lack of production. So I've built a base to increase the general supply.


[16-Mar-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	So I think there's some artifical inflation in the CX averages for a few of the goods.


[16-Mar-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	feia, it currently costs me 6 AIC in taxes to make 4 units of AL. it costs me more than that to move it back to ANT


[16-Mar-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I think the true run costs may be closer to 800-900k


[16-Mar-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	this is why i voted for bush smh


[16-Mar-25 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i kinda saw this coming when rise said he was leaving


[16-Mar-25 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i'm expecting a lot of taxes to go up across ANT, as well as prices of gov consumables


[16-Mar-25 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I think realistically he was supplying a lot of planets using very vertically integrated production. We've lost that production, so until the supply increases... the costs will likely go up, particularly in more niche goods for larger planets.


[16-Mar-25 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	yes


[16-Mar-25 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	his internal pricing was....


[16-Mar-25 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	very low


[16-Mar-25 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I'd rather pin things to the CX, and provide more transparency on the demand, and create more of a market for those goods via the CX... creating opportunities for anyone to contribute.


[16-Mar-25 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	imo tax income should be higher than consumables. need some way to pay for infrastructure upgrades, and once upgrades are completely done, taxes can be redirected to other planets in the local area for development


[16-Mar-25 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	trying to match consumption exactly or undershooting is just shooting yourself in the foot, imo


[16-Mar-25 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	well but cheun wasn't talking about upkeep tanda, they were talking about infrastructure upgrades.


[16-Mar-25 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	just get us to a point where we can subsist, then redirect focus to planets like vulcan


[16-Mar-25 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	we aren't even at a point where we can subsist


[16-Mar-25 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	so people like yourself who are against tax increases would starve the planet, and also allow for no ability to react to changing market conditions


[16-Mar-25 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	cheun, relax, i was making a joke earlier


[16-Mar-25 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	the crux of what i'm saying is that rather than focusing on funding growth on a planet with no plots available, we should focus exclusively on getting taxes to a point where we can subsist.


[16-Mar-25 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	makes no sense to be discussing infrastructure upgrades that benefit no one


[16-Mar-25 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	if you have a healthy margin over costs, then after a while you have a stockpile of cash that does nothing. you can either enrich the gov with that, or spend it on infrastructure upgrades


[16-Mar-25 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Feia**:	Rather than sitting on a pile of cash that's doing nothing, why not focus on creating self-sustaining tax plans on planets that actually have room for growth?


[16-Mar-25 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	like vulcan or Agamemnon


[16-Mar-25 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	if you overtax deimos and funnel money to support growth on vulcan, you're basically using our tax money to fund our direct market competition.


[16-Mar-25 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	competition? That's an...odd way of talking about a planet you can put a base on as well as Deimos


[16-Mar-25 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	are you saying that metallurgy planets primarily producing aluminum aren't directly competing with each other?


[16-Mar-25 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Feia**:	I thought the whole point of investing in planet infrastructure was to attract new players


[16-Mar-25 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	vulcan shouldn't be really producing AL


[16-Mar-25 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	no, population infrastructure isn't to just attract new players. it's to support more players, more higher end goods, and to offer more options to planetary upkeep


[16-Mar-25 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Finest_One**:	I would reccomend MHP in the Art Gallery competitive pricing for where UTS, Also Finishing ARt Cafe Upgrade (DEC expensive and already submitted) and filling the DW is quite cost efficient  is right now.

[17-Mar-25 03:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	If you start feeding MHP into the Art Gallery that increases the daily costs by almost 50k, and results in culture being capped by comfort.


[17-Mar-25 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	And to address an earlier point there may still occasionally be a need for funds to complete upgrades where the distribution of population changes. e.g. increased demand for eng/tech can drive upgrade requirements if you're to keep ongoing upkeep lower.


[17-Mar-25 03:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	So it's somewhat prudent to. have a modest buffer for that purpose, even if excluding the possibility of cross funding pop upgrades on other planets.


[17-Mar-25 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptColeslaw**:	yeah population needs don't get capped when the planet fills up. Needs are calculated by total workforce, so if more bases are build by new players, going over the plot max, then POPI needs will also still increase to maintain that workforce. And like Akyan said, shifts in those workforces affect needs too. A lot can change, and planets this big get expensive


[17-Mar-25 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	For now the plan is to make some changes to the tax rates, and see what effect it has.. will have to tune them a few times I suspect (potentially up and down) to get the right balance.

As Scoosh Industries switches to the second best option, expect a change in our shipment sizes/payouts. Thank you for your hard work.

[31-Mar-25 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	first, make sure you have enough capacity.  if not, you need to build more habitation buildings


[31-Mar-25 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if you have enough capacity, then you have to check if the planet itself has available workers


[31-Mar-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**EvoV**:	ATTN Gov - If you're not careful there'll be an Engineer Pop drop.


[13-Apr-25 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	@Akyan, if taxes are still not supporting the planet, please increase taxes further on higher pops


[13-Apr-25 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Hi folks,


[13-Apr-25 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I'm taking a few actions following a review this weekend. The four actions are as follows:


[13-Apr-25 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	- I've submitted a motion to run a festivals programme to stabilise the population attrition, particularly for ENG.


[13-Apr-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	- Shipped the first of what will likely be a series of POPI upgrades, starting with upgrading the ART to increase culture production that'll uncap the education.


[13-Apr-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	- Increasing the taxes again to try and get them closer to funding the upkeep and try to build some funds for pop upgrades.


[13-Apr-25 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Finally I'm considering creating a planetary governance tracker, as I once did for Hyalos to provide a bit more transparency. See an example here: https://ingenious.foo/hyalos. Interested in feedback on this idea.

[13-Apr-25 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'm all for tax revision to be self-sustaining with a built in margin for eventual upgrades.


[13-Apr-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I like the tracker as well. The only thing I can think of that I might want to see out of it are the government account income/expense/balance figures and a breakdown of consumption by POPI building, but I also understand that that would more than double the workload for little benefit aside from looking at long term trends down the line.


[13-Apr-25 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	i'm not against it or anything, but will that really be useful to anyone? governing is pretty straightforward most of the time, you just supply the popi/cogc and pay yourself out, nobody will object to that as long as its going well


[13-Apr-25 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xflqr_**:	just looks like a lot of extra work for you, while people will just accept it the exact same anyways


[13-Apr-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Given that it's a starter planet, it might quickly put to bed some of the sorts that think governorship is just a grifting opportunity.


[13-Apr-25 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	Thank you @Akyan for your work! if you need assistant with shipping, let me know :)


[13-Apr-25 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	Yeah, it's not a common person to run across, but there are definitely some outspoken people who have never governed and just see it as the governor paying themselves out a bunch of money


[13-Apr-25 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I used to see that most on Harmonia

**aeltheos**:	I am just starting, but a governement budget reports sounds like a good way for beginner like me to understand how the administration work


[13-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	The 3 numbers I like to report whenever I'm doing gov stuff -> Last week's tax income. Weekly upkeep cost. Cash on hand.


[13-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	I think with those 3 numbers reported each, it keeps the finances transparent and lets you do whatever you need to do as a gov without having to get bogged down with sharing/reporting too much detail.

[14-Apr-25 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shakk**:	oh the humanity


[14-Apr-25 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	or 4.5 AIC per unit of AL.  given that it costs about 450 AIC to produce that unit of AL, this is about a 1% tax


[14-Apr-25 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Just to provide a bit of context. The tax income per week is around 780k AIC. I just contributed 1.5m in upkeep goods for the COGC / POPi.


[14-Apr-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	It's fairly common for the weekly contributions to exceed 1m. I'd be keen to tune down the taxes if it turns out they're excessive relative to the costs, but we weren't in that position with the prior tax configuration.


[14-Apr-25 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm of the opinion that governments should always run a tiny surplus


[14-Apr-25 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	let's normalise profitable goverments already


[14-Apr-25 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jcheung9941**:	i'm of the opinion of a healthy surplus, enough to cover infrastructure upgrades


[14-Apr-25 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Apr-25 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lapras**:	I am the original person wwho made the tax comment:


[14-Apr-25 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-25 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Are _you_ a new Deimos citizen watching your meager workforce struggle to pry ore out of the ground with their fingers? Filling balloons with dilute O2? Sitting on rocks hoping to smelt them with body heat? Have you ever thought to yourself, "Oh, if only I could transform that dirt to construction materials with the power of friendship?"


[15-Apr-25 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If so, the DNPC may be just for you! It's a production cooperative that mines & refines on Deimos and turns those goods into BBH and BSE, which are split between the members as payout. We're currently looking for someone to take over a ALO/O mining operation on Deimos!


[15-Apr-25 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Must have pro, as transactions are handled by contracts. Expectations are that you supply the workforce consumables, but no ALO/O transport is required, so overhead is low. PM me or just ask if you're interested/have questions.


[15-Apr-25 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Katinga**:	You have to sign the contract in blood, too


[23-Apr-25 06:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarauderW**:	TFIN recommends signing without looking at the underlining 34 page disclosure agreement, in order to save time! TFIN: Just sign it, if it was important, the font would be bigger!

**Akyan**:	Evening folks, I've again updated the governance tracker with the financials from the last week: https://oogcapitalmanagement.com/r/deimos


[28-Apr-25 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Income: 958k, Outgoings 1,500k, Cash Balance: 930k, Debit: 2,562.


[28-Apr-25 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I'm not minded to make further tax changes at this point to deal with the deficit, as we're soon to have a balance patch that will reduce the upkeep costs. This should enable the debt to repaid, but will see when it hits.


[29-Apr-25 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarauderW**:	Akyan, is there any chance we can make the COG from metallurgy to resource extraction?


[29-Apr-25 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarauderW**:	nevermind I am the only one who wants it xD


[29-Apr-25 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	Why should we? Lots of established Metallurgy industry here.


[29-Apr-25 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dyeus_Phter**:	You can vote on each COGC. If you managed to convince enough voters or everyone else forgot to vote you COULD change COGC to resource extraction


[29-Apr-25 07:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	indeed, it's possible to change cogc, but it's quite hard in practice


[29-Apr-25 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	if you're in need of a good ALO location that IS resource extraction, you need to go to Nascent


[29-Apr-25 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	It has exactly what you need


[29-Apr-25 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarauderW**:	Thanks everyone, Tanda!

**MrPoncho**:	hi there, this planet was an advice for starting a farm. is it true?


[30-Apr-25 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	the production time is higher


[30-Apr-25 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	far higher


[30-Apr-25 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	Nah, this isn't a good farming planet...


[30-Apr-25 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	It's good for smelting metals


[30-Apr-25 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	Many starter players start here with the ALO -> AL chain


[30-Apr-25 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Willger**:	^^ Deimos is a metalurgy planet, you get bonus at metalurgy, you can put up a farm here but I do not recommend it


[30-Apr-25 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	ok thx


[30-Apr-25 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Akyan**:	Harmonia it the best spot for a starter farm planet in ANT space


[30-Apr-25 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenver**:	This game seems pretty slow paced just starting off. Is that an accurate representation of the normal game play? I guess I'm used to mobile games that try to suck you in with quick activity at the start then slow down.


[30-Apr-25 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	this one starts slow, then gives you more as you grow


[30-Apr-25 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	of course, if you wanna go fast other players will loan you credits to expand


[30-Apr-25 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Flowers**:	if im making metal should i make an extractor for the oxygen or just buy oxygen?


[30-Apr-25 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	While Deimos's oxygen levels are profitable, it's probably more profitable for you to focus on making more metal


[30-Apr-25 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Flowers**:	ty


[30-Apr-25 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	and since you are probably heading to planet with a mostly empty ship, it's not putting undue strain on your logistics to just buy the O2

**MrPoncho**:	hi there, need some help: my ship goes to antares 1 comodety exc. if i trade some goods there and my ship is not there, its not a prob?


[01-May-25 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	have to pay storrage tax or so?


[01-May-25 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	@MrPoncho you can rent warehouse space at ANT, put this command into a buffer: WAR ANT


[01-May-25 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**zillatron**:	if you don’t have a warehouse or a ship there, the goods will get stored in a contract automatically


[01-May-25 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i have a q:


[01-May-25 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	all employees who consume consumer goods, or only those who are effectively employed. I have 200 pioneers, but only 110 of them are in production


[01-May-25 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	oh thx, so i wait till the ship ist there before i trade goods.


[01-May-25 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	i didnt noticed its the same chat :D


[01-May-25 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	If you buy something at the CX, and you don't a ship docked or warehouse storage rented, then you'll receive a contract with the bought materials you can pickup later.


[01-May-25 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	;P


[01-May-25 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	Ah, @Zillatron beat me to it


[01-May-25 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	As far as I know all employed workers will consume goods. But you shouldn't employ more then you need


[01-May-25 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	Even if you're production line isn't making anything, the workers still need food, water and clothes


[01-May-25 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrPoncho**:	thx, Pxlfox, But only the number that are actually employed or needed on the production line


[01-May-25 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	You should have in your workforce overview the required (what your production line needs), the current (what you actually employed) and the capacity (how much you could fit with the habitats you build).


[01-May-25 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pxlfox**:	The current workforce is what consumes goofd.


[01-May-25 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
