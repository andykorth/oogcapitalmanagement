Hey guys, as the corp expands I figured it would make things easier to have our own discord. I will post the link in game as well for new members to join

@everyone 

Hello OOG members. Everyone is here except for Earthling who doesnt use discord. I will show them this message personally so we are all in the loop.

Current state of the corporation:

DLR ---------- Phobos with FRM, FP, EXT, INC output (POL planned, several weeks out)

Earthling ---- Phobos with PP1 output (BMP in near future)

Figaro ------- Phobos with PP1 and PP2 output

Insnesless --- Deimos with PP2 output (PP3 planned, several weeks out)

MegaSaberEXE - Deimos with FRM output

Tadabe ------- Harmonia with FP, FRM output (HYF in near future)

As you can see we are heavy into PP1/PP2 with some FP/agriculture support.
It is important to note that all of our PP1/PP2 bases also operate a SME so they can make their own metal. My Carbon output is reserved 100% for corporate smelters to keep them running.


Short term planning (within 30 days):

- Earthling will be making a BMP on phobos within 3-4 days which will give us lots of flexibility, cheap OVE, etc. It also introduces demand for Hydrogen gas.

- Tadabe is hurrying to get an HYF up on Harmonia in order to produce coffee and other goodies

- With the PP2 outputs, we are very close to being vertical into new base building. The only thing we lack is POL -> PPF to make PSL for the core module of a new base. If anyone is interested in operating a PPF (3D printer), this is an option that would streamline our base building, but honestly I dont know that it will be profitable on its own.

Without a PPF, I will need to swing bulk trades of PG for PSL with the ANTS members who have existing PPF buildings on phobos. This will work but they will almost certainly jack the prices on me. Regardless, I will be making a POL on phobos ASAP to get a PG stockpile running. Today I build 3 buildings (HB1, FRM, FP) and then its off to HB2 + POL


Long term planning (30+ days): 

Insnesless will be going for a PP3 on Deimos. I dont know his exact timeline but its close to the 30-40 day mark. Feel free to update below.


[18-Jun-21 03:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think it is time to have a serious discussion of where to settle new bases. First up is the reality that we cant realistically afford low temperature worlds without going into considerable debt. This is an option but I dont think the corp can supply the loan for INS, and we dont have the means to produce it.

Also, High temperature, High pressure, High gravity are not possible for anyone in the game right now. The supplies simply dont exist yet.

This leaves normal rocky planets like we are all currently on, or any combination of:

    Gas planet --- AEF
    Low pressure - SEA
    Low gravity -- MGC

With these constraints, Here are my preferred planets and my reasoning for each:

Harmonia -- Easy, local, plenty of food and water, existing corporate trade route due to Tadabe and his coffee situation

KI-840c --- 5 jumps from phobos with magnesium and copper, as well as BRM and some Galerite, Extractors only

WR-681b --- 9 jumps (far) low pressure, lots of copper and some higher tier rare items. Extractor and Collector only.

Etherwind - Tadabe's favorite, best water output available.

Nike ------ Local, low pressure limestone planet. Local market already built.    

Allowing for low temperature, we get some really cool shit if we can somehow get our hands on THF -> INS

    KI-401b -- Titanium, Zirconium, Iron
    ZV-639d -- Nitrogen
    AJ-293g -- Fast Fuel

Feel free to throw in your two cents, thanks for reading.


[18-Jun-21 03:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Oh, also there is a really excellent low temperature planet nearby recently settled by ANTS:

KI-401b


[18-Jun-21 04:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
2COL gas collector base special material costs on low temp + low pressure gas planet:

CM  = 25 area = 250 INS, 25 SEA, 9 AEF
COL = 15 area = 150 INS, 15 SEA, 5 AEF
HB1 = 10 area = 100 INS, 10 SEA, 4 AEF

1 CRM + 2 COL + 1 HB1 = 650 INS, 65 SEA, 23 AEF

Idk know much but Nike looks interesting cause of the Limestone, which currently looks like theres a duopoly. Limestone is also crucial for all our prefabs. And its convenient being so close with a LM.


[18-Jun-21 09:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I agree, and it only requires sealant, which we can can produce entirely on our own if we buy SCR or S


[18-Jun-21 09:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think a constructor should go for it, its a situation where you can supply your own BSE


[18-Jun-21 09:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
only build extractors on Nike, BSE, SEA, MCG only, and you can make both of those items on phobos if you export the LST and buy SCR


[18-Jun-21 10:59 PM] figaro0714#0000
Maybe that's something i should start working on


[19-Jun-21 08:35 PM] insensless72#0000
Figaro, if youre going PP3 im going to rush Nike, its only 1 jump from me and i could do it quickly


[19-Jun-21 08:35 PM] insensless72#0000
that way all us constructors have a LST supply internally


[19-Jun-21 09:50 PM] figaro0714#0000
I think i will be going PP3, so u can go Nike


[20-Jun-21 09:52 AM] insensless72#0000
Sending 140 ALO to the Exchange later today unless someone wants it. Lmk if you anything shipped MegaSaber


[20-Jun-21 01:42 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Thanks for the offer Insensless. I'm good


[27-Jun-21 08:59 PM] insensless72#0000
Update on the expansion to Nike. I have the 8 TRU, and 4 LTA needed. Im in the process of buying enough resources to produce 2/4 LDE needed. INS and SEA are going to be an issue monetarily. Im working on stacking enough capital to try and resolve that. MCG is easy and that will be the last step. I am hoping to expand within the next 2 weeks


[27-Jun-21 09:00 PM] insensless72#0000
@bitcoin_ape Does Earthling have a BMP?


[27-Jun-21 11:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes


[27-Jun-21 11:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You dont need INS to settle on Nike, only SEA


[27-Jun-21 11:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and MCG like normal


[27-Jun-21 11:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling has a BMP


[28-Jun-21 02:21 PM] insensless72#0000
Youre right its PSL


[28-Jun-21 02:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Next on my list is bringing this POL online to start getting PG for those


[28-Jun-21 02:31 PM] insensless72#0000
Im in the process of buying 100 MCG from Earthling so in that exchange ill give you that BTA


[28-Jun-21 02:32 PM] insensless72#0000
@figaro0714 If you need anything from Deimos I could provide that to you as well


[28-Jun-21 02:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Im still a ways off. You may be able to get enough cash to make it happen before I even get this POL running


[28-Jun-21 02:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Figaro is about to supply me with the LBH but i still need a decent amount of BFABs + repair my RIGs with 12 BSE


[28-Jun-21 02:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It will happen, things are moving faster now


[28-Jun-21 02:49 PM] insensless72#0000
How many BFABs? I keep BSE and BBH in constant production


[28-Jun-21 02:50 PM] insensless72#0000
I know you have 2 PP1 on planet though


[28-Jun-21 03:00 PM] figaro0714#0000
@insensless72 thanks for asking but I'm good for now


[28-Jun-21 03:00 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape i have 12 bse if u need


[28-Jun-21 03:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is what I need to start running POL including HB2:

6 BSE
6 BDE
2 BTA
2 BBH


[28-Jun-21 03:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Figaro money is the issue. I need time.


[28-Jun-21 03:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can barely afford the 8 LBH, but I will buy them now as discussed and worry about the BFABs later since they are easier to get

@everyone updates on corporation strategy, structure, etc. coming tomorrow. Nice work getting all of these new buildings online, we now have 5/7 players with settler buildings and the ones not in settlers will be filling critical roles with pioneers üôÇ


[30-Jul-21 04:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Alright everyone, thanks for the patience and again congratulations to you all on scaling up and finding your profit margins wherever they may be


Now is a good time for us to look at our long term strategy and draw a cohesive plan for the whole corporation moving forward. Ill keep it short here and we can have extended discussion in the new strategy channel on this server.


1. It will be important to settle a cold nitrogen planet, either myself or @figaro0714  are best suited for this endeavor, but maybe @kimmyjiko is secretly loaded with cash.

    - Super long term I can see us moving into titanium, PP4, advanced metal manufacturing on Phobos/Deimos and feeding into the shipbuilding industry which is where all of the rich guys will be throwing money at us.


2. I want to continue to add corporation members, but it is getting a little difficult to coordinate everything on my own while still teaching new players. This leads me to point 3

3. I would like to open up some semi-formal positions within our ranks:

    - Logistics Coordinator
    - Public Relations Officer
    - Market Analyst

These roles are voluntary, they would help us greatly, and come with the ability to make friends and influence people üòÑ 
It will take a burden off of my shoulders and allow me to recruit more without fear of neglecting existing members. Open to suggestions here.


4. Ultimately I want us all to transition into settlers and technicians level buildings without sacrificing the bases of our supply chains (smelting, carbon, water, etc.)

This will allow us to stay self sufficient and take more money in from the market than we are collectively putting out. It is not bad to spend money on the big market, but it is preferable to sell into it üôÇ

So, without further ado:

- What do each of you want to do in game?

- Any interest in those positions from point #3?

- Anyone itching to get off of their starter planet? We can start making plans for this now.


[30-Jul-21 04:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone  ^^^^


[30-Jul-21 05:09 PM] sempyrfi#0000
@bitcoin_ape What would public relations involve?


[30-Jul-21 06:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Effectively going on the UFO discord server and talking up new players, getting our name in politics channels for the planets we are on, offering to fill trade requests on behalf of the corp, etc.


[30-Jul-21 06:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also maybe pumping our stock in the in game chat channels üôÇ


[30-Jul-21 06:15 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I have a political favor from Slomo. If who ever becomes public relations. I can ask the favor be transfer to them. But Slomo won't do anything outrageous.


[30-Jul-21 06:17 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Also I have work mon-fri so I can't really be on that much. I'm perfectly fine on being a pack mule for the group. I just want to see where we will be in the future.

I also suffer from the mon-fri work disease


[30-Jul-21 06:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Part of why I am looking to delegate this stuff out. Anyways, none of it is critical, we can go on as is, but it would make me more comfortable adding players

Ask him to build you an incinerator?

He will be prying that conversation for information if I had to guess


[30-Jul-21 06:39 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I don't think he would give me that much money. I think it could be a good idea to use the favor to maybe get into his circle of people and expand our economic partners. Also yea he would probably ask more about the INC.

[30-Jul-21 06:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[30-Jul-21 06:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It was Cyrius Patton of Tycho Manufacturing. Former Governor of phobos. He quit the game, and left the planet to his friend from ANTS which includes Slomes


[30-Jul-21 06:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
They approached me to have us build the Phobos Chamber of Global Commerce (cogc) but I declined because I wanted us all to build the stuff we just built.


[30-Jul-21 06:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Phobos and Deimos will want/need us to help build a cogc on both planets, Phobos first


[31-Jul-21 10:38 AM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape what would logistics coordinator do?


[31-Jul-21 10:55 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Basically we need to coordinate shipments in a few directions, and pack as many shipments into each cargo load as we can


[31-Jul-21 10:56 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also make sure one person doesnt have to do an in-ordinate amount of flying


[31-Jul-21 11:18 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also whenever we decide to do a large complicated trade with multiple ships or multiple stops, the logistics person would ideally have knowledge of where peoples ships and warehouses are located, and help facilitate the deal


[31-Jul-21 11:39 AM] sempyrfi#0000
@everyoneSpeaking of logistics, after MANY days of back and forth with @bitcoin_ape I COLIQ'd and I've relocated to Harmonia. FRM and INC are set up and will have a RIG in 2-3 days. If anyone has 8 BSE I can buy at less than market prices that would be fantastic but if not no worries. I have a transport at ANT currently and will be headed back to Harmonia todayüí™

Everyone that needs LST to function take the time to look this over. I literally cannot transport LST off Nike fast enough. I produce 210 every 3 days. Only 183 fit onto a ship. Therefore, if you are someone know needs LST for your recipes I will suggest this:\


[01-Aug-21 08:45 AM] insensless72#0000
1: Contact me and I can ship the LST to you directly, or


[01-Aug-21 08:46 AM] insensless72#0000
2: I can post ads on the Nike LM, which you can then accept and pick up woth your own ship. This this is the option you choose I would (or you could) figure out how much the fuel will cost for the round trip and cut it out of the total price


[02-Aug-21 01:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Welcome @spatial_piano !

Welcome @spatial_piano


[03-Aug-21 07:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Welcome @spatial_piano , happy to have you aboard.

As you have seen in game chat, we dont enforce any prices but we tend to give casual discounts in corp.

Insensless | Deimos Prefab has LST on Nike
Jarhead | Valor Industries has C on Harmonia

These might be useful trade considerations for your BMPs making MCG and PE. The LST is by the shipload with a discount if you pick it up or somehow arrange shipping


[03-Aug-21 09:43 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Welcome aboard @spatial_piano! Glad to have you


[04-Aug-21 11:55 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Thank you.


[04-Aug-21 08:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano there is 10 COF for 3500 on Phobos if you want to buy it


[04-Aug-21 11:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I got back from Hortus recently, so I'm good for a while.


[04-Aug-21 11:20 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Does anyone need H by the way? I'm returning from KI-401d with 500.


[05-Aug-21 01:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano I would like some Hydrogen! What are the price per unit?


[05-Aug-21 01:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Alternatively, if you want to give me H I can repay you over a week or so in the form of PG, since I will only use the hydrogen to make PG and you asked about buying some


[05-Aug-21 01:18 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Sounds good. I think 2H:13 PG is good ratio for trade. How much you need?


[05-Aug-21 01:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats fair. I will take as much as you are willing to give me. 2nd POL is coming online tomorrow and this would be a huge help


[05-Aug-21 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I produce carbon vertically and Magnesium is very cheap, so this would streamline everything and leave me some cash to land this THF buy


[05-Aug-21 01:21 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I think I'm fine selling half. I consume about 8 a day so 250 will last for a month for me


[05-Aug-21 01:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Fan-damn-tastic


[05-Aug-21 01:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
so that would translate to 1625 PG, ill call it 1700 to pay you for your troubles. It will take me some time to get all of that but I can pay in increments of 300 or something along those lines


[05-Aug-21 01:25 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I need only about 60/day, so if we say 200 as soon as you can + 300 every 5 days times 5


[05-Aug-21 01:25 PM] spatial_piano#0000
You can pay faster of course


[05-Aug-21 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 200 now. Post a buy on phobos LM for 200 PG@1AIC


[05-Aug-21 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will post a buy for 250 H@1AIC


[05-Aug-21 01:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and yea I will pay faster than that


[05-Aug-21 01:27 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Right, I'll need about 2-3 days to bring the load.


[05-Aug-21 01:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
No worries. you can still take the PG now and i will make my buy offer with a 5 day delivery

FIO has a Chrome app that sends data to FIOs database, and you can access that through the API

[08-Aug-21 07:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Currently we are 8. It could be useful to add 2 more


[08-Aug-21 08:02 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Is there such a thing as too many?


[08-Aug-21 08:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Only if it becomes unorganized. 10 is manageable I think


[08-Aug-21 08:14 PM] insensless72#0000
Could be useful but lets be specific about it based on corp needs


[08-Aug-21 08:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think there is an opening for metallurgy on Deimos, and more Agriculture/Food


[08-Aug-21 08:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Suggestions welcome. These will be low tech, new players most likely if we try to get any


[08-Aug-21 09:06 PM] figaro0714#0000
Sounds like a good idea, I agree with Insensless

Are we going to create a corporate hierarchy or something lol


[09-Aug-21 05:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It comes down to who is willing to do extra work, organizing information and staying on top of communications.


[09-Aug-21 05:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think organically we organize pretty well without me needing to impose much structure. Im guessing this would break down around 10-15 members


[10-Aug-21 02:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the game servers are down


[10-Aug-21 03:00 PM] spatial_piano#0000

[10-Aug-21 07:58 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ManoftheSea just told me that he has an AML and Piboy has one too.


[10-Aug-21 08:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So that is the highest tech building on Phobos and in Antares space right now


[10-Aug-21 08:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I also learned that Piboy is about to take a cold BER planet which unlocks TSH for high temperature worlds and unlocks some FTL ship building technology


[10-Aug-21 08:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Im considering some cold planets for my 2nd base, including:
```
QJ-382g..... Ammonia + Hydrogen
KI-401b..... FEO, TIO, LIO, ZIR
ZV-639d..... Nitrogen
```


[10-Aug-21 08:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
QJ is a fuel planet, KI gives us easy access to steel and titanium stuff, ZV allows nutrient solution which will turn @kimmyjiko into an in-game starbucks


[10-Aug-21 08:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone read the above for some info about where the game is going


[10-Aug-21 09:17 PM] insensless72#0000
Im thinking KI to fuel further expansion for Corp members


[10-Aug-21 09:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am also leaning towards KI, it gives us pathways into high tech industries, and would allow us to run titanium and steel through all of our smelters. I think we have 7-8 SME at this point which could lead into 1-2 ASM in corp


[10-Aug-21 09:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
The nitrogen would be profitable and coffee is great ‚òï  but would not unlock any technology chains in corp. 

The ammonia and hydrogen would probably be the most profitable, and ammonia unlocks some tech for us including fermentation, slow fuel refining, and some chemistry.


[11-Aug-21 09:03 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Base in KI would also allow for getting cheap H from 401d LM and ship it with metal or ores. You can get 193H and 307 TIO in one ship.


[11-Aug-21 11:10 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that is an excellent point @spatial_piano the proximity to the hydrogen planet had not even occurred to me


[14-Aug-21 04:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@here I have begun talking to `Alucard998 | LNG Inc` about joining OOG. He is an ALO/AL producer on Deimos and also has a base on Hermes and does fuel refining.

We are all growing quite well.


[14-Aug-21 04:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea, if you want to move away from Carbon and into Agriculture primarily then it would be good to recruit a carbon specialist


[14-Aug-21 04:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There is room for more than one. Our demand for food and carbon is only increasing


[14-Aug-21 04:43 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Not sure if I want to move away from Carbon. FRMs are just a natural progression I guess


[14-Aug-21 04:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
On harmonia especially it is easy to run a large vertical carbon setup. The distinction is how much of your resources are going to FRMs and their operation vs. INC and their operations, and also which experts you prioritize when you have more than 6 total


[14-Aug-21 04:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Really hard for you to go wrong either way, but im trying to figure out specifically who to recruit


[14-Aug-21 05:14 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Nice, I don't think we have a ALO or Fuel person right. Has he talk about his prices?


[14-Aug-21 05:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
quote from him:
‚ÄúWell, with the currently swelled market on pretty much everything, I've been using a rate of 315 or so. MotS and I used a lower rate, but it was reflected in the price of bfabs I was getting back, and we worked largely on accounted bartering. 

I'm filling my deimos base in the morning, so not looking for additional bfabs at the moment, but I'm comfortable saying 300 for the time being, if buying a good quantity. My supply is spoken for for the next 3 days or so‚Äù


[14-Aug-21 05:18 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see, thats pretty good.


[14-Aug-21 05:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh the above is for AL specifically. We could probably get him down to 280 with a large order, depending on markets.


[14-Aug-21 05:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 if you want some AL from Deimos you can get in on this bulk order. Also I have your 10500 for Argon


[14-Aug-21 06:08 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape I'm good on AL for a while. We can incorporate the 10500 into the price of the INS once u buy all 1200. Unless u want to do it this way, but I'm not in need of any cash rn.


[14-Aug-21 06:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
thats fine, if you prefer it in cash at the INS trade I will hold on to it.


[14-Aug-21 06:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I dont currently have plans for another Deimos trip after this so it could be a while before there is another bulk AL buy


[14-Aug-21 06:16 PM] figaro0714#0000
I still got a week of ALO to smelt so I'll be good

[19-Aug-21 11:49 PM] colerror#0000
If anyone needs Carbon, let me know somewhat soon, I need to post it up otherwise to afford some RAT


[19-Aug-21 11:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You should take advantage of high prices outside of the corp. You could sell on the LM at 300+ per carbon


[19-Aug-21 11:50 PM] figaro0714#0000
True, I'm heading to CX rn if u want me to ship it


[19-Aug-21 11:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

If ur in urgent need I'm willing to buy all 60 at a discount.


[19-Aug-21 11:54 PM] colerror#0000
Not too urgent, I'm 3 days from out of RAT


[19-Aug-21 11:55 PM] figaro0714#0000
Then it's probably just better to wait and see if sells on CX


[19-Aug-21 11:59 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, posted it up at 310. Price has dropped on it this week, but that's still not bad

Glad to have you @colerror


[20-Aug-21 11:08 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Alright @everyone corp weekend update coming up when i finish work today. stay tuned


[20-Aug-21 11:32 AM] sempyrfi#0000
@colerror Welcome aboard!


[20-Aug-21 01:33 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@colerror Welcome. I currently run my PE production on my own INC, but I'm expanding soon, so I may start buying extra.


[20-Aug-21 01:35 PM] colerror#0000
Yea. Just sold what I had, but picked up some PWO so production should be a bit better. Looks like I need a fair bit of money before I can scale too much more, but working on it


[20-Aug-21 01:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It accelerates as you add more production buildings. I think you are in a good spot considering your account age


[20-Aug-21 01:38 PM] colerror#0000
Yea, 12k in cash after this CX trip, and shouldn't need consumables for a couple weeks. Looking like my shopping list is about 60k at market rate to double production


[20-Aug-21 01:39 PM] spatial_piano#0000
When you need more PWO, OVE or MCG I can sell at discount.


[20-Aug-21 01:39 PM] colerror#0000
Nice, I'll let you know


[20-Aug-21 01:40 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I expect prefab prices to fall over the next 2 weeks.


[20-Aug-21 01:40 PM] sempyrfi#0000

[20-Aug-21 01:41 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Nooooooooooooo


[20-Aug-21 01:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Before this rush of new players carbon was mostly stable between 240 and 280 on the CX


[20-Aug-21 01:41 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Im in a bidding war for pennies rn üôÑ


[20-Aug-21 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but BFABs were also much lower in cost, so it was not so bad


[20-Aug-21 01:42 PM] colerror#0000
Ah, I joined with the rush, so I've been seeing 300 regularly


[20-Aug-21 01:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Carbon demand trails prefab* demand, since it is needed to make plastics and metals which are then processed into prefabs*


[20-Aug-21 01:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If prefab prices/demand spike, then everyone collectively burns up the carbon supply in order to fill prefab demand, and you end up with downstream carbon price spikes since there is less carbon available across the board


[20-Aug-21 01:44 PM] sempyrfi#0000
Yup


[20-Aug-21 01:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
same thing works in reverse

Wait your on phobos right, I'm about to land on phobos to fullfill a contract with earthling. Maybe you don't need to ship it to me and i can just land and pay and pick it up.


[20-Aug-21 03:29 PM] spatial_piano#0000
That sounds good to me. I got 60 I can sell right now. Do you need anything else


[20-Aug-21 03:31 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I plan on getting my COF from tadabe, so i should be good. Thanks for the offer thou. Will 6300 be enough for 30 PWO, the lowest on the market is 200 but I'm willing to pay 210 for each.


[20-Aug-21 03:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
The LM price on Phobos is 150 currently, I wouldn't feel right taking more than that.


[20-Aug-21 03:37 PM] megasaberexe#0000
So 4500 for 30 PWO, really? Wow that would be great. It's a deal.


[20-Aug-21 03:37 PM] megasaberexe#0000

[20-Aug-21 03:58 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Lolz me too


[20-Aug-21 08:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
OK @everyone, here is the update (wall of text sorry):

Earthling and I have the mats to make 1 core module each MCG and SEA (Sealant) for 1 normal base and 1 low-pressure base. @figaro0714 will have 1200 INS to sell me in about 1 week(?) which allows for a single cold low+pressure base and a standard one.

Im thinking I should take KI-401d and Earthling will settle Harmonia for vertical food industries. After I get an extractor up on this planet I will build more POL on phobos.

This base will primarily get TIO and FEO to make Titanium, Steel and Ferro Titanium. First sales go to corporate smelters, and we will have cheap steel on Phobos for BMPs and Figaros PP3.


I think there is a good opportunity for a corporation member to settle on QJ-382c (cold gas planet) since we now have the technology in corp. It would require the base-builder to pay the cost in AIC of the core module + INS + AEF.

üòé 

[20-Aug-21 08:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If anyone can afford the expense within about ~2-3 weeks time frame, we should talk about getting a core module in production for you because it is a slow process.

Next.. we should all remember to check the Chamber of Commerce on your planet, and we can look at throwing our weight around a little with coordinated voting there and in planet elections. Open for discussion!


Last item... I am still looking for a logistics coordinator in corp. Totally optional im not sure how hard it would be, but you would probably get even more free shipping.


[20-Aug-21 08:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We can move some discussions to other channels to avoid flooding general more than I just did.

[01-Sep-21 05:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
repairing is necessary because your efficiency will drop to 30% otherwise


[01-Sep-21 05:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you let it happen your output will become extremely slow, and you will have to feed your workers the same amount. It is worth spending the money on repair bfabs in order to save the time and consumables


[01-Sep-21 05:59 PM] insensless72#0000
@megasaberexe If you need to repair I could easily get bfabs to Deimos. I dont let my buildings go below 80% before I repair

[05-Sep-21 12:04 PM] insensless72#0000
@figaro0714 I can make the BSE and BBH really cheap. The LSE would be a problem with no local source of cheap PG

[05-Sep-21 12:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oh I see. Sorry im messing this up. I now realize it makes more sense for @figaro0714 to make the LSE since Earthling is already doing the rest of that


[05-Sep-21 12:09 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So in that case the next 480 PG would go to figaro to make LSE and I will worry about paying Earthling back later.

Well the PG alone is gonna run you for 2k, and I don't think you can get TCL for under 200.


[14-Sep-21 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@spatial_piano Larsaal is a generalist, theres really no way to guess what he is doing with RDE


[14-Sep-21 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
oooooH LNG is alucard


[14-Sep-21 02:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
He has ABH too. I saw him buy NR about 10 days ago


[14-Sep-21 02:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Here all the information I got out of him


[14-Sep-21 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
```mememan ‚Äî 09/02/2021
Are you building an AML?

Alucard998 ‚Äî 09/02/2021
manofthesea has one

mememan ‚Äî 09/02/2021
I thought you were making ABH for another. I suppose there are other uses for ABH though :)

Alucard998 ‚Äî 09/02/2021
:zipper_mouth:
```


[14-Sep-21 02:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So he doesnt *deny* building an AML, but implies he is not.


[14-Sep-21 02:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Other than that, the only options would be Appliances Factory APF , 
or Advanced Appliances Factory AAF


[14-Sep-21 02:18 PM] spatial_piano#0000
AML would need the 6 Kevlar for ADE


[14-Sep-21 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Exactly. But so would the others


[14-Sep-21 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
AML makes more sense than the factories


[14-Sep-21 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
APF would unlock some planetary infrastructure and PDAs for engineers. Very tight market though unless he has a buyer in ANTs for something specific


[14-Sep-21 02:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 read the above. This is our latest corporate scouting info üïµÔ∏è

If theyre getting into afabs theyre close to shipyards

[14-Sep-21 07:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the best building to make with afabs (at first) is AML and ORC


[14-Sep-21 07:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We have the only shipyard in the whole game right next to phobos. It was included free at the start of the current game world. Anyone can use it if they land on that planet with shipbuilding materials


[15-Sep-21 11:18 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Heads up, PE price is starting to climb. Slomes bought at least 9k PE from PHO LM two days ago. I produce currently about 800/day so if you need some ping me.

@spatial_piano  Do you have any PWO for sell?


[17-Sep-21 04:12 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yes. I can sell 90@135/u


[17-Sep-21 05:24 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Wow only 135!  I'll take 30. Can you post a ad?


[17-Sep-21 05:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
mega are you flying to phobos?


[17-Sep-21 05:25 PM] megasaberexe#0000
No, i only go to CX to deimos and vice versa


[17-Sep-21 05:28 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I can post on Phobos, but how should I get the stuff to you?


[17-Sep-21 05:30 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I'm going to CX tomorrow if you need it hauled as well


[17-Sep-21 05:31 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Hmmmm, i'll just send a ship to phobos.


[17-Sep-21 05:32 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Ok. how much time do you need for pickup?


[17-Sep-21 05:33 PM] megasaberexe#0000
30 PWO, and do you make COF?


[17-Sep-21 05:33 PM] spatial_piano#0000
No I don't make COF.


[17-Sep-21 05:33 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay then I'll just get the PWO


[17-Sep-21 05:34 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Do you sell any DW or RAT BTW?


[17-Sep-21 05:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe if you are coming to phobos I might like to ship some aluminum from deimos


[17-Sep-21 05:35 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I do have like 60 extra DW and RAT in storage but the supplies are for insensless. Have you tried talking to earthling? I heard he is producing DW and RAT on a larger scale then me.


[17-Sep-21 05:36 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  I haven't got a SME yet, so is someone giving them to me or something?


[17-Sep-21 05:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Ah, no sellers lined up. dont worry about it this time


[17-Sep-21 05:39 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@megasaberexe Are you ready to pick the ad up?

[17-Sep-21 05:43 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  On deimos LM there is a person selling 100 AL ore for 11000 which is about 105 per ore. I could buy that and deliver it. The company name is Swift Mining Group, the corps name is FIO Corp - Antares, their code is SMG.  They are also online


[17-Sep-21 05:50 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape should i buy?


[17-Sep-21 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
nah its too expensive


[17-Sep-21 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i thought about it but i think 110 each is a bad price


[17-Sep-21 05:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i have a ship on deimos so its cool. make your moves while I wait for a better price üôÇ


[17-Sep-21 05:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000

[19-Sep-21 01:37 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Well the mystery of alucards Kevlar purchases just solved. He dropped a whole library on Phobos.


[19-Sep-21 02:48 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Wow so that is what around 200 days players can do.


[19-Sep-21 02:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, but alucard does financing with ANTS members. he got some of the hard materials on a loan of some sort


[19-Sep-21 02:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have no idea what the debt agreement looks like, but we saw him getting the KV, TCL acid, etc. for 1 AIC on the phobos markets

especially LAB, 12 LDE


[28-Sep-21 05:52 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@bitcoin_ape  I had contacted a player like 3 months ago and they replied to me

company name: Krazy Eats
158 days
Are we interested in them that could allow them to join us? They aren't in a corps yet.


[28-Sep-21 05:52 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I think they make RATs


[28-Sep-21 05:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Possibly, what planet are they on?


[28-Sep-21 05:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
karl like marx haha


[28-Sep-21 05:53 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Not sure, one sec


[28-Sep-21 05:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also we would want to know how many production buildings he has. For example if its RAT how many farms and FPs?


[28-Sep-21 05:55 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Can't find him, and don't really remember how i found him too. But i will go and ask him those questions


[28-Sep-21 05:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea. Rations could be nice but we need to make sure they are in our local area


[28-Sep-21 05:58 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Right right, okay just sent them those msgs. Right now they are offline so I'll probably get a reply from them tomorrow hopefully

100@1750 if you post


[06-Oct-21 06:21 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@spatial_piano I see, then can you hold until Friday? I'll be off on that day and can actually call my bank to do a international purchase for PRO


[07-Oct-21 01:33 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@megasaberexe  i can also post if we happen to be on at the same time, but the timing is a bit hard


[07-Oct-21 06:05 PM] insensless72#0000
@spatial_piano Ill also be in the market for MCG. I can buy Mega's MCG and hold it for better timing


[08-Oct-21 11:04 AM] megasaberexe#0000
Okay that sounds good, since tadabe is busy does anyone have COF to sell?


[09-Oct-21 12:57 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe coffee is short until tadabe gets his HYF running or until earthling can make an excess from 1 HYF


[09-Oct-21 12:58 PM] insensless72#0000
Im going to work on expanding into an HYF on Harmonia as well


[09-Oct-21 01:04 PM] megasaberexe#0000
I see, there is a seller on the market but they are from another faction and kinda expensive.


[09-Oct-21 01:58 PM] colerror#0000
Looking at building a CHP and HB2, anyone have materials handy for sale, or should I try my luck on the market?


[09-Oct-21 02:15 PM] insensless72#0000
I have fabs for you but theyre not local


[09-Oct-21 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
between Earthling and Figaro and MCG from mark, I think it could be built pretty quickly


[09-Oct-21 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 would you be able to sell 5 BSE and 5 BBH on phobos?


[09-Oct-21 02:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think I can convince earthling to sell 5 BDE and 2 BTA. I have the Truss currently on phobos


[09-Oct-21 02:29 PM] colerror#0000
Actually just bought it all in the market. Not much EXO or PT on the market though


[09-Oct-21 02:30 PM] spatial_piano#0000
I just bought AL and STL so I can make some if you need.


[09-Oct-21 02:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lol nice. Earthling has a few but mark probably can produce very fast


[09-Oct-21 02:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling can sell 10 of each


[09-Oct-21 02:36 PM] colerror#0000
Ok, that should be fine to get started.


[09-Oct-21 02:36 PM] spatial_piano#0000
They're on ANT still, so it might take until monday, but I have excess PT i can sell. I don't have that many EXO, but I can spare 5.


[09-Oct-21 02:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
wow PT situation is ugly


[09-Oct-21 02:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
price avg 599 but none have sold since monday


[09-Oct-21 02:49 PM] insensless72#0000
I could put down a BMP temporarily and start making PT from the STL I have


[09-Oct-21 02:50 PM] colerror#0000
I'm on ANT. If you want me to ship anything, I was gonna head out shortly


[09-Oct-21 02:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@insensless72 I would say charge people an arm and a leg for stl because they all want to sell PT at 600+


[09-Oct-21 02:52 PM] spatial_piano#0000
@colerror How much free tonnage do you have?


[09-Oct-21 02:53 PM] colerror#0000

[09-Oct-21 02:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@colerror how do these prices sound? 10 PT @4500aic and 10 EXO @1200aic


[09-Oct-21 02:56 PM] colerror#0000
Sounds fine. I don't have a lot of raw materials to start, need to get a ship full of carbon to the CX, so I just need enough to get started

Earthling will be doing a return trip from Deimos to phobos tonight @insensless72


[18-Oct-21 01:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you have fabs on deimos you could get them to phobos for free and worry about selling them on the LM at that point


[18-Oct-21 03:16 PM] insensless72#0000
Unfortunately I do not have them on Deimos


[18-Oct-21 03:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Well.. I guess its up to the next limestone shipper to grab them


[18-Oct-21 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
I'm going to send a ship to Phobos @colerror as soon as I can. I'll bring LST to dump on the LM


[18-Oct-21 04:09 PM] colerror#0000
Depending on how much you got, I might just buy that off you too


[18-Oct-21 04:10 PM] insensless72#0000
It should be around 180 after the fabs


[18-Oct-21 04:36 PM] insensless72#0000
Also, im in the process of making 110 PT if anyone needs for a more reasonable price


[18-Oct-21 06:44 PM] colerror#0000
Let me know how much for those parts


[20-Oct-21 02:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have a vertical carbon producer on Phobos who is interested in joining the corp.

It is WarpStreetBets. He seems very friendly and active.


[20-Oct-21 02:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I know we are heavy on carbon producers at the moment but he may be willing to transition into something based on carbon. @everyone

[20-Oct-21 04:37 PM] insensless72#0000
New growth could be good for us


[20-Oct-21 04:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats my thinking, also anyone in carbon over the past month is probably in a good position to expand


[20-Oct-21 06:12 PM] megasaberexe#0000
If only they was on deimos, then they could take my role and then I could move to another position that could help our supply chain.


[20-Oct-21 06:14 PM] megasaberexe#0000
Like do we have a person mining limestone?


[20-Oct-21 06:24 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We do, its your neighbor Insensless


[20-Oct-21 06:25 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@megasaberexe if you want to focus on expansion or change up your base we can talk, I dont want you to feel trapped in the carbon situation


[20-Oct-21 06:32 PM] megasaberexe#0000
No no, it nothing like that. I was just thinking of corps expansion. I'm complete fine staying in Carbon and stuff. @bitcoin_ape

@bitcoin_ape No problem, I wonder if recruiting people from different factions is on the table?

I have kept it off the table because I think it would become untenable unless they have bases on our planets. Also I worry about corporate spies üïµÔ∏è

Coordination and logistics is already quite difficult without roping in distant planets, multiple currencies, and of course burning a ton of fast fuel

I'm glad to join a team! I made too many mistakes trying to figure out what I'm doing XD


[28-Nov-21 07:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
That is fine. Most people end up doing a free restart (COLIQ) early on. It doesnt have much affect if you do it early after making various mistakes


[28-Nov-21 08:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is also possible to stick it out and be successful as myself and others in corp have done, but I think I would ultimately have grown faster if I restarted after 1 week.


[28-Nov-21 08:00 PM] sackless_jack#0000
That's good to hear. I don't think I'm at the point of needing to liquidate but, It would have been nice not doing shipping contracts at a lose haha


[28-Nov-21 08:01 PM] sackless_jack#0000
yeah


[28-Nov-21 08:03 PM] sackless_jack#0000
So what is this Corp in need of atm? I'm doing Carbon farming


[28-Nov-21 08:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
You are in a great position to do metallurgy on Deimos if you decided to stay there and not COLIQ


[28-Nov-21 08:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that would mean producing AL with a smelter, using the carbon that you already have


[28-Nov-21 08:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
aluminum is good, in the past we have had to buy large amounts from external sellers. Not a huge deal but it is inconvenient


[28-Nov-21 08:06 PM] insensless72#0000
What planet are you located on Airie?


[28-Nov-21 08:06 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Deimos


[28-Nov-21 08:07 PM] insensless72#0000
If youre in need of cash I can buy the C you have currently. My main base is on Deimos as well


[28-Nov-21 08:08 PM] insensless72#0000
C is not a bad market on Deimos considering its heavily specialized to metallurgy, but like DLR was saying, I would recommend further growth into ALO or SME


[28-Nov-21 08:09 PM] insensless72#0000
I think that currently I am the only other Corp member extracting ALO, so there is plenty of room there.


[28-Nov-21 08:11 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Ok, let me look up what ALO and SME is

[28-Nov-21 08:13 PM] insensless72#0000
Deimos has 3 resources naturally, ALO is one of them. It is found in the Ores tab on the market exchange


[28-Nov-21 08:14 PM] sackless_jack#0000
ok cool. Can you extract water? I bought some and shipped it to water my farms lol


[28-Nov-21 08:14 PM] sackless_jack#0000
also what is SME?

[28-Nov-21 08:19 PM] sackless_jack#0000
is there a hotkey to bring up a new buffer?


[28-Nov-21 08:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
there is a button at the very bottom left of the screen


[28-Nov-21 08:19 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Yeah! I see that


[28-Nov-21 08:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you cant see it, you need to hit the "BFRS" button on the left side


[28-Nov-21 08:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
same goes for the SCRNS menu which is at the top left.


[28-Nov-21 08:20 PM] insensless72#0000


[28-Nov-21 08:20 PM] sackless_jack#0000
I see that too


[28-Nov-21 08:22 PM] sackless_jack#0000
so If I wanted to extract ALO what does the production look like?


[28-Nov-21 08:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Build an extractor (EXT), and probably a HB1 to support the 60 pioneers.


[28-Nov-21 08:24 PM] insensless72#0000
Hold on Ill show you my production line


[28-Nov-21 08:24 PM] sackless_jack#0000
I have room for up to 300 pioneers currently


[28-Nov-21 08:25 PM] insensless72#0000
I Extract the ALO and smelt it into AL

you have plenty of room


[28-Nov-21 08:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Minimum is 1 EXT + 1 SME to extract ALO and smelt it. You would buy a small amount of oxygen in this case and use your own carbon. Oxygen is cheap, you will have no trouble buying it.


[28-Nov-21 08:33 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Interesting


[28-Nov-21 08:36 PM] insensless72#0000
You can stick with what you have, because C will be in demand on Deimos (ill buy it all from you) and you can expand into that, or you can start extracting ALO and move into metallurgy


[28-Nov-21 08:37 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Well I would love to do either one but I don't have a lot of cash. In a few hours another bath of Carbon will be done but I'll only have 8which is like 2k AIC


[28-Nov-21 08:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
how many Incinerators do you have?


[28-Nov-21 08:38 PM] sackless_jack#0000
2 and have half the prefabs for a 3rd


[28-Nov-21 08:39 PM] sackless_jack#0000
just missing 1 BSE 1. BTA and 2 BDE


[28-Nov-21 08:41 PM] insensless72#0000
My main focus is construction, Ill give you the supplies for an EXT and SME to see how it goes


[28-Nov-21 08:42 PM] sackless_jack#0000
oh wow that would be awesome


[28-Nov-21 08:44 PM] insensless72#0000
Ill get you what you need to finish the 3rd INC, a EXT, and SME and you only sell the C to me, sound good?


[28-Nov-21 08:48 PM] sackless_jack#0000
That does sound good, I would like to clarify a few things before officially agreeing. How much will I be selling you the Carbon for compared to market rate?


[28-Nov-21 09:00 PM] sackless_jack#0000
also looks like my workforce is 180/300, with a 3rd Incinerator, EXT and SME that would put me at 330/300. So I would need a fourth HB1 I believe


[28-Nov-21 09:03 PM] insensless72#0000
So the total for fabs is 26,700 with everything below market value, ill break that down for you if you want. ill pay market value or above if you need the cash right away for C


[28-Nov-21 09:05 PM] insensless72#0000
Im not interested in locking you into a deal or anything. After all, your production helps the corp grow. all I was askign right away is sell your local C to me so i can fuel my smelters

[28-Nov-21 09:32 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Awesome! Thanks again for your help! Glad to be apart of your Corp üôÇ


[28-Nov-21 09:33 PM] insensless72#0000
Nice having you!


[28-Nov-21 09:34 PM] insensless72#0000
If you have any questions just let any of us know, most of us are pretty experienced players. DLR being our fearless leader


[28-Nov-21 09:36 PM] sackless_jack#0000
I plan on it! the first 3 days after I signed up I had no idea what was going on lol


[28-Nov-21 09:36 PM] insensless72#0000
Yeah theres a pretty steep learning curve. The help videos for the game do a pretty good job. If you havent watched them you definitely should


[28-Nov-21 09:38 PM] sackless_jack#0000
I did, I think I watched all of them a few times. The help/tutorial buffers helped out a lot too!


[28-Nov-21 09:41 PM] insensless72#0000
The hardest part for me was figuring out how to set up individual screens, and figuring out what I needed on them. Once you have that down playing is easy


[28-Nov-21 09:42 PM] sackless_jack#0000
yeah! I haven't even really tried


[28-Nov-21 09:43 PM] sackless_jack#0000
maybe we can chat and do a screen share sometime. A little Corp tutorial or something


[28-Nov-21 09:44 PM] insensless72#0000
For sure, I can do my best to give a quick crash course now if you have a sec


[28-Nov-21 09:45 PM] sackless_jack#0000
yeah that sounds good!


[29-Nov-21 10:21 AM] sackless_jack#0000
I need some NCC for fuel to get my ship home. Anyone wanna trade NCC for AIC?


[29-Nov-21 10:25 AM] sackless_jack#0000
Actually I have some Carbon to sell to @insensless72. I'm sure he will be able to get me some NCC


[29-Nov-21 10:26 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have never traded in NCC, otherwise I would happily help. You are out at moria with no fuel?


[29-Nov-21 10:26 AM] sackless_jack#0000
yup üôÉ


[29-Nov-21 05:54 PM] insensless72#0000
@sackless_jack I do not know how to get NCC to be honest with you. I have a ship at the station I can send with fuel to get you home


[29-Nov-21 05:55 PM] megasaberexe#0000
@sackless_jack  Welcome Airie!


[29-Nov-21 06:08 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Hey @insensless72 that would be great XD I put up a foreign exchange order but no bites just yet


[29-Nov-21 06:08 PM] sackless_jack#0000
@megasaberexe Thanks! It's good to be here


[29-Nov-21 06:12 PM] sackless_jack#0000
@insensless72 wait, you already have a ship at Moria Station? Or you would send a ship to Moria. I would hate to make you come all the way out just to save me >.<


[29-Nov-21 06:14 PM] insensless72#0000
I have a ship at the Antares Station. I will have to send it out to save you with enough fuel to get you home. alternatively, I can provide you the fuel on Deimos so you can send your second ship to get your first


[29-Nov-21 06:15 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Hmmm I think waiting for my foreign exchange to go through would be best. then I could buy enough fuel to get to Antares


[29-Nov-21 06:16 PM] insensless72#0000
Cool! let me know how that works, ive never done it before


[29-Nov-21 06:16 PM] sackless_jack#0000
and if anyone here wants to trade 1k AIC for 1k NCC that would help too


[29-Nov-21 06:16 PM] sackless_jack#0000
will do!


[29-Nov-21 06:20 PM] insensless72#0000
Since our corp is located in the Antares region, all corp members have AIC. Just so you know for the future, if you go to any base other than Antares they use different forms of currency


[29-Nov-21 06:21 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Yeah! I have had a few foreign exchanges go through so far so I have had the chance to use a few besidees AIC


[29-Nov-21 06:23 PM] insensless72#0000
Nice!


[29-Nov-21 07:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sackless_jack we will rescue your ship tonight one way or another. I know a few ways to fix this


[29-Nov-21 07:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
did you get any NCC or fuel yet?


[29-Nov-21 07:20 PM] insensless72#0000
Only fuel but ill use it


[29-Nov-21 08:06 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@sackless_jack transferred 995 NCC to you via the FX currency exchange


[29-Nov-21 08:49 PM] sackless_jack#0000
oh sweet thanks @bitcoin_ape ! I got the NCC. Going to buy fuel now


[29-Nov-21 08:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is a low liquidity currency pair due to how distant the exchanges are and that NCC is a larger economy than AIC.


[29-Nov-21 08:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I had to go through AIC-> CIS  and then CIS -> NCC which worked nicely because I had some leftover CIS to cover fees from an old trade.


[29-Nov-21 09:08 PM] sackless_jack#0000
Nice

[21-Dec-21 02:53 AM] domicius#0000
Also, do we have any breakdown of what we're all making somewhere? Like a Google sheet or something?


[21-Dec-21 06:08 AM] insensless72#0000


[21-Dec-21 06:58 AM] insensless72#0000
Welcome Domicius! I may have some things for you to fly to Deimos for me, I'll let you know but the end of today. We are a pretty diverse Corp so far, I'll let @everyone explain their setup for you. I am located on Nike, Deimos, and Harmonia. I specialize in fab production, and I dabble in metallurgy and consumables. Let me know if you need help expanding!


[21-Dec-21 07:35 AM] domicius#0000
Great - thanks Insensless. Just set up an ad and let me know the deets. Im about 24 hours out from touchdown on Phobos and loading up. I need about 150tn/50m3 for my own stuff.


[21-Dec-21 10:33 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@domicius welcome. My largest base is on Phobos and focuses mainly on Chemicals (polymer plants + CHP). I have an extraction base on a remote planet and a new construction base on Nike in Antares area.


[21-Dec-21 10:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have posted our production spreadsheet in the strategy channel. As you can see we have no electronics buildings in corp. You are on the best electronics planet (Phobos) so its a good option for you to specialize in


[21-Dec-21 11:08 AM] spatial_piano#0000
@domicius Welcome. I'm the other manufacturer in corp, with a side of refining. My main base is Phobos, and I have bases on Nike and QJ-382g. My main products are MCG, PE, SF, H, AMM and whatever you need from PPF or WPL. I also recently started making BDEs on Nike, but on Phobos it's probably easier to buy those from Earthling.

Did you guys know that nobody is selling TS in AI1?


[22-Dec-21 11:56 AM] domicius#0000
It's required for AL.


[22-Dec-21 11:56 AM] domicius#0000
Which goes into Clean Room prod


[22-Dec-21 12:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
TS is hard to find because it is normally on extreme planets. It isnt required for AL though, we have an abundance of AL locally through Deimos


[22-Dec-21 12:45 PM] domicius#0000
Does it come out of the ground as AL or ALO?


[22-Dec-21 12:48 PM] insensless72#0000
Yes it does Domicius, but you shouldnt need it. Its not even being sold on market yet


[22-Dec-21 12:49 PM] insensless72#0000
Easiest way to AL is ALO + C + O


[22-Dec-21 01:10 PM] domicius#0000
Just checking what all goes into a CLR


[22-Dec-21 01:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ALO comes from ground, AL is refined from ALO

[23-Dec-21 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Reach out and see what they have to say. Could be they know each other irl and wouldnt be interested


[23-Dec-21 04:09 PM] insensless72#0000
Could also be a quick +3 for us


[23-Dec-21 04:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Happy to do an intro or whatever you require.


[23-Dec-21 04:11 PM] insensless72#0000
You could offer them a free building (settler level max) to each if they join, I could pull that off


[23-Dec-21 04:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
free AML for everyone


[23-Dec-21 04:11 PM] domicius#0000

[24-Dec-21 10:59 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone I have just sent the following message to all members of POL corp:
```I am DLR of Antares Holdings Corp, founder and leader of OOG corporation. I noticed that you have recently incorporated into POL with 2 other members.

I am contacting the three of you to propose a merger/buyout between our two corporations. During this proposed buyout, POL would disband and join OOG. I think that there is unique opportunity here considering that all of our respective members are in Antares space, on the same planets in many cases. 

As for the terms of the merger, I think you will find them quite favorable. There are 3 requirements:

1. POL members would leave POL and join OOG.

2. DLR would remain as the leader of OOG.

3. At least one member of POL (preferably all) would join the OOG discord server for communications purposes.

Beyond these, there are no hard requirements from OOG. You would be equals among our shareholders, and would not lose any autonomy in game. Immediately following the merger, I would personally transfer a sum of 2500 AIC (tax free) to each member of POL via local market contracts. This would effectively be the buyout of your shares for 1.50 AIC per share, and provide 'free' entry to OOG with 1000 shares at 1.00 AIC each.

We do not make any requirements of our members to donate, build certain things, or operate in any specific way. We are a very cooperative group, and consistently provide good prices, supply chain guarantees, and favorable/free shipping arrangements within the corporation.

Additionally, I have had reports from current OOG members that you are cooperative players with fair business practices and demonstrated generosity in game. Yorkshire Water specifically has been described as "Super cool". This is exactly the kind of good-faith cooperation that we encourage in OOG, and we would be happy to welcome you to the team.

Please, do discuss and come back to me with questions, concerns, or conditions.```

WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, MY FIRENDS!


[26-Dec-21 09:48 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@everyone as you are likely aware, we have brought on some experienced multi-base players.

This is an excellent time for us to push new bases for members who only have one base.


[26-Dec-21 09:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
If you are currently on one base, it is time to prioritize the second base üôÇ


[26-Dec-21 09:49 AM] dasefx1#0000
I am happy to help üôÇ


[26-Dec-21 09:49 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Myself as well.


[26-Dec-21 09:54 AM] spatial_piano#0000
I have 16 PSL on Phobos (in 30 min), 8 on ANT warehouse, so that's enough for 2 bases even without taking stuff off market.


[26-Dec-21 09:55 AM] insensless72#0000
I have a good stock of bfabs and lfabs


[26-Dec-21 10:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I just sent enough LFABs for a core module to ANT, but they are not sold yet


[26-Dec-21 10:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can keep the core module fabs in inventory. So with this we have enough for 2 bases in current inventory between me, mark and insensless


[26-Dec-21 12:51 PM] colerror#0000
I'll probably take one, I'll be back around on Tuesday


[26-Dec-21 01:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Great!


[26-Dec-21 03:46 PM] domicius#0000
Have you guys seen Barbarian Econ? Quite often holds a buy and a sell position on the market on order to make money without actually producing anything. Basically takes advantage of of the illiquidity of the market.

[26-Dec-21 03:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes, I have noticed this.


[26-Dec-21 03:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There is huge (immeasurable?) opportunity cost in this strategy, but it is obvious how one would make money doing this.


[26-Dec-21 03:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I prefer to put all capital/resources into scaling up my bases and expanding, instead of keeping 200k+ tied up on the exchange


[26-Dec-21 03:49 PM] domicius#0000
Indeed. Its more that he's basically set himself up as a MM, replacing the existing MM.


[26-Dec-21 03:51 PM] domicius#0000
Since there is no cost to this strategy, he will eventually control all commodities... Just rinsing them through his accounts. The key is he isn't rushed, so can hold positions forever.


[26-Dec-21 03:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea, he could get overwhelmed by the market, but at that point he would have made a ton of money


[26-Dec-21 03:51 PM] domicius#0000
Yes. And he's just relist his buy and sell


[26-Dec-21 03:54 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There is cost to this strategy. He does not create wealth, or at least not as much as he could be if he was investing in base building


[26-Dec-21 03:55 PM] domicius#0000
Agreed!


[26-Dec-21 03:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
He is playing a zero sums game, and with the exponential growth that other players are having, I expect he will get passed in terms of net assets and income


[26-Dec-21 03:56 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Maybe he is a finance day-trade wizard and still comes out ahead of us all. Hard to say.


[26-Dec-21 03:58 PM] domicius#0000
He saves hours on not having to do spreadsheets! More likely, I think he's got a low maintenance game amd just logs in once a week in order to do something. Oh well, just thought I'd call it out.

what is the ASE price? Earthling is trying to build an ORC too and we are looking for price reference points.


[07-Jan-22 04:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Currently Earthling prioritizes the IY-206i base which is being built tomorrow, but ORC is next on the list.


[07-Jan-22 04:40 PM] figaro0714#0000

@everyone molp is not responding concerning the HQ bonus on Nike.


[08-Jan-22 12:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I am willing to be optimistic here and agree with @dasefx1 that being allowed to build the project almost certainly means the +10% bonus will be applied on planet as described in the project screen.


[08-Jan-22 12:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So, if the main RFAB holders/donators can agree to take the risk here in this "grey area" I think we should move forward with the project.

@dasefx1

[08-Jan-22 12:15 PM] insensless72#0000
I think getting it started sounds great


[08-Jan-22 12:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the RFABs cannot be recovered once donated


[08-Jan-22 12:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I vote to donate though. The suspense is killing me.

So apparently there is a shipyard on A1C


[10-Jan-22 05:09 PM] domicius#0000
So ship building near Phobos is a thing!


[10-Jan-22 05:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yes, it was always there. Only ‚Äúnaturally occuring‚Äù shipyard in the game


[10-Jan-22 05:10 PM] domicius#0000
Ah!


[10-Jan-22 05:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Other planets would need to build a shipyard as a planetary infrastructure project

[10-Jan-22 05:10 PM] domicius#0000
That's what I thought we needed to do too


[10-Jan-22 05:12 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with this one on A1C some players have already made glass furnace tech ships, no faster than light capability at all.


[10-Jan-22 05:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
these ships are forever stuck in Antares 1, but there is some utility in there such as Phobos <‚Äî> ANT trips


[10-Jan-22 05:14 PM] domicius#0000
Yeah, makes sense if you prefer not going to the CX with long jumps


[10-Jan-22 05:14 PM] domicius#0000
All added capacity is good capacity


[10-Jan-22 05:15 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Are the shipyards in the other CX systems built? I thought all the systems started with one?


[10-Jan-22 05:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
VH-331E has one, also Pallada and Yannick (OT-580d, UV-351b)


[10-Jan-22 05:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Hmm, I remember very early on it was explained to me that A1C had the only shipyard.


[10-Jan-22 05:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It could be that these others were built, or simply added by the devs during a patch


[10-Jan-22 05:27 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah. I found the other 3 when I played around with the planet data I downloaded from FIO.


[11-Jan-22 04:40 AM] domicius#0000
So on KI-840c, i haven't got a full complement of Settlers despite the fact that there seem to be unemployed settlers about. I only have 41 out of 50 and this is bringing me (or rather my efficiency) down. Any ideas on how to resolve this?


[11-Jan-22 07:19 AM] dasefx1#0000
only solution is to wait till next report üôÇ


[11-Jan-22 09:23 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yep. One way to look at the situation is ‚Äúif the planet cannot fully supply my workforce, then I am getting as much as any player can get from the planet and contributing to its workforce growth in the process‚Äù


[12-Jan-22 05:03 PM] figaro0714#0000
Selling 8 ASE, and 4 ATA


[12-Jan-22 09:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@figaro0714 can you hold on to those until this Friday?


[12-Jan-22 09:27 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Earthling will buy them all, but needs to sell off some inventory first. It will take about 1 day.


[12-Jan-22 11:52 PM] figaro0714#0000
@bitcoin_ape sure can


[14-Jan-22 12:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

let me know if there's a good way to cooperate, I'm mainly producing bfabs, PE, MCG


[15-Jan-22 01:06 PM] insensless72#0000
How much PE and BDE do you have currently?


[15-Jan-22 01:08 PM] kharadan#0000
almost nothing right now, but I make 4k PE a day, so on that front I can provide quite a lot in few days


[15-Jan-22 01:09 PM] kharadan#0000
with bfabs I'm currently making what I need to settle Harmonie, so again, not much I can offer, but give it few days and I can share some

!join Antares
!join Phobos


[16-Jan-22 12:07 AM] colerror#0000
Yep, I'm in


[16-Jan-22 02:17 AM] domicius#0000
I guess its time to think about building a base on Nike!


[16-Jan-22 02:17 AM] domicius#0000
Question - do rigs ALWAYS extract water? Even, say, on Phobos?


[16-Jan-22 02:53 AM] domicius#0000
Also, heads up - Madnewmy is leaving the game and is selling up on a lot of planets. Good time to buy construction materials?

[16-Jan-22 08:35 AM] insensless72#0000
Rigs, EXT, COL will only collect materials available on the planet theyre built on


[16-Jan-22 08:36 AM] insensless72#0000
So yes, a rig  would pull water on Phobos


[16-Jan-22 09:11 AM] domicius#0000
Just FYI, I'm going to take a massive hit rep. Listed a bunch of items for Yarro to transfer, but put it under "sell" for 1 AIC instead of buy.... And someone picked them up. Im not gonna fulfill, obvs, so my rep will tank. Hopefully it'll pick up at some point...


[16-Jan-22 09:14 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Let's hope it's not a huge hit. I'm not sure how exactly rep is calculated, but I had one breach and it didn't affect my rep at all. I think it depends on the amount breached and amount successfully provided in other contracts


[16-Jan-22 09:14 AM] spatial_piano#0000
My breach was like 4k worth.


[16-Jan-22 09:28 AM] domicius#0000
It was 5 contracts, worth 10s of thousands of AIC in materials. Hopefully doing lots of trades in corp might help.


[16-Jan-22 09:29 AM] domicius#0000
Mind you, the buyer only paid 5 AIC ü§£


[16-Jan-22 09:30 AM] spatial_piano#0000
Yeah, it might be that you are dinged only for 5 AIC worth. But there is also the possibility that you are dinged once per cotract which could be bad


[16-Jan-22 09:30 AM] domicius#0000
Oh well. Nothing I can do about it.

Project Protostar Report #???
Hello everybody!  Delivererofdeath (MRF) here!  This week‚Äôs entry for the progress on Project Protostar is going to be a slight deviation from the norm here, as Xenogenic has unfortunately quit the game before the contest officially ended.  We haven‚Äôt had an update for 4 weeks, so even though...

anyone got any idea how stability is calculated? My profit went down compared to the past 2 periods and somehow my stability rating went up


[25-Jan-22 01:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think it is based partly on revenue growth and cash reserves


[25-Jan-22 01:17 PM] namthorn#0000
hmm, gross revenue growth would make sense


[25-Jan-22 01:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Frequently dipping to near zero cash, and producing or trading in ways that dont trigger ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù events in game finances will work against your stability rating


[25-Jan-22 01:18 PM] namthorn#0000
i always stick near zero cash xD


[25-Jan-22 01:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
despite it being a very stable play style üôÇ


[25-Jan-22 01:18 PM] namthorn#0000
sub 2k most of the time


[25-Jan-22 01:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Yea same here, and vertical production which messes up my revenue


[25-Jan-22 01:19 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i was on C stability for like 7 months


[25-Jan-22 01:19 PM] namthorn#0000
hmm, could be that i'm more horizontally built i guess


[25-Jan-22 01:19 PM] namthorn#0000
only verticality are extractors


[25-Jan-22 01:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you consume or build with the majority of your product, you miss on revenue


[25-Jan-22 01:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
even though you are probably getting more value by using the items, it is not measurable


[25-Jan-22 01:21 PM] namthorn#0000
makes sense, hopefully they'll do something to approximate value of produced goods like product average at time of creation to make the FIN buffers more readable


[25-Jan-22 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea this is a common complaint/suggestion


[25-Jan-22 01:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I also am a proponent of your solution but the game devs have their priorities


[25-Jan-22 01:23 PM] namthorn#0000
ye true. It's a minor thing I can keep track of outside the game not a major prio

[26-Jan-22 05:28 AM] domicius#0000
What's a hub?


[26-Jan-22 05:30 AM] dasefx1#0000
Like medium storage in and out. So deliver all there first from all planets and than send to right planet


[26-Jan-22 05:31 AM] dasefx1#0000
Ant is closes to deliver on ant 1 so also sf saving


[26-Jan-22 05:31 AM] domicius#0000
I suppose. It depends on whether you're shipping to sell (from other systems) or shipping to feed the supply chain


[26-Jan-22 05:32 AM] dasefx1#0000
Both, easier to redistribute consumables for sure.


[26-Jan-22 05:33 AM] dasefx1#0000

Hey guys, any thoughts on this - I'm looking to expand with one of the following buildings (I'm in manufacturing/construction). Is there one that might help the corp's needs or that I should target as a new player? Weaving Plant (WPL), Glass Furnace (GF), Smelter (SME), Refinery (REF), or another Basic Materials Plant (BMP)


[28-Jan-22 05:16 PM] insensless72#0000
Where are you setup currently?


[28-Jan-22 05:31 PM] yjhasaday#0000
In Phobos


[28-Jan-22 05:31 PM] yjhasaday#0000
But I'm thinking of starting a base on Nike to take advantage of the Corps HQ buff


[28-Jan-22 05:35 PM] namthorn#0000
If you're going Nike then fab production is probably a good idea, there's good intracorp LST deals. If you're thinking phobos then WPL for NL to get the Lfab price down wouldn't go amiss imo


[28-Jan-22 05:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn note that phobos is now electronics specialized. the manufacturing boost has moved to antares 1 c


[28-Jan-22 05:36 PM] namthorn#0000
Ah true


[28-Jan-22 05:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
still valid to do manufacturing on phobos, but not quite so attractive these days


[28-Jan-22 05:37 PM] namthorn#0000
Well if they have the manufacturing experts anyway then there's still something to be gained


[28-Jan-22 05:37 PM] namthorn#0000
But I agree, that CoGC change really threw a spanner in the works


[28-Jan-22 05:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
lt was the best long term move, but certainly causing some short term disruption


[28-Jan-22 05:38 PM] namthorn#0000
Especially for new folks that can't dream of getting electronics production up


[28-Jan-22 05:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea, agreed, i can see that being painful for a new player who just doubled down on manufacturing there


[28-Jan-22 05:39 PM] namthorn#0000
Ah now I remember, thats why I didn't settle phobos


[28-Jan-22 05:39 PM] namthorn#0000
Because there was news along that lone


[28-Jan-22 05:39 PM] namthorn#0000
Line*


[28-Jan-22 05:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but the high tech industry does fuel low tech economy, and phobos is the only real choice for local high tech production


[28-Jan-22 05:40 PM] namthorn#0000
Still waiting for the SI/FS demand to pick up lol


[28-Jan-22 05:40 PM] namthorn#0000
Doesn't appear to have done much for the wider economy as of yet imo


[28-Jan-22 05:42 PM] namthorn#0000
I appreciate they are taxing electronics more and lowered manufacturing taxes, but it really doesn't help the bottom line for a lot of folk as of yet I think.


[28-Jan-22 05:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Give it time!


[28-Jan-22 05:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have seen SI orders moving on the LM, but not exactly high volumes


[28-Jan-22 05:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think once the electronics bases are more fully built out on Phobos, the effects will become more visible

[28-Jan-22 05:44 PM] dasefx1#0000
Most things here go internal


[28-Jan-22 05:44 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yeah, I want to chill on Phobos for a bit still. I don't want to go too crazy with bfabs because I want to explore different industries with this universe. As far as I understand they will do another reset on full game release? Which means it would be cool to understand other industries when I start up next universe!


[28-Jan-22 05:46 PM] dasefx1#0000
In my opinion on beginning best is always construction, biggest players start from own fabs.in the middle game chemical as well plus own consumables like dw and rat as this price never stable on cx

[28-Jan-22 05:46 PM] namthorn#0000
Full game release is a while off


[28-Jan-22 05:46 PM] dasefx1#0000
On the end best is electronics as cx market makers like LOG, drones


[28-Jan-22 05:47 PM] namthorn#0000
New universe would be an interesting proposition. I do wonder how people got going early in ANT


[28-Jan-22 05:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
myself, earthling and insensless bootstrapped everything @namthorn


[28-Jan-22 05:48 PM] namthorn#0000
Nice


[28-Jan-22 05:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we all started about 1-2 months in on this game


[28-Jan-22 05:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but we were noobs ü§£


[28-Jan-22 05:48 PM] namthorn#0000
Seems like its really tough going without easy access to LST/H


[28-Jan-22 05:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
LST was covered very early by Lockreed


[28-Jan-22 05:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
hydrogen was‚Ä¶ bad.


[28-Jan-22 05:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Eventually we got access on KI-401d which is when i started going all in on polymer plants


[28-Jan-22 05:50 PM] namthorn#0000
Oh ye, Ki 401d is a H printer, but it requires AEF and INS iirc


[28-Jan-22 05:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes, Bob industries took the plunge there


[28-Jan-22 05:50 PM] namthorn#0000
Which is super yikes


[28-Jan-22 05:51 PM] namthorn#0000
Ye did a ton of shipping for him


[28-Jan-22 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
AEF was manageable, but the argon situation was horrendous


[28-Jan-22 05:51 PM] namthorn#0000
Got me going


[28-Jan-22 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
use planet search to find the only planet with argon and no low temperature conditions. its hilarious.


[28-Jan-22 05:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
all other argon planets require ins, so it is a chicken vs egg problem


[28-Jan-22 05:54 PM] namthorn#0000
Ikr! Did some hypotheticals the other day figuring out what I would do in an early universe and the problems were numerous in ANT


[28-Jan-22 05:54 PM] namthorn#0000
MOR was super easy in comparison


[28-Jan-22 05:55 PM] namthorn#0000
No wonder its the most populous region


[28-Jan-22 05:55 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yea, easy mode starter planets.


[28-Jan-22 05:55 PM] namthorn#0000
It's like, ok i guess this is the sacrifice for a t1 AL planet?


[28-Jan-22 05:58 PM] namthorn#0000
Made me realise MMs are necessary if we want region diversity


[28-Jan-22 05:58 PM] namthorn#0000
Else every region needs a source of all basic resources


[28-Jan-22 05:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It was playable, and collectively we took full advantage of our Phobos/Deimos/Nike/Harmonia network


[28-Jan-22 05:59 PM] insensless72#0000
@yjhasaday If youre interested in expanding into different industries the Electronics specialization wouldnt be a bad idea and currently not really being produced in corp. With that being said there is demand for the product from any of the buildings you listed early


[28-Jan-22 06:00 PM] namthorn#0000
There's a shortage of EXO rn if that qt all influences you


[28-Jan-22 06:01 PM] namthorn#0000
GFs are prob better on Deimos because the production times are ungodly slow


[28-Jan-22 06:01 PM] namthorn#0000
And SIO is cheap a f


[28-Jan-22 06:03 PM] namthorn#0000
4 experts and CoGC and all lux is about 10.4h production times for GL


[28-Jan-22 06:05 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Thank you! I will work towards Electronics because it seems like a cool late game goal. Perhaps the alternative late game goal would be to build ship parts/engines/etc?


[28-Jan-22 06:06 PM] namthorn#0000
Ship parts are the late game yea


[28-Jan-22 06:08 PM] namthorn#0000
If you want to go for electronics give us a shout, myself and others would prob be willing to divert production towards SI or other electronics related inputs given the demand.


[28-Jan-22 06:08 PM] namthorn#0000
The CX demand just isn't there atm is the problem


[28-Jan-22 06:37 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday the easiest route into electronics should be cleanroom. @dasefx1 is pretty knowledgeable here and is also our most advanced electronics player. You two should coordinate!


[28-Jan-22 06:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Namthorn and Yaro are right though, it is difficult to get into electronics as a new player and the markets are behind the scenes/corporate internal


[28-Jan-22 06:39 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also, electronics and shipbuilding are not mutually exclusive. FTL ships require advanced electronics which often require lower tier electronics themselves


[28-Jan-22 06:50 PM] namthorn#0000
yea that's my main concern, no easy buyer if there's no orders lined up.


[28-Jan-22 06:51 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Maybe it will be there once more people get to late game, I see all the talk of the planetary stuff and it looks like there's electronics involved in sustaining some of the buildings. So there might be some ongoing demand as planets get more buildings. Either way I'm a longgggggg way off from electronics so I'll let you know if I get there!


[28-Jan-22 06:51 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ah, yes the micro headphones on Phobos


[28-Jan-22 06:51 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, if you can find the buyers through chats it's likely a lucrative industry


[28-Jan-22 06:52 PM] namthorn#0000
but that requires engaging the governors/buyers directly


[28-Jan-22 06:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we need these to fund the library and university and this is needed for high tech workforce (scientists)


[28-Jan-22 06:52 PM] namthorn#0000
we do have a governor laying around internally though...


[28-Jan-22 06:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can get anyone connected to an Antares area buyer. I have developed some amount of influence in this area üòÑ


[28-Jan-22 06:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that doesnt mean I can guarantee a deal though. I can figure out which wealthy player is doing what.


[28-Jan-22 11:10 PM] colerror#0000

Anyone need anything shipped from ANT CX? I have a ship here that is leaving in the next hour but is less than half full. I'm also planning a trip out to Nike/Deimos after it stops at Phobos to drop off its load. So I can take things from CX out to Nike/Deimos if you need something!


[29-Jan-22 12:02 PM] kharadan#0000
I just posted an ad ANT > Deimos


[29-Jan-22 12:07 PM] yjhasaday#0000
accepted! Still less than half full, I'll wait another 30 min to see if anyone else wants anything moved


[29-Jan-22 12:14 PM] artokun#0000
Oh yes plz


[29-Jan-22 12:15 PM] artokun#0000
I have a small shipment


[29-Jan-22 12:15 PM] artokun#0000
I'll post something for Ant > Deimos


[29-Jan-22 12:16 PM] insensless72#0000
@yjhasaday Do you have room for 120t?

[29-Jan-22 12:16 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yes


[29-Jan-22 12:16 PM] yjhasaday#0000
about 260t and 300 m3


[29-Jan-22 12:18 PM] insensless72#0000

I always have GL to trade, what are you using it for out of curiosity?

@namthorn when you have around 200 for sale, let me know and I will take all üôÇ


[02-Feb-22 04:26 AM] namthorn#0000
sure


[02-Feb-22 05:39 AM] kharadan#0000
I'm thinking to make a C run to Hortus.   The only obstacle is my lack of ICA. Does anyone have ICA they would exchange for AIC?
Looking for about 50k


[02-Feb-22 07:36 AM] dasefx1#0000
very hard to buy ICA, I tried few times without results, and in my opinion C is too heavy to go to hortus. RAT, DW, COF, CAF, maybe worth it, but for sure not C


[02-Feb-22 07:39 AM] kharadan#0000
The savings are not that big, agree you're probably right


[02-Feb-22 07:43 AM] dasefx1#0000
I had once crazy idea, that I bought 1000 ICA, and rented warehouse on hortus, and listed 5 x 100 CAF to buy in AIC, after some time one contract took, I paid, and next day my partner make coliq ( he had 250 days long account, and good ratings) . So I end doing business on Hortus üòÑ


[02-Feb-22 07:45 AM] kharadan#0000
Ah, yes, you mentioned that one before :)
I did some good business there, but at the moment I don't have anything to ship there and sell for ICA. Almost all I produce I use, or I already have a buyer


[02-Feb-22 07:45 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think better to do business locally üòâ


[02-Feb-22 08:52 AM] domicius#0000
Hi, if anyone wants water from Benten (currently around the 48 CIS to 50 CIS mark) then send me some CIS and I'll ship to ANT1 for you. Shipping out tomorrow lots of room to ship, but don't have enough currency to prebuy much


[02-Feb-22 07:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@domicius I know we talked about this, but then I went and got myself into this situation.

wish I could take you up on the H2O offer


[03-Feb-22 12:10 AM] domicius#0000
I can swap for LST - also I meant DW just to be clear. Also also I've got another ship in Benten making another run (because actually EVERYTHING is cheaper on Benten) so it's not too late! 1


[03-Feb-22 12:16 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
happy to swap LST, i regularly bring it to Phobos


[03-Feb-22 12:25 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and yes, I need H2O or DW for the same reasons. Let me know how much LST and when on Phobos, ill make sure it gets delivered


[03-Feb-22 11:13 AM] domicius#0000
Ill swap  183 LST for 200 DW on Phobos or 140 DW on Nike at current rates. Its all becoming veeu expensive!


[03-Feb-22 11:15 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sounds good to me. I need DW in both places, Plan whatever delivery works for you and then ill transfer the LST at that location. Im happy to work with increments of 183 LST


[03-Feb-22 11:44 AM] domicius#0000
Ok, 200DW on Phobos in a day.


[03-Feb-22 01:53 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will need ~2 days for a round trip to Nike, but the flights are already in motion.


[04-Feb-22 08:02 AM] domicius#0000
Great. I have a second 200DW load for you already on the way, so you can just keep it coming. Im running H from AI1 to CI1, and items back

BTA is not on the sheet, what is your price?


[06-Feb-22 09:02 AM] dasefx1#0000
if I remember in corp we exchange for 500 p/u


[06-Feb-22 09:08 AM] insensless72#0000
@everyone I spent some time last night messing with our discord settings. I created "roles" for each planet and assigned each player to each role based on which planets you are located on (to the best of my knowledge.) This will allow us to @here or @Nike for example and only the players on that planet or assigned to that "role" will get the message. Ideally this will keep every person from getting a message when two people are talking about local trades. It works by posting in a planet chat with the @ insert planet name. It should not affect the ability to see or post in any channel. If that is not the case, let me know so I can change it immediately

Hi all, I have a business partner on Phobos who has inquired about our corp. He's interested in joining if we're recruiting so I told him I would ask. He's a farmer that supplies me my RAT and DW on Phobos, he's informed me he has 8 Rigs, 5 FRM, and 3 FP on Phobos. His in-game name is Cazertanu, company is CAZ-Dynamics (CAZD). Let me know! (I understand he'll need to join Discord for a while before sending an in-game invite)

Looks like our corp got pretty much all of them! I threw mine back on the market for profits, but I do have some OVE on Phobos if anyone needs

Hi everyone, @dasefx1  has been kind enough to provide me with a loan to start the carbon base on Deimos. I've committed to starting it up in 8 days and will be working on Bfabs to bring along with me. I'll need your help with the CM though so I'm hoping to get prices from you of things that I can buy off you from the below shopping list:


[09-Feb-22 02:46 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm willing to head to Nike, Deimos or Phobos to pick up
BBH
LSE
LDE
LTA
TRU
PSL

[09-Feb-22 02:48 PM] yjhasaday#0000

[09-Feb-22 02:50 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Phobos. PSLs are at current price 1200.


[09-Feb-22 02:50 PM] spatial_piano#0000
PSL price is actually very low currently


[09-Feb-22 03:02 PM] yjhasaday#0000

@everyoneit seems I have caused some confusion with my LFAB prices. My supply is limited, and in the past these prices were to stimulate OOG base building at my own expense.


[17-Feb-22 07:29 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think 2000 per LSE is not sustainable, and likely loses money for many producers.

but I was happy to sell at that price, and now we will all benefit (directly and indirectly) from the new OOG bases that were built.


[17-Feb-22 07:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we will continue with the fixed BFAB prices, but I dont want to cause a mess with too much price fixing, especially on more expensive items.

Good plan @domicius . I will do the same.


[18-Feb-22 04:45 AM] dasefx1#0000
I think we can set up together all corp fabs pricing to be same all time ?


[18-Feb-22 07:41 AM] cazertanu#0000
Yaro, you bring up an intriguing goal. I think an important step towards that is finding a way to show all of our imports and exports organized by planet and by player. I imagine this will need spreadsheets and flowcharts.


[18-Feb-22 07:43 AM] cazertanu#0000

[18-Feb-22 02:52 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Nike is the highest ranked planet, and most of us are on nike, so we mostly have white names due to that.


[18-Feb-22 03:02 PM] insensless72#0000
The roles are set up as planets. Each planet had a different color, but since Nike has our HQ I assigned everyone to Nike as well. Since Nike was the highest ranked role behind moderators Everyones name appeared white

and 1500+ SF

selling that and buying C in ANT would give more C I think


[07-Mar-22 12:20 PM] kharadan#0000
Thanks for a tip. S I can sell you locally on Deimos. The rest I can get you from BEN if you like


[07-Mar-22 12:21 PM] allocater#0000
ah I don't need I just saw the margins are 20%+ for that on ANT


[07-Mar-22 12:21 PM] allocater#0000
someone is buying S for 300 üòÖ


[07-Mar-22 12:22 PM] kharadan#0000
I see. Ok, I'll look into it and see what makes most sense, thanks


[11-Mar-22 03:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
SF price is spiking hard. Have some refiners quit, or something? The demand is high today, but  overall there doesn't seem to be an increase in demand.


[11-Mar-22 03:24 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Or are people shifting to FF?


[11-Mar-22 03:25 PM] allocater#0000
Moria hit the MM yesterday too


[11-Mar-22 03:53 PM] namthorn#0000
I think it's just a blip, there's been like 20k traded in the past few days.


[11-Mar-22 05:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[11-Mar-22 05:51 PM] namthorn#0000
Something like that, if stock isn't refilled in the next week we might have a problem. But for now its fine imo.

Hello! Welcome to OOG, we are a pretty diverse corporation with players on many planets. You will notice channels to the left in which players are located on and you can communicate through


[12-Mar-22 01:25 PM] insensless72#0000
You are primarily Phobos with ties to Deimos and Harmonia correct?


[12-Mar-22 01:26 PM] yang_mills#0000
My largest base is on Phobos, and I have a small base on Deimos extracting resources. I plan to open next week my 3rd base on Harmonia. I am in a rush to do it before the Steam release on April.


[12-Mar-22 01:27 PM] yang_mills#0000
Because after the release on Steam Harmonia might become full with new players.

I realized I'm just going through the motions with this game for some time. It'd been fun, but at some point it became just upkeep, so I decided to stop playing.
I'll post my inventory on planet chats. You can post ads to purchase whatever you see there for free. Consumables may still slowly diminish, feel free to ping me for exact numbers. Once this is resolved, I'll leave the corp not to dilute dividends you are getting.

Thanks for having a good time and wish you good profits

actualy a slight delay here as I am afraid to post incorrect information. Waiting on explicit confirmation about what inventory we have


[30-Mar-22 03:30 PM] yang_mills#0000
How does the ship construction work? The player has to create a blueprint, gather all the components on a planet with a shipyard, then put his production order into the queue? How much time does the assembly take? Does one have to pay for the assembly? Is it possible to trade ships, and how?


[30-Mar-22 03:30 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
anyone can make a blueprint, they are free


[30-Mar-22 03:31 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you must bring the requires items from a valid blueprint to the shipyard to assemble it, yes. Times are given on the shipyard buffer on that planet


[30-Mar-22 03:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i think there are taxes for assembly? not much though. maybe @dasefx1 knows


[30-Mar-22 03:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
ships are non transferrable and non-reversible once built.


[30-Mar-22 03:32 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
whoever builds it at the shipyard owns it permanently


[30-Mar-22 03:33 PM] yang_mills#0000
But I've seen ship auction anoucements.


[30-Mar-22 03:33 PM] namthorn#0000
ye they sell the parts


[30-Mar-22 03:33 PM] namthorn#0000
a complete set


[30-Mar-22 03:33 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the method is to sell each item of a pre-determined blueprint to the buyer, who then builds it and flies away


[30-Mar-22 03:34 PM] dasefx1#0000
No taxes, only waiting to build


[30-Mar-22 03:34 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok. I think the devs should introduce the option to sell ships. It should be through special contracts on the local market.


[30-Mar-22 03:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
we just use normal contracts üôÇ the ship components are items just like everyrhing else in game


[30-Mar-22 03:37 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, but then one can realise that he has too many ships and may want to get rid of one of them. Also the ships may be sold on planets without shipyard. So it would be a kind of business: one produces ships and delivers them to the customers at their doorstep.


[30-Mar-22 03:40 PM] insensless72#0000
I imagine the ability to sell completed ships has to be in the future goals of the devs, its basically the end game goal


[30-Mar-22 03:41 PM] insensless72#0000
Though not being able to sell ships kind of puts a limit on one player being a powerhouse and pumping out 100 of them


[30-Mar-22 03:42 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also there should be the possibility for corporation owned shipyards. It would be a corporation project like the headquarters. It would take one planetary plot. Then there would be two types of fees: fees for corp members, and also fees for outsiders if they are granted access to the corp shipyard. Fees would be fixed by the corp.

[30-Mar-22 03:44 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
currently what you just described conflicts with the way taxes(fees) are collected. A corporation controls the planet via the governorship, and 100% of planet fees are distributed to that corporations shares


[30-Mar-22 03:45 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
last universe, they had to reset the entire game to allow for shipbuilding, because the old game was hard-coded to allow only 2 ships per player, with no mechanism to expand. So they re made the game as the version which we are playing now


[30-Mar-22 03:46 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
i am excited for major changes next universe, hopefully they have made enough money to do a round 3


[30-Mar-22 03:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
corporations and taxes in general could use some attention, but we have made the most of the current structure i think


[30-Mar-22 03:47 PM] allocater#0000
I'd love terraforming, ie. for 1mil you can increase fertility by 0.01% or change atmosphere, temperature by 0.01%


[30-Mar-22 03:49 PM] insensless72#0000
Terraforming would be awesome. There does need to be something to strive to spend your money on late game. Whats the point in having 2mil if youre only buying consumables


[30-Mar-22 03:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
buy OOG brand space ships


[30-Mar-22 03:49 PM] insensless72#0000
All this being said, the game released last year (I think) so its still early development


[30-Mar-22 05:03 PM] yang_mills#0000
There could be limits like the max amount of ships one can own depends on the level of HQ, like for the bases. Also introduce a rule that the two starting ships cannot be sold. This is to prevent  new players being lured into selling their ships.

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[30-Mar-22 05:03 PM] yang_mills#0000
The two starting ships would be permanently attached to the company.


[30-Mar-22 05:13 PM] yang_mills#0000
Since there would be limits on how many ships a company can own, one would be incentivised to get better quality ships and get rid of lower quality ships to free slots. To get rid of a ship, one could either "recycle" it in any shipyard and get a percentage of the components back, or sell the ship through special contract on the local market. This mechanic would create a secondary market for ships.


[30-Mar-22 06:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is a great idea


[30-Mar-22 06:05 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also I would feel inspired to become a used car salesman in game.

Ship trading and more
Hello. Here are some suggestions regarding the ship building.  1)Introduce the possibility of ship upgrades. This has been already suggested. It would be a kind of shipyard job. One would be able to replace some components by some other version and the material cost would be the full cost of the new component. One would also get back a pecentage...

Hey all, quick help question - I thought when I upgraded my HQ it would allow me more production queue slots? Is that not the case? I could really use some more now that I have my BMPs trying to make like 7+ different things


[12-Apr-22 11:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
no, it doesnt do that


[12-Apr-22 11:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it adds permits, so you can have more bases, or expand existing bases with more building area


[12-Apr-22 11:16 AM] dasefx1#0000
it is ad slots, but with exact HQ upgrades, now I had 17 of them


[12-Apr-22 11:16 AM] dasefx1#0000
I am not sure which one, but HQ upgrade  add them


[12-Apr-22 11:26 AM] namthorn#0000

Does anyone in corp extract H? Now that yaro is out of the H game I need a new supplier - thought I would check with you all before I start buying large amounts of CX


[15-Apr-22 08:33 AM] yang_mills#0000
Contact DiggingLake or Slomes. They might sell you a full shipment on the LM on KI-401d.


[15-Apr-22 08:36 AM] yjhasaday#0000
That's not a bad idea, thanks! Or maybe I'll post on UFO Antares to see if someone can supply a little closer. But first I'll give it some time to see if anyone in corp responds


[15-Apr-22 10:33 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@yjhasaday either this, or markymark in corp


[15-Apr-22 10:33 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but slomes and digginglake are been the main suppliers for the region


[16-Apr-22 02:34 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
At last, it is time for me to retire my original buildings on Phobos. I have expanded the base to 750 area, and now need room for another AML.

Yes, this is a changed introduced in the last update.

Only for the first base though.


[20-Apr-22 10:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
One can establish the first base anywhere with the ghost slot mechanic. However, from the 2nd base on, free non-ghost plots are required.


[20-Apr-22 10:33 AM] yang_mills#0000
This is to avoid rejecting new players from the start.

So, considering you cats for my first corp... is it a good idea? I'm a small AL /BFAB producer on Deimos with a bad idea base on a local iceball producing fuel.


[21-Apr-22 10:39 AM] yang_mills#0000
Hello Emperyan!

Well, we are the best corp in game üòé


[21-Apr-22 10:40 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
It is impossible to go wrong with AL on Deimos. You can probably float your bad-idea-base on metallurgy profits alone, within reason.


[21-Apr-22 10:41 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
is it on ice station alpha? or a different ice ball?


[21-Apr-22 10:42 AM] emperyan11#0000
Yeah, I've already built back my bank account and filled my fuel bunkers. Starting to sell to the CX now too!

Not in game, but in general we are looking for engagement, collaboration, communication and long-term plans


[21-Apr-22 11:05 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We tend to invest in our newer/smaller members to help them scale up quickly, but the nature of this game is that many people stop playing after a few weeks


[21-Apr-22 11:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
So, we need to be careful that a person will stick with us, instead of take some investment and then go inactive or stop communicating.


[21-Apr-22 11:08 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Oh. The only hard requirement in game is having bases in Antares. All of our members are local and this is a key element to our operations and strategy

Welcome Emperyan! Will you tell me your locations and business name in game so I can set up your tags? Basically what we like it do is give new members a 7 day trial period. We find this works best for both parties. As the player you can feel out OOG as a corp and the corp can feel you out as a player. After 7 days, if you want to stick around and be part of the fun we will send you a formal in game invite to corp, which is when you will receive dividend payouts from our governed planets.


[21-Apr-22 02:40 PM] namthorn#0000

[21-Apr-22 03:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
Also use AL for EXO (not much) and for SI.


[21-Apr-22 03:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
Lfabs consume much more AL than Bfabs.


[21-Apr-22 03:06 PM] namthorn#0000
that they do, though thankfully i havent needed to make a ton in a while, just bfab spamming. though that will change for hq level 6 iirc


[21-Apr-22 03:08 PM] yang_mills#0000
But yeah, HWP hungry!


[21-Apr-22 03:09 PM] namthorn#0000
in summary, moar AL required


[21-Apr-22 03:10 PM] yang_mills#0000

We also sell LST in corp dirt cheap, usually around 35ea. Another route you could take would be C production. It is also almost always in high demand and in demand within corp

[21-Apr-22 03:32 PM] insensless72#0000
You wont go wrong either way. Just a heads up, most constructors in corp have set bfab prices, which you could utilize to rearrange or add on to bases. BSE 500, BBH 800, BDE, 800, BTA 500. Though currently we have a que for fabs so it might be a few days at least


[21-Apr-22 03:33 PM] namthorn#0000

@emperyan11 , I wanted to ask, what do you produce on ZV-759e? Do you refine SF from GAL, AMM and H that you extract locally?


[22-Apr-22 09:15 AM] yang_mills#0000
@thummper, right now there are very good prices for C on the CX (commodity exchange). This might stay like that with all these new players on Deimos who need C for metallurgy. But with one incinerator it takes time to produce a significant amount C. Maybe 5 days for 20 C, something like that.


[22-Apr-22 09:18 AM] thummper#0000
Yeah I was looking to scale up but I dont have the cash for construction parts currently, just waiting for first carbon to finish atm


[22-Apr-22 09:35 AM] yang_mills#0000
I see you bought a PRO licence.


[22-Apr-22 09:46 AM] yang_mills#0000
@thummper I can sell you some cheap basic prefabs on Phobos on the local market. But not much. Let's say for one more incinerator: 4 BSE, 3 BBH, 2 BDE and 1 BTA. Prices are 600 per BSE, 800 per BBH, 600 per BDE and 500 per BTA. Compare it to prices on the CX and see the difference. On top of that I could also sell you the 40 MCG needed for INC at 15 per unit. If you post buy ads on Phobos for these, I could fulfil them. You would need to rent a warehouse space on Phobos for that, since you don't have a base there. It costs 100 AIC per week. You can cancel it as soon as you load the mats on your ship.


[22-Apr-22 10:00 AM] thummper#0000
If it's not too much trouble for you mate that would help me greatly!


[22-Apr-22 10:03 AM] yang_mills#0000
Post the buy ads on Phobos with the indicated amounts of materials and for corresponding prices.


[22-Apr-22 10:05 AM] yang_mills#0000
@thummper When you create an ad you have to indicate the total price, not the price per unit.


[22-Apr-22 10:05 AM] thummper#0000
oh


[22-Apr-22 10:05 AM] thummper#0000
whoops


[22-Apr-22 10:05 AM] yang_mills#0000
So if you want 4 BSE, you should indicate 2400 and not 600. @thummper


[22-Apr-22 10:05 AM] yang_mills#0000
You can delete the other ads.


[22-Apr-22 10:06 AM] yang_mills#0000
Use the LMOS command. Then post new ads.


[22-Apr-22 10:11 AM] yang_mills#0000

ü§ù 

[22-Apr-22 10:12 AM] yang_mills#0000
@thummper I can also sell you on Phobos cheaper OVE, at 50 AIC per unit. Up to 20 OVE. You don't have to buy 20, you can buy less. You don't need that much OVE with a small base.


[22-Apr-22 10:16 AM] thummper#0000
ok thank you


[22-Apr-22 10:16 AM] thummper#0000
do you think it is worth putting shipping ads up because I have 1 ship idle


[22-Apr-22 10:19 AM] yang_mills#0000
Well, it's worth putting a shipping ad if it costs you less than the fuel you would use to fly from Harmonia to Phobos and back. Ask @allocater how much your shipping would cost, given the usual prices on the LM. Indicate the total weight and volume.


[22-Apr-22 10:20 AM] thummper#0000
Does the cargo type matter when making a shipping ad?


[22-Apr-22 10:20 AM] thummper#0000
thanks for the help btw


[22-Apr-22 10:20 AM] yang_mills#0000
What do you mean?


[22-Apr-22 10:21 AM] thummper#0000
like to make the ad you have to select the commodity type?


[22-Apr-22 10:23 AM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, I believe it's a separate ad for each commodity type. The shipping of small quantities from Phobos to Harmonia is usually cheap. Ask @allocater for the common prices, he knows this. But of course you would need to wait someone flying Phobos -> Harmonia to pick your ad. It's a common route, but you might wait a couple of days.


[22-Apr-22 10:24 AM] thummper#0000
ok thanks


[22-Apr-22 10:25 AM] yang_mills#0000
I think it's less than 50 AIC per 100 t or per 100 m^3, whichever weight or volume is greater.


[22-Apr-22 11:09 AM] emperyan11#0000
@yang_mills Yeah, I'm refining SF and mining FEO to feed my STL dreams on Deimos. I supplement the H from the CX since the levels are so low and I'm probably going to eventually demolish the collector as it's barely worth it. Probably going to replace it with another extractor.


[22-Apr-22 11:32 AM] allocater#0000
in system I usually burn 100+ SF, which is 1000 AIC, so 2 AIC / ton. But small amounts I shuttle for free.


[22-Apr-22 12:49 PM] yang_mills#0000
Yes, ZV-759e is one of the two FEO planets in Antares II. The other one is ZV-759b. ZV-759e offers slightly more FEO than ZV-759b, but ZV-759b should be much easier since it does not require INS on top of HSE. It's true that you can also get GAL and AMM from ZV-759e, but the quantities look tiny to me. Is your refining on ZV-759e profitable, taking into account the depreciation and the maintenance of workers?


[22-Apr-22 01:03 PM] namthorn#0000
i'd assume so or they would have gone bust. might not be the most profitable setup but building up the ANT II sector could pay out in the long term, there's a H GG too and a HAL world, so could all be serviced via a STL ship built on deimos.


[22-Apr-22 01:04 PM] yang_mills#0000
What does H GG mean?


[22-Apr-22 01:04 PM] namthorn#0000
sorry, H gas giant


[22-Apr-22 01:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
Do you mean that in this way one could stay self-sufficient for SF in the ANT II system?


[22-Apr-22 01:06 PM] namthorn#0000
you could expand and entirely keep your company within that system


[22-Apr-22 01:06 PM] yang_mills#0000
I see.


[22-Apr-22 01:07 PM] namthorn#0000
and make some savings with internal SF production yea. only thing missing is a farming world


[22-Apr-22 01:10 PM] yang_mills#0000
Well, yes, one misses a farming world in ANT II. On top of that, HSE and INS have to come from somewhere.


[22-Apr-22 01:11 PM] namthorn#0000
true, could be worthwhile still though, having a SHY in the system makes a lot of things more feasible.


[22-Apr-22 01:11 PM] yang_mills#0000
I think there is no argon for INS in ANT II.


[22-Apr-22 01:11 PM] yang_mills#0000
What is a SHY?


[22-Apr-22 01:11 PM] namthorn#0000
idk if that sthe abbreviation, shipyard


[22-Apr-22 01:11 PM] yang_mills#0000
oh


[22-Apr-22 01:13 PM] yang_mills#0000
One also misses TCO for HSE.


[22-Apr-22 01:15 PM] namthorn#0000
ye, thats where others come in to enable it, like how i can produce TCS, and anyone with a pp3 can make the ins


[22-Apr-22 01:18 PM] yang_mills#0000
I don't really believe in staying in ANT II alone. I like Mumzhar's approach (the governor of Harmonia). He basically settles every nice planet in the area and optimises his production chains, also taking into account the COGC, without  trying to be completely self-sufficient. A plot on a nice planet is the most valuable resource in this game, and there are only finitely many available.


[22-Apr-22 01:20 PM] namthorn#0000
yep, starter ones are all close to or have gone atm

Hello, thanks for the welcome


[22-Apr-22 01:26 PM] emperyan11#0000
@yang_mills So far worker upkeep is a non issue and I'm going to review the operation once repair season comes up. Thus far though I've been able to keep both ships flying, stock my fuel bunkers and still sell some SF on the CX. So... going all right?


[22-Apr-22 01:26 PM] oreville#0000
I'm a new metallurgist with a very young company -- just added my second extractor yesterday... but always getting bigger!

@oreville Your company code is ROCK, isn't it?


[22-Apr-22 01:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
Deimos is a cash machine. Or at least it was before prices on RAT went up. And RAT calmed down a bit since yesterday.


[22-Apr-22 03:07 PM] oreville#0000
It is however I'm having some trouble with the bot


[22-Apr-22 03:26 PM] yang_mills#0000
@oreville is from Deimos. The company code is ROCK.

Thank you!


[22-Apr-22 06:36 PM] yang_mills#0000
By the way, @emperyan11 , do you know a cheap source of INS? I mean cheaper than on CX. Perhaps an agreement with someone. Are Slomes (SLME) and Visinvictus (IG) the only two producers in the area?


[22-Apr-22 06:40 PM] namthorn#0000
really we'd just need some good priced AR & pp3 time. PE is produced by the bucketload in general and we have LABs in corp for the THF (which we already have a corp source for the AMM for) . The CX price isn't that bad though imo.


[22-Apr-22 06:52 PM] yang_mills#0000
This is great. Where does AR come from? I consider the possibility of a second metallurgy planet in Ant II system. A2B is cheaper, but Mumzhar and Rain produce Lfabs and Rfabs there and use a construction bonus for the COGC.


[22-Apr-22 06:58 PM] yang_mills#0000
INS hurts, but it's not that much compared to the cost of Rfabs.


[22-Apr-22 07:12 PM] emperyan11#0000
@yang_mills Yeah... don't have a source for INS. Just took my time buying. And I hear you on the RFab price... it will be a while before I expand in that direction


[22-Apr-22 07:23 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 2 PP3 on Nike that are dedicated on INS, this is pretty recent though. The first of it was used to help @spatial_piano expand on the hydrogen/ammonia planet

Is there a run down of corp member duties and benefits and such?


[23-Apr-22 04:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
We all collaborate on shipping and generally providing stable internal supply chains and favorable deals where possible.


[23-Apr-22 04:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, we try to fund the planetary infrastructure on planets where OOG governs.


[23-Apr-22 04:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
As for benefits, on Nike there is a global +10% production boost for all OOG bases. This is from the HQ.


[23-Apr-22 04:42 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Also, tax revenue from our governed planets (Nike + Phobos) is distributed weekly to OOG shareholders as a dividend.


[23-Apr-22 04:43 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
There are many other "soft" benefits which generally come from networking with other members.


[23-Apr-22 04:45 PM] neoreeves#0000
Ah cool, those are great to hear, so there is no fixed contribution of any goods/currency etc? Just donate to infrastructure if possible?

[23-Apr-22 04:47 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
This is true, we have not needed to enforce any donations so far. However we are being selective with who we extend invites to, to avoid bringing on players who arent willing to play collaboratively.


[23-Apr-22 04:47 PM] neoreeves#0000
Yes, that makes sense


[23-Apr-22 04:49 PM] neoreeves#0000
I can trade RAT on Phobos below market if it helps, my output is about 40 per day I believe


[23-Apr-22 05:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
Thats fine. We understand that it is difficult to contribute as a smaller player with limited revenue growth.

if it's only a bit you can put it up for sale 1.01 or buy at 0.99

The devs announced that after the new custom contracts system they will implement faction quests. Perhaps this will help with the new player retention by providing the beginners with something to do.

hopefully it should hit both ends, something for beginners & also something for those that have finished building their empire to do

Devs also plan an expansion of the politics. This is aimed at the late game players.

@everyone Take note of how Yaro decided to leave corp. If you ever decide that this game is not for you or you find yourself no longer wanting to play, that is perfectly fine. Please leave corp the correct way. At the very minimum, leave the corporation in game. We prefer that you transfer your goods to members within corp before you quit but that is not required. Failing to leave corp in game means all shareholders lose out on potential dividend earnings as your account would still be active and accruing your share, as well as leaving us with a potential gap in production that we are not aware we need to fill.

With that being said, your personal life needs to take priority over this game. We understand that and incorporate it into our strategies. My hope is that you all have as much fun playing this game as I do, and that being a member of OOG is a pleasurable experience, as we all share the same ultimate goal of being #spacerich!

Hey!


[06-May-22 11:23 AM] yang_mills#0000
Hello, @aegis76 ! Nice to see you here.


[06-May-22 11:23 AM] aegis76#0000
Thanks for the invite. Thought I'd check it out to see how it works


[06-May-22 11:27 AM] yang_mills#0000
Let the other know your company code, the location of your base and what you produce there.


[06-May-22 11:29 AM] aegis76#0000
My code is Vii and so far I produce AL on deimos


[06-May-22 11:30 AM] aegis76#0000
So what would be the benefit of joining? I can help produce AL but if I'm trading internally for a lower price how do I expand?


[06-May-22 11:31 AM] yang_mills#0000
You also are a supporter of the game at the planet level, aren't you?


[06-May-22 11:31 AM] aegis76#0000
Yes I've bought the pack about 2 weeks ago


[06-May-22 11:32 AM] yang_mills#0000
We also offer the basic prefabs at lower prices.


[06-May-22 11:34 AM] aegis76#0000
Do I have to commit to a certain amount or can I sell when I need money to expand and then when I have enough production trade internally


[06-May-22 11:38 AM] yang_mills#0000
Ask @insensless72 . He will explain you.

Welcome! Benefits to joining corp are access to goods below market value, immediate access to players who are interested in purchasing your product, access to help shipping goods between planets and help with expansion. For example, if you wanted to ramp up your AL production on Deimos, you could purchase bfabs from me at corp cost (600 BSE and 800 BBH for example.). We also have funds set aside to provide starting loans to players if that is something that interests you, as we find investing in players that will stick around to be more profitable in the long run for corp


[06-May-22 12:13 PM] insensless72#0000
All we ask is that if you decide this game or corp even is not for you, please leave it in game. We like to do a trial run for new players where you spend around 7 days in discord with us before joining in game. We find this works best, so you can feel out the Corp and the Corp can feel you out as a player. If after that trial is up, you decide you like the Corp and the game, we will officially invite you in game and you will begin receiving dividend payouts from our governor tax revenue


[06-May-22 12:15 PM] insensless72#0000
We have plenty of experienced players with us and new players as well. If you have any questions feel free to ask just about anyone

yea people sell bfabs fairly cheap here. Nike's the construction hub so typically that's where you'll need to go to pick them up.

Ok, I make ads for it but what is the price for BFabs on Nike


[09-May-22 08:48 AM] namthorn#0000
iirc the usual price is 600/u for BSE, 800/u for BDE/BBH and 500/u for BTA


[09-May-22 03:04 PM] insensless72#0000

[10-May-22 10:16 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
```heya~ I come today as an ambassador from ANTS. After some discussion, we have agreed that OOG is a large contributor to the prosperity and development of the Antares region, and as such, we have some interest in developing closer ties with you folks. I think we'd be happy to invite anyone interested to our affiliate channels in our discord, or (since we're smaller and likely less active) if you run one, we'd have our interested members join your discord to communicate and develop and general awareness of how we can better work together```

[10-May-22 10:18 AM] namthorn#0000
their affiliate channels aren't super active. I've been lurking there for months and there's been a grand total of 9 messages this year


[10-May-22 10:20 AM] namthorn#0000
i'd have to wonder what the purpose would be of something like this though, what can we discuss in a new channel that we can't do on the UFO discord currently?

Idk how I feel about them joining our discord. I feel as though that could get very messy very quickly. I am open to an affiliate channel outside of OBCM if they want to manage it


[10-May-22 12:06 PM] insensless72#0000
Collaboration for Antares is in all of our best interest, I just don't want OBCM to become their driving force for the changes they wish to see


[10-May-22 12:07 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
exactly. There are some powerhouse players in ants for sure, and they built the majority of this region in the early game, but i think they are looking to tap into our large scale ops here


[10-May-22 12:08 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
they did some similar outreach in the early game, and of course the timing was wrong at that point because we were still working on our first bases, counting pennies, etc.

Hello, thanks for the diplomatic outreach, it is appreciated üôÇ
We also see ourselves as a major economic player in the region, and take pride in our long standing local businesses/investments.
I have copy pasted your message directly to our corp discord with no edits so that everyone could comment. Our general consensus is that we are open to working with ANTs on for scoping and delivering on specific projects, but we are wary of spreading communications over multiple discords or bringing non-shareholders into our own.

Perhaps a single affiliate channel can be used for inviting OOG members and collaborating on a to-be-determined project```

@thummper is starting now with COF


[17-May-22 01:47 PM] thummper#0000
Will ramp up tomorrow when ship brings supplies but everything is set up


[17-May-22 01:50 PM] thummper#0000
Is 350 an okay price?


[17-May-22 01:51 PM] allocater#0000
yup that was the stable price before the shortage


[17-May-22 02:09 PM] thummper#0000
Think my cost is about 310 per unit DW cost is killing me a little


[17-May-22 02:09 PM] allocater#0000
you can get DW at 50


[17-May-22 02:10 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I can also provide cheap H2O on harmonia, I have rigs but nothing to consume the h2o


[17-May-22 02:11 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this puts more pressure on your FP but would stop you from getting killed on DW prices.


[17-May-22 02:11 PM] thummper#0000
I go through 365 H20/day also


[17-May-22 02:12 PM] thummper#0000
I will look at producing some DW as well and what the best recipe chain is for me


[17-May-22 02:13 PM] thummper#0000
Is worker consumption linear? Like i have 1 PIO uses 0.04 DW / RAT per day


[17-May-22 02:13 PM] thummper#0000
@ 1140 PIO


[17-May-22 02:13 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 1500 H2O now, and 115 per day. Also I can provide PG on harmonia to make DW more efficiently


[17-May-22 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this should fix it in the short term at least, yea?


[17-May-22 02:14 PM] thummper#0000
Yeah


[17-May-22 02:14 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also there is still allocaters cheap DW


[17-May-22 02:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
yes it is linear


[17-May-22 02:15 PM] thummper#0000
what do you sell h20 for?


[17-May-22 02:15 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
eh. I can go 10 each i think. Is this a good discount? I dont know what the prices normally are on harmonia Lm


[17-May-22 02:16 PM] allocater#0000
20


[17-May-22 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
wow what a scam


[17-May-22 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
should be 15


[17-May-22 02:16 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
anyways, 10 each from me, I dont want to ship it and have no good use for it.


[17-May-22 02:17 PM] thummper#0000
can I have it all?


[17-May-22 02:17 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
sure, all 1500


[17-May-22 02:18 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
and 150 PG if you like, 16 each

Hey all, anyone have or make RCO anywhere?


[20-May-22 11:23 AM] allocater#0000
I can make it on harmonia if orders come in


[20-May-22 12:53 PM] yang_mills#0000
Same answer. I can produce RCO on Harmonia.


[20-May-22 01:01 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I talked to allocater a bit already and placed an order with him, but I would be happy to buy an order from you as well. I make COT out of it so my plant would be dead if I run out - I'd rather have too much then not enough! No rush (I have some to last me at least another 10 days) but if you could make me 20-30 I would happily buy it off you!


[20-May-22 01:04 PM] yang_mills#0000
Ok. I can produce 20 RCO for you. How much do you pay per unit?


[20-May-22 01:06 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Thank you! Usually I buy off market for anywhere between like $475-$550. Right now the market is empty though, that's why I'm coming to corp.

We have @cazertanu doing something along those lines, but only 1-2 BMP


[23-May-22 07:48 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
it is a nice spot to make safety uniforms and overalls


[23-May-22 07:48 PM] churavis#0000
I looked at making safety uniforms but there didn't seem to be much of a market

very vertical, cool


[23-May-22 07:58 PM] churavis#0000
I try to follow the market and no one was selling RCO or COT


[23-May-22 07:58 PM] churavis#0000
Probably because it's way more profitable to just turn it into PWO


[23-May-22 07:59 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
that is a unique setup on harmonia. vertical RCO -> BMP products is a massive advantage over standard manufacturing


[23-May-22 07:59 PM] churavis#0000
That was the idea when I chose the planet as a new player


[23-May-22 08:00 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
with cheaper large scale PG/PE you could do alot with that business model


[23-May-22 08:01 PM] churavis#0000

indeed, this is what we do at large scale on deimos and nike, but AL smelting is the bottleneck

if you're just interested in profit, dumping PG into the market is a decent idea atm. Someone's bound to do it. Big holes in high-volume goods markets don't tend to last.


[26-May-22 09:52 AM] churavis#0000
Maybe, but PG products are up pretty high too, the CX has run out of PSL even

@allocater could you buy 50k AIC at like 0.98 ICA? is that bad for you?

hi all, my next base I want to get into H extraction because my REFs can eat wild amounts of it. For a planet that is gaseous and low temp what other materials will I need to build on it? (I was surprised by the SEA requirement when I expanded to Nike and didn't factor it into budget) This will be my first time expanding to a planet where I need some serious extra mats


[27-May-22 10:04 AM] namthorn#0000
gaseous = AEF instead of MCG, low temp = INS


[27-May-22 10:05 AM] namthorn#0000
ratios are listed here if you have your own base building sheets: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/building-costs/ prunner and the prebuilt base planning sheets autocalc how much you need

[27-May-22 10:07 AM] namthorn#0000
KI-401d is a good go-to


[27-May-22 10:07 AM] namthorn#0000
or ant IIg for a closer alternative with lower concentration

nah you're right about the close ones, logistics is also a factor


[27-May-22 10:08 AM] namthorn#0000
no use setting up a base if you can't transport the stuff


[27-May-22 10:11 AM] yjhasaday#0000
ummm I'm actually thinking of joining Mark on QJ-382g because it has lots of H but also a good amount of AMM for my REFs as well, its 3 jumps from ANT


[27-May-22 10:11 AM] namthorn#0000
2 for the price of 1, sounds like a plan.

@everyone big news this weekend for OOG!

First up: The "OOG 2000" FTL ship has been completed by our shipbuilding crew, and is ready for assembly on Hephaestus.

After much consideration, We have decided to give this ship to our very own @yang_mills , with shipbuilders paid out of the bank as if we had sold normally.

Yang has the greatest uncompensated contribution to OOG to date, and is among our most active players. Congrats Yang! üöÄ

I would like to thank the corp members for the trust. OOG 2000 is being built and will be ready in 24h. I consider calling it OOG 2000 - Tayra. Because Tayra is a Caldari hauler in EVE Online.

hyper power reactors, the full works


[28-May-22 01:35 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have looked into this. It requires einsteinium enrichment and some heavy AML, AST, APF work


[28-May-22 01:36 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
super expensive. I would be inclined to sell such a thing to the highest bidder, like the original FTL build


[28-May-22 01:37 PM] namthorn#0000
yea, is on the list, might just set up a temp base somewhere for a little LES next


[28-May-22 01:37 PM] namthorn#0000
most planets that have it are complete rubbish for a permanent permit


[28-May-22 01:38 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
With some planning and EES, and extra metal, money and time investment, we can build it.

@allocater in case you didnt see this. I am being serious


[28-May-22 01:43 PM] namthorn#0000
I'll work on the EEP next then. Need a couple of hq upgrades and then just need to figure out if the TSH or INS + HSE comes out cheaper, leaning towards INS + HSE as I have the HSE already


[28-May-22 01:45 PM] allocater#0000
doesn't seem like a problem from the end-chain, you just need to get the raw materials to heph üòÑ


[28-May-22 01:45 PM] allocater#0000
for AAF addons we obviously need to build AAF (again)


[28-May-22 02:12 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I still have the Afabs from tearing it down, just need a couple to replace the ones lost during operation - which is 1 of each Afab


[28-May-22 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
no good buyers for those STS, sadly


[28-May-22 02:20 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
but of course we put one of the STS on this hypothetical 9001 ship


[28-May-22 02:21 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I think the SPP is most notably absent.


[28-May-22 02:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
@namthorn this building has some flashy upgrades for ships, definitely value added. the operator needs kevlar and technetium


[28-May-22 02:22 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also of course the einsteinium situation


[28-May-22 02:26 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

[28-May-22 03:17 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Hello @everyone! Unfortunately RL stuff will be needing a lot more of my time in the next few months, so I'll be leaving the game within 2 weeks. Before that I'll need to hand over the SPF to somebody on Hephaestus, and most likely the PPFs as well. Also, if somebody wants to make a base on QJ-382g I can hand my stuff over there directly. If not I'll start shutting the base down next week and have everything shipped from there to ANT I planets and CX. Other bases I'll shut down the week after and when that is done all my inventories will be for grabs.

[28-May-22 03:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
Thank you for everything! I hope you will return later at some point. The game is about to become more interesting, and it will be worth to check it in a couple of month. Actually I wanted to build a base on QJ-382g. But right now I don't have a free permit. However, this should not take much time.


[28-May-22 03:39 PM] yang_mills#0000
@everyone Does anyone have 10 POW (Power Cell)? This is to upgrade my HQ.


[28-May-22 03:46 PM] spatial_piano#0000
Thanks for all the well wishes. I've had a great time with the game and the corp, and I'll definitely try to come back to the game when I have more free time. Next time I'll probably want to try food production, since it seems less time intensive and it's basically the only thing I haven't done in the game yet.

Here's the current QJ inventory. There's also a lot of BSEs, AEFs and INS reclaimable from the production buildings, so you can probably start with fabs for CM, some HB1s and a STO.

Background for consideration:
I'm a cloud developer, based in EST (Florida  :rip:)
My most active hours are before 8am EST and after 7:30pm EST. I tend to check in during lunch/meetings but can't conversate much during that time.

I'm interested in founding a planet in the long distance future, but my immediate goals is vertically integrating the metallurgy industry with a sight on ship production and shipping itself.

You found the right place my friend. Im EST as well and I teach so I am inactive throughout the day. All we require from you is friendly banter, cooperation and that you leave corp in game if you decide its not for you. Otherwise, play and expand at your own pace.

I told @demannu That we do a 7 day trial period, this allows you to feel out the corp and the corp to feel you out as a player. After that you will be officially invited to the corp in game. All we ask is that you keep it friendly, collaborate and leave corp in game if you decide it isnt for you.


[31-May-22 10:22 PM] insensless72#0000
Other than that, play and expand at your own pace and have fun! We have many veteran players and inexperienced players both so if you have any questions feel free to reach out to just about anyone


[31-May-22 10:25 PM] exeler#0000
Awesome, that sounds great! I've been playing pretty passively so far. Got everything set up to make 40 carbon every 3 days, and just checking in very occasionally. Was hoping to save up to build some new buildings so that there'd be slightly more to look at each time I log in.

If carbon is in demand, I don't mind just adding more farms and incinerators to contribute more than just a small drop.

[31-May-22 10:26 PM] insensless72#0000

[01-Jun-22 11:03 AM] allocater#0000
sure (I don't know which way, but both ways is fine üòÑ ) sell 1 DW for x


[01-Jun-22 12:00 PM] exeler#0000
Is there a "best" recipe for the incinerator to use?

Looks like most of them seem to either make a trade off for speed vs efficiency. 

I've been using the fast recipe that burns a lot of resources, but I was wondering if that was a bad idea. 

I produce the crops myself, so the only input I need to buy right now is H20 and the materials to keep my pioneers running the farms and incinerator happy. 

I figure the pioneer supplies cost a great deal more than the water I use as input so optimizing for the most carbon/day even though I don't have any excess crops to sell is best for now. I haven't done the math though, so this is just speculation.


[01-Jun-22 12:01 PM] exeler#0000
I figure if I build another incinerator I can drop down to a slower, more efficient recipe so that I just end up making more carbon over time with the same h20 input. So there's leeway on balancing my farm to incinerator ratio.


[01-Jun-22 12:02 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
if you plan to be max base size on vertical carbon, the recipe that you end up going with will determine your ratio of RIG, FRM and INC


[01-Jun-22 12:03 PM] allocater#0000
I did a napkin table a while back and the fast recipe was indeed the most profit per day. So if you can get the resources you can continue to run it I think


[01-Jun-22 12:03 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
In my experience, the middle recipe is the best, but. i always fall back on the slow recipe if there is risk of a water or agriculture shortage


[01-Jun-22 12:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the fast recipe has the highest profits if you have no limit to affordable agriculture supply


[01-Jun-22 12:04 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
this is a big ‚Äúif‚Äù


[01-Jun-22 12:06 PM] exeler#0000
That makes sense since the incinerator seems to be the slowest link in the chain. 

Right now I found a sweet spot where my two FRM can produce just enough crops to feed the fast recipe for carbon so that I can queue orders of 40 C that complete every 3 days.


[01-Jun-22 12:07 PM] demannu#0000
Also, make use of that calc spreadsheet I sent you @exeler it breaks down the base building + recipe ROI


[01-Jun-22 12:08 PM] exeler#0000
I'll have to take a look at it more. I've only glossed over it so far


[01-Jun-22 12:08 PM] allocater#0000
right, at some point crop value can get so high that the highest profitability jumps to another recipe


[01-Jun-22 12:10 PM] exeler#0000
That makes sense. If someone trying to by truckloads of crops at insane prices it probably makes sense to sell the crops directly instead of burning them to try and sell them in the form of cheap ash.

I think CORPFIN has a ton of potential in future versions of the game. Investment funds like Metal Trust could be done there. In its current state though its pretty useless. Really all it does is tell you when the next dividend payout will be and allow you to calculate your own share

what is your biggest money maker not including that phobos fund?


[06-Jun-22 11:43 AM] yang_mills#0000
1) Bfabs. 2) Hull plates 3) LST 4) MCG 5) FLX 6) SIO 7) Occasional sells of metals. Actually both Bfabs and hull plates are very vertically integrated. These are the ends of long chains. Actually a large portion of this income comes from smelters, extractors and collectors, an other one from my farms and food processors. Also one should count in the contribution of the BMPs.


[06-Jun-22 12:02 PM] yang_mills#0000
What I try to say is that a big portion of the added value is generated by the AL on Deimos. Just I don't usually trade the AL and it goes instead into the Bfabs and the hull plates.


[06-Jun-22 12:05 PM] yang_mills#0000
The extraction of LST also generates a lot of added value, which goes into Bfabs, MCG, FLX or gets directly traded on the CX. Finally, the last step of manufacturing the Bfabs in PP2 and PP1 creates a lot of added value because the Bfabs are so high at the moment.

Yes. That is what I would recommend to newer players. Set up your bases on Deimos and Nike. Spam AL on Deimos, ship it to Nike and spam Bfabs there.


[06-Jun-22 01:03 PM] yang_mills#0000
It seems that the Bfabs will start going down quickly though, because the wave of new players is behind us.

if you're going full PG it's probably better on qj-650c. just for the proximity to ANT. Griffonstone is more attractive if you want to use the local HAL. Lots of very useful chemicals take CL.

I can fly up to 300 m3 out to Nike with me if some of you would like to pick up there instead. If you would like some feel free to post ads (give me a couple days to fill since I'm not sure exactly when the Tayra will land). Hopefully I can bring down prices as I get more experts and figure things out!

Yep, you can post an ad and I'll fill once it arrives (give it a couple days to fill). You're looking on Phobos right? I only have space for 200 on the ship to Deimos

[09-Jun-22 06:33 PM] namthorn#0000
for an INC spam world to work you would need to ideally be in the same system as where you'd be using the C, as well as close proximity to a source of crops. Could then maybe make the C shipping work using glass ship convoys. But that's a hell of an investment for something as trivial as C.


[09-Jun-22 06:36 PM] namthorn#0000
1st question to answer would be "can you actually feed an entire base of INC with enough crops running the fastest recipe + experts + cogc?"


[09-Jun-22 06:36 PM] namthorn#0000
that sounds like a hell of a lot of crops to burn to me


[09-Jun-22 09:16 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Are any of you making C on @Demeter? I've been considering moving my C operation there so I could expand it (right now I rely on importing the crops and I already spend a lot of timing sourcing them - I don't think Deimos is fertile enough to grow on site). It looks like the soil is fertile enough to grow crops on KI-446b? But as DLR noted transporting it is the biggest drawback

Right now I've got one base on Phobos where I'm doing Fuel, B and L prefabs, BCO and a bit of excess CU.  I've been solo since starting 3 weeks ago, so have been going for whatever the best accessible profits are.  Looking at PG production to do PSLs later for a second base, but I'm open to specializing better if I can find affordable supplies to do so.  I have been enjoying trying to maximize my profits per minute per square and expanding asap

Where do you want to put your second base?


[10-Jun-22 10:13 AM] insensless72#0000
PG production on Phobos would both help corp and bring in some $$$. Dont expand into PSLs as we can supply those for you. 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit?usp=sharing
That link will take you to our corporate spreadsheet. You can see what we have established and get yourself set up on there. You will also find corp prices on the prices page. 
Just an FYI, we do a 7 day trial period where you can hangout and enjoy the benefits of being in corp before we officially invite you in game. During this period the only thing you will not have access to are dividend payouts from our tax revenue

Still determining that.  Was considering BS-788c for CLI to produce I and then convert that into MHL at a WEL, but I'm already experiencing light shipping capacity issues, so that's something I'm thinking through


[10-Jun-22 10:14 AM] jackinabox86#0000
either way, I'm only at 183 area on my first base, so a second base is a ways off


[10-Jun-22 10:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
you are importing copper right? sounds heavy


[10-Jun-22 10:14 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm certainly down to do PG as it's a the top of my plan sheet right now!


[10-Jun-22 10:14 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
also, no requirement to max one base before getting another. all things being equal, more experts earlier is better


[10-Jun-22 10:14 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm making the copper actually because the supply was expensive and small.  Ore is not light either


[10-Jun-22 10:16 AM] jackinabox86#0000
My issue with a new base was the 90k or so I projected it requiring in capitol, plus buildings.  Sounds like i might be able to source that easier here

I just have one SME that produces enough for a BCO line.  That has been $6.5k profit a day in BCO at the CX, plus some extra CU to sell.  If I'm able to buy prefabs from you all, that means I can stop shipping in LST and FE to help with my expansion needs


[10-Jun-22 10:27 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I don't think BCO is a permanent solution, but I have been lucky to find it since it was relatively easy to get into and has provided steady, good income


[10-Jun-22 10:27 AM] namthorn#0000
there are bfab stocks around . Also cheap LST on Nike & cheap AL (pp2 bfab recipes) on Deimos.

[10-Jun-22 10:28 AM] namthorn#0000
and yea market gaps appear. it's more future-proofing. if you're already having shipping issues now imagine the problems when you have more bases


[10-Jun-22 10:30 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I had to source my own copper, but even with PE relatively high, I've consistently made at least $6k a day.  Was making less when I bought copper, but the whole line only takes 50 pioneers and 50 settlers

[10-Jun-22 02:49 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
HMS is a niche one. Probably best to produce it along side other products. Total volume is pretty low compared to pioneer/settler consumables


[10-Jun-22 02:50 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000

Hi @everyone. Last things I have to do is to dump my remaining items on ANT, and then leave my money for the bank. In 1-2 hours I'll dump AMM, FF and SWF to highest bidders, so If you need any of these Items for cheap, you can put up a buy at a price you think works for you. The amounts are here:

I'm looking to build some more stuff (RIG, INC, FRM) on Harmonia, and I'm looking to buy the materials listed below (`Material: amount (total_cost)`). I saw some prices listed for these around in other channels, do the totals look right?

Where should I make the ads to buy these? I've currently got a ship on Deimos and at Antares Station.

```yaml
BSE: 24 (14400)
BBH: 11 (8800)
BTA: 1 (600)
BDE: 2 (1600)

Does anyone have a base with 2 STO? Can 2 of them be justified? I thought it wouldn't be worth the space but its only 15 area and my Nike base has a lot of heavy stuff stocked. Between LST extraction, AL stores for PP2s, large amounts of fuel, heavy fuel inputs like GAL and even AMM/H, and 24 hour MCG production my base is getting close to the limit but I don't want to thin out any of these things üò≠

Hey all, we've had quite a few newer players join recently (and maybe some older ones that might not know about it) so I thought I would give a quick plug to FIO because its a life saver. If you go to https://fio.fnar.net/ you will find a tool that is operated by Saganaki (one of the game's devs), you can connect your PrUn account to it and it will offer you real time base data. The tool I use the most is the burn rate of my bases - it calculates exactly how many days I have left of each consumable and highlights it as a warning when low, I'll post a screen grab below. 

The other tool I use often is the planet search - here you can search for planets with a certain resource/COGC/atmospheric conditions/infrastructure/fertility/etc and sort them by distance to ANT (or whichever other column you wish). This is how I found QJ-382g where I now have a base. 

The site offers plenty of other tools as well - such as inventory, maps, building upkeep + shopping list, trade/shipment finder, and price info. I don't use any of these but, to those that use FIO, let me know if you recommend giving one of them a real try!

I would like to also to submit a suggestion for KI-446b name: Kahuna. It is a reference to our corp name! 

"Kahuna" is a Hawai'ian word that means leader in a specific field, in the 2001 Dreamcast game "Ooga Booga" it was the title used for playable characters. Link to the game's Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ooga_Booga

Ooga Booga
Ooga Booga is an online multiplayer video game for the Dreamcast, focusing on the combat of "Kahunas" using thrown shrunken heads, riding animals, staffs, or using spells. The game received positive reviews from video game critics. "Ooga Booga" is also a popular Roblox game.

I think it's a property allocated on company creation. not sure if you even need to settle there. That said, I doubt he flew all the way from MOR to ANT starting out so insenseless is probably right on the money.

well yea, what else would we do with all the excess ALO? delicious deimos crunch!


[24-Jun-22 12:31 PM] namthorn#0000
my reason for thinking company creation is that you get assinged a certain amount of $ in a particular faction's currency before you've even settled. It's a guess but I;d wager as soon as you make the company, it uses whatever affiliation the planet you chose is to determine  the denomination of the lion's share of currency. So it would be possible to start in NCE, fly to MOR, buy out supplies, fly to say, deimos and settle but still get the NCE affiliation despite never settling there.


[24-Jun-22 12:35 PM] dersix#0000
ok, for me starting planet was linked to company creation as it's pretty rare to have someone starting  and first doing a round-trip üôÇ

Makes sense, thanks for the answers!


[26-Jun-22 01:05 AM] exeler#0000
I'm a professional software developer, and definitely not a professional spreadsheet wizard like some of y'all seem to be. These super awesome google sheets you guys go way beyond my spreadsheet-fu.

So I started writing some scripts that crunch numbers for me similar to how the gsheets are used, but to help me answer some slightly different questions than I could get out of the gsheets (editing the sheets is well beyond my current ability). I wrote (the start of, it is FAR from complete) a base io calculator that lets you put in facilities, recipes, and a reference timeframe (want to calculate 1 day, 2 weeks, a month?) and it spits out the expected required inputs and the outputs over that timeframe. I haven't added the info for workforce supplies like RAT or DW yet (mostly because that's already available in game if you've built the base already). 

```
$ python main.py 
Running Base(INC(4)-FRM(8)-RIG(1)) with [HCP(4)-MAI(2)-GRN(2) -> C(4), H2O(3) -> GRN(12), H2O(6) -> HCP(12), H2O(6) -> HCP(12), H2O(4) -> MAI(12), _ -> H2O(6)] for days=1 hours=0 minutes=0:
        - -7.751 HCP
        - -1.885 MAI
        - -3.875 GRN
        + 44.912 C
        - -6.281 H2O
```
Example output for my current base on Harmonia. I haven't done any rigorous testing yet, but these values feel pretty close to what I'm observing.

I eventually want to make this script compute the most efficient recipes to use and best ratio of buildings to maximize a specific output while minimizing required inputs.

If anyone else is interested, I can open source the code somewhere and/or turn it into an easy to use site.


[26-Jun-22 03:07 AM] allocater#0000

[26-Jun-22 05:18 AM] domicius#0000
Which means that you can also go to the FIO Discord and talk to the guys there. FIO is kinda a collaborative effort, but also the guys on the Discord are always talking algorithms


[26-Jun-22 05:19 AM] domicius#0000
I think where an algorithm can help a lot is with making and scheduling complex outputs that l require a lot of steps in processing. Hit me up and I'll tell you how I need to calculate making software

[26-Jun-22 11:41 AM] domicius#0000
OK thanks. I'll look to expanding my base on KI-840c and get this going.


[26-Jun-22 12:03 PM] yang_mills#0000
Well, I already produce SOI. Perhaps there is room for two producers.


[26-Jun-22 12:09 PM] domicius#0000
Not trying to cut into your action. Just I've got the CHPs and the BRM, and it seems that there's only a small need in the Corp. Otherwise I can just keep shipping BRM


[26-Jun-22 12:10 PM] yang_mills#0000
We need 300 SOI (200 on Phobos, 50 on Nike and 50 on Griff) every 10 days, that is 30 SOI per day. Where are your CHPs located?


[26-Jun-22 12:10 PM] domicius#0000
KI-840c


[26-Jun-22 12:12 PM] yang_mills#0000
It's a question of shipping. Is it more efficient to move BRM to QJ-650c or CLI to KI-840c, given that BRM and CLI have almost the same weight, but one does need twice as much BRM?


[26-Jun-22 12:13 PM] domicius#0000
Good point! More efficient to ship the CLI I guess?


[26-Jun-22 12:14 PM] domicius#0000
I'm building out the CHPs anyway to double REA for the POPI on Phobos. Hence my investigation this way.


[26-Jun-22 12:16 PM] yang_mills#0000
It depends where. Yes, BRM takes twice as much space. But one will have to ship CLI QJ-650c -> KI-840c, then SOI KI-840c->Phobos. The other option is BRM  KI-840c->QJ-650c and SOI QJ-650c->Phobos, and QJ-650 is on the way from KI-840c to Phobos. In the first case the shipment takes less space but travels a longer distance.


[26-Jun-22 12:19 PM] domicius#0000
Actually, we'd probably use Phobos as the hub (ship to-from) which can use the big ships.


[26-Jun-22 12:20 PM] domicius#0000
This is what we do right now effectively


[26-Jun-22 12:20 PM] domicius#0000
The question is whether me making SOI allows you to specialise in other areas


[26-Jun-22 12:21 PM] yang_mills#0000
@domicius I can sell you CLI at 130 AIC/u. Right now I have 96 in stock on QJ-650c.


[26-Jun-22 12:21 PM] yang_mills#0000
I produce PG on QJ-650c.


[26-Jun-22 12:26 PM] exeler#0000
This sounds like a really cool idea, and one I think that the behind-the-scenes abstractions I put together might be able to tackle relatively easily. 

I've only got a couple hours effort in my tool so far, so I'm not ready to try and add support for more complex pipelines yet, but I'm hoping to flesh it out more as I find time to work on. 

Gotta work on removing all the hard coded parameters like recipe durations and instead calculate them based on the base times and efficiencies before I start trying to make more general purpose or complex things üòÖ


[26-Jun-22 12:33 PM] domicius#0000
It's your call I'd say. I'll be a week getting a new permit and building out CHPs and EXTs. I'll do it for the REAs anyway.


[26-Jun-22 12:37 PM] yang_mills#0000
Let me know when you are ready. I will have more CLI at that time.


[26-Jun-22 12:37 PM] allocater#0000
Are you sure we need more REA? My demand will steadily decline as the production line decays, so you can shift that to other things.


[26-Jun-22 12:49 PM] domicius#0000
@bitcoin_ape  wants 1k every 10 days for Phobos.  Otherwise I wouldnt be expanding I think.

[26-Jun-22 01:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
as you can see, my capacity is pretty limited. if we had dedicated SOI production on somebody elses base, and the SOI ultimately made it to Phobos, I could focus more on NS and PFE

employers should not tolerate any violation against work law, so if an employee is violating rules, the employer can/should admonish them

for the reality... it depends on the company üôÇ

@rune_242 lets discuss ship upgrade here instead of the strategy chat


[06-Jul-22 07:41 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
the cost of the ship upgrade depends on what item you upgrade. I dont think there is any tax or cash needed. You just need to bring your ship to a shipyard along with the ship components that you want to use


[07-Jul-22 05:32 AM] domicius#0000
It makes it easier to set up shop at least. And since people will be looking to upgrade all sorts of stuff, it should drive demand. Probably for bigger holds and engines


[07-Jul-22 11:49 AM] rune_242#0000
how much will the parts cost?

@allocater calculated it out the other day WCB + LFE + 25 SSC + 16 BHP I think it was

gives you the 3000t/1000m^3 hold

How much is that for external and how much with corp prices?


[07-Jul-22 04:49 PM] namthorn#0000
no idea on either lol. That's just the parts required to upgrade a standard ship to the 3k ton hauler with no extras.


[07-Jul-22 04:50 PM] namthorn#0000
dont think we sell parts in corp atm (apart from hull plates) as there's no reason to, but with the move to upgradable ships i have no doubt on that being possible.

Nah, we just divide the other galaxy into shares and sell/fight over them. Who actually cares about getting there if you can just claim you own it?

@everyone with Technicians. So I've got my CLF up and producing HMS on Hephaestus. I have 30 available there and am currently transporting some to my base on Deimos, with 40 available there in about half a day. 750/u both places. On that note as well, I'm not seeing any GC on the market right now, so if anyone with a WEL wants to make those, I will buy them. Also looking to source CUO or CU but that's a lower priority for the moment

Damn.  They already got ship upgrades ready to go for the next release.  Hopefully that'll be in real soon!


[11-Jul-22 09:13 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Molp says they're aiming for August


[11-Jul-22 10:32 AM] insensless72#0000
As in they're flipping the universe next month?


[11-Jul-22 11:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
No.  Just implementing whatever features.  I assume custom contracts and ship upgrades are the two major ones


[11-Jul-22 11:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
he used the word release and said August; I'm sure he would have been very explicit if they anticipated a universe reset


[11-Jul-22 11:23 AM] jackinabox86#0000
would be sort of amusing if thye only gave 24 hours notice for something like that.  Everyone has to scramble to plan, etc.


[11-Jul-22 11:25 AM] insensless72#0000
I joined right after the last reset so im interested to see how they go about that myself. I do know that when they flip it, it starts out random(ish) so its hard to plan for


[11-Jul-22 11:26 AM] jackinabox86#0000
sure, but presumably we'd want to pick a starting area as a group and have some sort of break down into who is going to go into what initial profession, etc.


[11-Jul-22 11:27 AM] jackinabox86#0000

I wonder if it's based on how many positive vs negative periods you have. 

If you tend to only sell large quantities far apart rather than selling a steady stream, the game might see more red periods than green?

mine is always green though and has dropped to B in the past despite that

Sweet! Just a heads up, we like to do a 7 day trial period where you get to feel us out as a corp and the corp gets to feel you out as a player. During that period feel free explore and access anything in our Discord to your hearts content. After that period you will receive an invite in game and receive corp dividend payments. All we ask is that if you decide the game isnt for you or if you're losing interest, leave the corporation in game.

We have many players new and experienced both so if you have any questions feel free to reach out and ask.

ASMs are a good move if you have the SME capacity to back them up. We could probably use 2 more. The problem with Alloys is that they dont sell on the CX, so youd also have to go SKF and make LCB WCB etc

[20-Jul-22 11:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Is that a sale of  ~100 MHL at 2900? But the candlestick "wick" goes up to 4k, so transactions occurred at that price too during those two trading windows?


[20-Jul-22 11:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Wikipedia says: "Wicks illustrate the highest and lowest traded prices of an asset during the time interval represented" so maybe someone was buying at 4k and re-selling at 2900 to fill the requests?


[20-Jul-22 11:54 PM] churavis#0000
Somene sold 204,000 AIC worth of MHL at the highest bid price, so probably around 70 for 2900. Then someone else bough 146,600 AIC worth of MHL at the lowest ask price, so probably around 37 MHL


[20-Jul-22 11:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
that's the red and the green line respectively, then?

i like co op games and that is a nice distraction while waiting for the buildings to produce :)

[23-Jul-22 08:19 AM] domicius#0000
I'm doing a lot of games.... Occasionally. Mainly because I play PU


[23-Jul-22 08:40 AM] churavis#0000
What, you can't spend all your free time optimizing expansion plans, creating complex profit calculation spreadsheets and fiddling with the UI?


[23-Jul-22 09:30 AM] domicius#0000
Real work cuts into my expansion planning severely :(
But I spend most of my gaming on PU - it's my favourite thing.

Think I answered my own question but I coulda swore I've seen buy/sell ads up on thre ANT LM


[24-Jul-22 02:14 PM] emperyan11#0000
Oh well


[24-Jul-22 02:20 PM] churavis#0000
Personally I think they should allow buy/sell ads on the cx lm, I can't think of why you wouldn't.


[24-Jul-22 02:23 PM] namthorn#0000
I don't think it would be conducive to trade personally. It would effectively allow pro players to undercut the market without actually making their undercut visible to the wider playerbase


[24-Jul-22 02:24 PM] namthorn#0000
on planets its fine because you usually only get certain things produced in certain planets, but to have a generic hub where you could do that, I think it would be kinnda unfair.


[24-Jul-22 02:24 PM] churavis#0000
Why would pro players want to undercut the market when they could sell for more on the cx?


[24-Jul-22 02:25 PM] churavis#0000
The cx would be free as well


[24-Jul-22 02:25 PM] namthorn#0000
if you undercut the ask but not the bid i mean


[24-Jul-22 02:25 PM] namthorn#0000
it would create this weird secondary market on the station


[24-Jul-22 02:26 PM] churavis#0000
I don't see why they would want to pay fees to sell on the lm when when they could sell it faster on the cx for free


[24-Jul-22 02:27 PM] churavis#0000
Outside of corp or other special circumstances, LM ads generally follow the CX


[24-Jul-22 02:28 PM] namthorn#0000
it could lead to degenerate behaviour imo. i quite like it as this place where everyone can see everything that is for sale and must compete to sell there


[24-Jul-22 02:29 PM] churavis#0000
LM is riskier too so if you don't have the shipping advantage then even pro players would likely prefer the cx outside of corp transfers


[24-Jul-22 02:29 PM] namthorn#0000
and LM ads dont have to follow the CX, i've bought and sold both lower and higher than the CX at times.


[24-Jul-22 02:30 PM] namthorn#0000
on quite a few occasions


[24-Jul-22 02:32 PM] namthorn#0000
it also makes it more laborious to multi account, you cant just buy a bunch of stuff immediately, sell it to yourslef for 1 then never touch the account again. you have to spend a good 12hr round trip on it


[24-Jul-22 02:32 PM] namthorn#0000
there's also the design decision to think about - they moved the CX from planets where you had this exact functionality for a reason


[24-Jul-22 02:33 PM] namthorn#0000
im sure it was a good one

Do we get any breakdown of corporate income? I'd like to see how much income my new planet is generating but it seems like I can set the local rules and have zero information about what actually is getting collected


[28-Jul-22 10:36 AM] rune_242#0000
there 26 000 shares in the corp


[28-Jul-22 10:36 AM] rune_242#0000
last time you would get 21.88 AIC per share


[28-Jul-22 10:37 AM] rune_242#0000
that was 568 880 AIC in total

thats 1.12 AIC more per share
with 26 000 shares thats 29 120 AIC more taxes in total


[28-Jul-22 10:38 AM] churavis#0000
How many totally inactive corp members are there?


[28-Jul-22 10:39 AM] rune_242#0000
so your planet would make almost 30k AIC per week


[28-Jul-22 10:39 AM] insensless72#0000
I know of 3


[28-Jul-22 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Well, not so much about the amount I receive, but instead the amount my new planet collects. I'm not sure if my planet makes 1k or 100k a week


[28-Jul-22 10:40 AM] churavis#0000
There really needs to be functionality for kicking members of a Corp, beyond just starting a whole new one


[28-Jul-22 10:40 AM] archielvahr#0000
I feel like natural weekly variation in a planet like Harmonia exceeds the total income of QJ-650c


[28-Jul-22 10:41 AM] insensless72#0000
This is why I stress so seriously that people leave if they drop off. 1/4 do so


[28-Jul-22 10:41 AM] insensless72#0000
Once theyre in corp I have no means of kicking until the game does it for us


[28-Jul-22 10:41 AM] insensless72#0000
that takes like 1-2 months


[28-Jul-22 10:41 AM] insensless72#0000
longer if they log in once


[28-Jul-22 10:42 AM] churavis#0000
Would it be better to have a voting mechanism or an admin mechanism for ejecting players?


[28-Jul-22 10:43 AM] insensless72#0000
Voting would probably be best, but it depends on how you want to structure the corp as well


[28-Jul-22 10:44 AM] insensless72#0000
2/3 vote would probably be sufficient to prevent coups


[28-Jul-22 10:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
We could send polite reminders via discord to people who we suspect are inactive. Remind them they are welcome back if they become active again later


[28-Jul-22 10:47 AM] rune_242#0000
one corp member is a friend from real live


[28-Jul-22 10:47 AM] rune_242#0000
just send him a text to know if he's still active


[28-Jul-22 10:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
I imagine a lot people who go inactive intend to leave the corp, and just forget about the game entirely one day


[28-Jul-22 10:50 AM] insensless72#0000
I do send polite reminders to leave the corp in game. I feel like it goes back to waht you just said Archiel, they stop playing one day and then cant be bothered to log in and leave

Speaking of which, why don't we create a new corp and switch to that one?


[28-Jul-22 10:59 AM] churavis#0000
Wouldn't we have to build a new hq?


[28-Jul-22 11:00 AM] allocater#0000
right


[28-Jul-22 11:00 AM] insensless72#0000
Also the game kicks inactive players periodically, all that really has to be done is wait


[28-Jul-22 11:03 AM] churavis#0000
What if the corp automatically inherited the money of kicked off players?


[28-Jul-22 11:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
they don't really lose anything by being kicked, and a coup doesn't really benefit someone, so the bar to remove someone should be low


[28-Jul-22 11:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
see if we did Churavis's idea, we'd really be in business and a high bar would be needed!


[28-Jul-22 11:04 AM] namthorn#0000
only thing they lose is the buy-in, but that can always just be deducted from the corp balance as part of it.


[28-Jul-22 11:04 AM] namthorn#0000
so you get your shares bought back effectively


[28-Jul-22 11:05 AM] jackinabox86#0000
isn't the buy in for us like 1k


[28-Jul-22 11:05 AM] namthorn#0000
yea, it's nothing atm


[28-Jul-22 11:05 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I don't disagree with you; was just curious


[28-Jul-22 11:05 AM] namthorn#0000
but if they actually want to ever go via the shares system in future for corps i think something like that would work.


[28-Jul-22 11:06 AM] jackinabox86#0000
it would be very cool if we could have a true ownership system, etc.  corps as is are fun because of the community, but don't really add anything to the gameplay


[28-Jul-22 11:07 AM] namthorn#0000
you kinda do, it's just more like a privately owned Ltd firm


[28-Jul-22 11:07 AM] namthorn#0000
share price never really changes because it's whatever you say it is.


[28-Jul-22 11:08 AM] namthorn#0000
agree on more gameplay things thoough

I hope you're right


[28-Jul-22 11:14 AM] namthorn#0000
there was mention of changes to politics on the plan in the earlier stream today so maybe corps will be rolled into that?

[30-Jul-22 11:19 PM] churavis#0000

Good news everyone! I finally caught up with the backlog of corp orders for H on QJ-382g and I just finished filling up the 2003 with H/AMM for my own needs so the next batch of H is up for grabs. Currently enough available to fill a standard 500 ship, if anyone wants to send out a 2000 then you will have to hold off for a couple days. If no one is interested then I will send the 2003 out again in 3 days, I'll offer the load around the corp first then bring to CX

I am switching to a BASIC subscription today (in 4 hours) . I want to try it out, and see how it feels, for a month. If I keep playing PrUn as much as I am now, in a month, or maybe sooner if I get itchy, then I will renew my subscription. I am someone who cannot stand signing up for game subscriptions, but obviously I am playing PrUn daily, so I realize it is totally worth it. Just out of my own principles, I need to stick to my plan of trying the BASIC for a while.  I recognize this will make it more inconvenient to do trades with Kowa-Bunga, so for that I apologize! üòõ  I have tried to set up my operations so that it is good to just sit and accumulate wealth (and pay off your 20-day contracts), without needing many more LM materials. We'll see how it goes.

I love the game and happy to subscribe, but they should really lower the price of PRO so that more people sign up.  $8 a month is decently steep and I think it deters people from just paying $3 or something like that.  They'd probably make more money at a lower amount.  It would also mean we wouldn't have to do all the posting for people on BASIC!


[05-Aug-22 10:46 AM] allocater#0000
yeah 8‚Ç¨ is like a real MMO subscription with graphics etc. This is just a text browser game

If you get your HQ to level 5 you get 2 more queue slots on everything - it helps quite a bit. Also I don't think Basic allows the use of "recurring" orders (someone correct me if I'm wrong) which I would definitely miss so keep that in mind.

Hi @OOG Shareholder , sadly I have to say goodbye. Real life is too demanding, and I realize I was in denial this past month about my ability to continue playing games (including prun). At the end of the day, my brain is too tired for more numbers and logic-y work.

I am very proud of what we have all accomplished in this game, and I think you might see me again sometime. I might also make an appearance in discord on occasion. Honestly I feel sad typing this message, because I have put so much time in to this corporation and have become virtual friends with many of you. This is not time wasted, though. Much fun was had, ships produced, and money spent, and I would do it over again the same way.

As for the business details, @churavis has the password to my account including my current inventory.

@namthorn is holding most of the money with instructions to deliver it to @allocater 

Best of luck to you all.

Welcome! Glad you could make it! Don't worry about offering low prices - especially if you are in construction. We are actually in discussions on updating our corp prices so that everyone can sell without losing money. 
I would suggest Deimos as your next spot to expand to - we can always use more smelters in corp and you would be able to supply yourself with your own AL. I think we should have a pretty consistent supply of C from Demeter soon too so the high CX price shouldn't be an issue. I think Hortus or Etherwind are a little far for a second base - I'm glad my bases are pretty close together, just makes logistics so much easier üôÇ


[11-Aug-22 07:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
What I was worried about before was whether there was a stable carbon with the right price. The excessive price of carbon severely squeezed the profits of metallurgical industry.

[11-Aug-22 07:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
But harmonia's soil fertility and water source are not dominant. I'm thinking that if I get food, drinking water and carbon through production and procurement in Hortus, their prices have a great advantage over those in AI area. And the Construction Prefabs in AI area can make a big profit when transported to IC area, so it becomes a high-profit route. And considering that food, drinking water and Construction Prefabs only take up less capacity, this is even more advantageous.@yjhasaday

If you want to run that route to Hortus then feel free to do so! I'm just suggesting that you try keeping it local and see if the supply chains that our corp has already built can sustain you. You will find much better prices within the corp on agricultural goods from Harmonia - I believe that RAT and DW go for around 50-55 AIC among corp members.


[11-Aug-22 07:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
I will definitely set up an industrial chain in deimos, phobos and Hephaestus in the future. I just feel a little embarrassed to ask harmonia's friends to provide agricultural products at low prices. I have built a farm there before, and I feel that the profit is really meager.@yjhasaday


[11-Aug-22 07:54 AM] insensless72#0000
Most of us are vertical and the low prices are meant to be taken advantage of! You're not asking theyre offering. Also I am willing to provide you with a 200k interest free liquid investment package if you would like.


[11-Aug-22 07:55 AM] insensless72#0000
If interested simply post a sell ad on Nike for 1 DW @ 200k


[11-Aug-22 08:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
Ok, I will make good use of this money. Considering that I have upgraded my base to 2, I can set up bases in horus and deimos at the same time. Of course, in the short term, it is more profitable to use funds for long-distance trade. Thank you for your help!

Quite a few people feel hesitant to take advantage of the corp deals when they first join but you'll get used to it soon. Perhaps its because it seems too good to be true üòÖ but it is! The benefit is mutual - those that are offering the discounted prices also get great deals from others in the corp on inputs and other materials/products they import. Also they should still be making money when they sell to you so everyone wins!


[11-Aug-22 10:59 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Also in case you might be confused: "ZDLR" or "Zombie DLR" is the name for our founder who has recently had real life commitments cause him to step away from the game. He's been nice enough to offer up his account to us because a lot of us relied on him in our supply chains. So that's what we're referring to when you see those names

@churavisI have calculated that if I purchase Al and NL at the internal price and then sell LDE at the internal price, my profit will indeed be higher than that of producing BDE through PP1. I made a table to calculate the profit, cost and quantity of each production line according to the price of CX before. It seems that I need to update a version according to the internal price.

What is the main purpose of FE? I will buy some FE from cx at a low price at the beginning, and then produce it into BSE through PP1 and sell it. This is my first bucket of gold. However, according to the difficulty and price of mining FEO in AI area, it seems unprofitable to produce FE.


[11-Aug-22 09:42 PM] churavis#0000
FE is more expensive than in other factions but you can produce it on Antares II b if you have access to HSE


[11-Aug-22 09:46 PM] yuen8241#0000
I mean the significance of FE to us. I feel that the greatest significance of FE is to produce steel and then make PT.


[11-Aug-22 09:46 PM] churavis#0000
I do that too


[11-Aug-22 09:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have set up an account in Antares II b before, but I find it too difficult to expand production capacity because HSE is too expensive. Therefore, I think Antares II b is suitable for the metallurgical industry to fill the short board in the later period.


[11-Aug-22 09:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
At the beginning, it was more profitable to sell FEO, but it was boring and a waste of capacity.

It is not a good first planet but it's great for supporting higher tier industries. The corp certainly seems grateful for my FE and STL.

Steel is also essential for making Rfabs at PP3. I make STL every once and a while on my smelters for use at my PP3. For your PP1 I've found the best use in Antares for it is only making BDE - which is why I have mine on constant BDE production.

I planned to collect H in KI-401d before. After all, it is the planet with the highest yield nearby. But I have calculated the capacity that needs to be occupied. Basically, one of my ships must always serve this purpose, even if my H capacity is not mentioned as the highest.


[13-Aug-22 02:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
So where did you turn H into fuel? I always think that the closer you are to the origin of H, the better.


[13-Aug-22 02:13 AM] allocater#0000
you can make shipping contracts like Swift Mining Group


[13-Aug-22 02:16 AM] yuen8241#0000
Will anyone come to pick up this kind of list? I think the boat with only novices will be idle. If the Corp owns a big ship, why should it serve its competitors?


[13-Aug-22 04:46 AM] dersix#0000
already doing that, even steeling shippers from Swift Mining Group üôÇ

We have refineries on Phobos and Nike. Shipping is a hassle, but we have two big corp ships more or less dedicated to it


[13-Aug-22 06:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
I want to consult your opinion. I see that INS is sold very cheaply internally. I believe it is a welfare price, which is convenient for everyone to build on a special planet. On CX, is it appropriate for me to buy INS at the price of 225? I see that INS is very expensive in AI and CI areas.


[13-Aug-22 06:40 AM] allocater#0000
production cost of INS is like 75, 100 at most, so the market is a scam right now


[13-Aug-22 06:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that this is a kind of harvest by advanced players for new players who have not joined Corp. PP3 and the materials for producing INS are not available to new players.


[13-Aug-22 06:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
I thought about building a base on the planet with H before, and I saw that ANT's INS sold to 380 AIC.


[13-Aug-22 07:36 AM] dersix#0000
INS price has been stupidly high in the last weeks and most likely will stay also a bit there, availability of AR was a limiting factor (now it is more readily available but rather expensive)


[13-Aug-22 07:37 AM] dersix#0000
also the increase of shipping capacity is most likely feeding the INS consumption


[13-Aug-22 07:38 AM] dersix#0000
in AI, it's almost exclusively supplied by slomes on CX


[13-Aug-22 07:39 AM] dersix#0000
for the corp internal price, I'll keep it low for internal usage so that people can more easily colonize INS planets


[13-Aug-22 07:39 AM] dersix#0000
so if you have any plans of getting your feet on an INS planet, feel free to buy on NIKE, I try to always have 3-4k available


[13-Aug-22 07:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, the expensive INS price on cx can basically dispel my desire to build on a planet like QJ-382g.


[13-Aug-22 07:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
I plan to go to deimos for the third base and Hephaestus for the fourth base. Since we have enough fuel to use, but I don't have enough money to build a ship, I'll put INS planets' plan on hold.

ANT II b is high pressure = more ship dmg, heat shielding would reduce that dmg

Mine seems to almost always be an "A".

[24-Aug-22 03:38 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Also where is the best place to buy RAT these days? Harmonia still? It appears Demeter is having some issues keeping up with feeding its own bases?


[24-Aug-22 03:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
There's a lot of RAT production on Harmonia from other people I think, but I mostly make my RAT/FIM/MEA on Nike now. I think Demeter is fine on food production- there's a non OOG member who wants to buy cheap RATs there.


[24-Aug-22 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
(where do you use your FIM/MEA, btw?)


[24-Aug-22 03:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 200 RAT and 16 FIM on Harmonia, and 500 RAT, 8 FIM, 8 MEA @4000 on Nike.


[24-Aug-22 04:04 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I use them on Phobos for electronics buildings - RAT I need most on Nike because its my biggest base

Has anyone done a deep dive into the best RAT recipe?


[25-Aug-22 11:49 AM] allocater#0000
GRN BEA NUT


[25-Aug-22 11:52 AM] yang_mills#0000
+1


[25-Aug-22 01:12 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Why? Just curious what factor makes it best?


[25-Aug-22 01:31 PM] insensless72#0000
1 NUT recipe = 12
6 BEA recipe = 12
3 GRN recipe = 12 
They all take the same time to complete (1 day 9hrs for me) and it's relatively low on water, 10 H2O combined. Then 12 of each makes 120 RAT


[25-Aug-22 01:32 PM] domicius#0000
I use NUT/BEA/HCP, as I use HCP/GRN/MAI for fast C


[25-Aug-22 02:21 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Interesting.  When I produced them, I went with GRN/VEG/BEA since I thought I got them done a bit faster, but it did take more water.  As long as you don't need NS or something, it's not a huge difference.  The perfect sync on all that is nice


[25-Aug-22 02:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have done a deep dive on RAT production. Assuming you're getting water at 15/u, and pioneer supplies at cost, the labor + material costs of the potential foodstuffs are:

[25-Aug-22 02:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
So MAI edges out GRN on cost ever so slightly, although folks like GRN for C, so maybe it has more utility in being "swappable" as needed.


[25-Aug-22 02:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
I only use VEG for FOD.


[25-Aug-22 02:57 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Did you evaluate the profit over time or over area?  Those matter a lot more to me than input costs


[25-Aug-22 02:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
They all come from FRMs here so the area is the same for all of those.


[25-Aug-22 02:58 PM] allocater#0000
how did you calculate labor costs? I put 10 dummy labor costs per minute with water 15/u  and ~~MAI never was the cheapest~~ MAI is only cheapest with very little costs

[25-Aug-22 02:58 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Not totally true. If given inputs produce faster, you could need less farms for the same amount of output rats


[25-Aug-22 02:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000
but in this case it's almost certainly so small on area as to not matter; the profit over time is my #1 consideration though


[25-Aug-22 03:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
FRM costing 401.73 / 24 hours,  DW: 103.04    RAT: 147.58    OVE:23.32    POW: 21.06    COF:106.74. Admittedly those are very low costs, based on an iterative calculation of each of those production costs. I'm thinking of putting in overrides at corp costs, but haven't gotten around to it

[25-Aug-22 03:04 PM] allocater#0000
probably 0.27 AIC per minute


[25-Aug-22 03:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess I'd have to think about that, because this price per unit does account for a lower labor cost. I think you can just take the production cost and divide each FRM recipe by the farm's area to get what you're looking for. That being said, I do think there's actually a case to be made from MUS from HYF in RAT production.


[25-Aug-22 03:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
What's the X axis here?

[25-Aug-22 03:06 PM] allocater#0000
so there is indeed a window where MAI is cheapest


[25-Aug-22 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I haven't modeled building depreciation yet, which is a known issue for sure. But that can be considered an added labor cost.


[25-Aug-22 03:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Pretty sure building depreciation is a decent chunk of MEA price, but it's probably small for RATs.


[25-Aug-22 03:09 PM] allocater#0000
shows MAI window from 0.12 to 0.28

[25-Aug-22 03:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I only care about profit, so I take the profit of a chain and divide it by the area (incorporating the necessary habitation area) and I can get a profit per area "square."  It hasn't really mattered since I haven't been constrained by area yet, but that's how I figure that.


[25-Aug-22 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'm 80% sure those numbers are right (for my assumptions)


[25-Aug-22 03:37 PM] jackinabox86#0000
It looks cool to me; can't play around with an image


[25-Aug-22 03:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I'd bet that your grn, bea, veg recipe would be the most profitable


[25-Aug-22 03:38 PM] jackinabox86#0000
because you're getting the most units per day.  Even with a higher input cost, the excess production is likely enough to make it the most profitable


[25-Aug-22 03:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
This is a complicated mess, but you can duplicate it and mess with it. It also takes a super long time to calculate cause it has a lot of dependencies among fields and a lot of vlookups: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQio-Ou2znYif25GijFgRz9XSCVPSM8YGqcsMZu6EoQ/edit?usp=sharing

hm I think I have a mistake on the cost/u/day.


[25-Aug-22 03:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, the one thing my sheet doesn't handle is multiple output recipes, so HAL -> NA + CL messes up a lot of prices


[25-Aug-22 03:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you know the cost of the HAL, how do you split up the value into the NA and the CL? one might be super useful and the other a garbage by-product


[25-Aug-22 05:10 PM] jackinabox86#0000
This overall is an example of the problem I think about most, how to model all chains, short or long, against one another for profitability. Lots of good tools for specific recipes, but not as much for frm output with fp output for example


[25-Aug-22 05:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, here's another calculation that's interesting- maybe closer to what you were looking for. For each of the RAT products- assume you are making them into RATs that sell for 50/u, and attribute the value of the ration to each input. (thinking about the chain as a whole). Then the income / day of each farm (ignoring FP costs, since they are the same for each ration recipe), you get this:

[25-Aug-22 05:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
So if you are area constrained, HYF making mushrooms make more RAT inputs per unit area. But also HYFs cost like 300k AIC compared to farms under 1/10th of that.

I would have definitely put my HQ somewhere other than Antares owned space if I knew what I was doing sooner.


[27-Aug-22 11:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
ohh wait you don't need to rebuild it from scratch, the wiki says


[27-Aug-22 11:20 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You can move it once a month for free


[27-Aug-22 11:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
If you want to play with us, I‚Äôd make sure all of your early bases stay in the ANT core (Nike, Deimos, Harmonia, Phobos, Heph) then you can specialize as you have more bases. We can sell you cheaper prefabs and probably offer a loan in a few days. We all do better when you have an established operation @_bojidar


[27-Aug-22 11:22 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Shipping constraints hit fast and you don‚Äôt want to be too spread out and have to reconfigure once it hits. HQ upgrades are easy for us to help with ad well


[27-Aug-22 11:24 AM] _bojidar#0000
So it is just destroy HQ and rebuild it on other planet same lvl? Nothing else lose


[27-Aug-22 11:27 AM] insensless72#0000
You have several options. You can leave your initial base, plan out your 2nd base in the Antares system (how many fabs, consumables, constructions mats etc) and these will be provided to you from internal suppliers, along with a 200-300k starting investment package from the Bank to get you started. You could rip down as much as possible and bring to to Antares with you to use as a foundation for base 2. Or you could coliq and restart from scratch in Antares


[27-Aug-22 11:34 AM] _bojidar#0000
Well..as I said I.m ok to start a new planet and then eventually move HQ there if i dont lose all i have so far. And after...make more planets there and so on.. . but to destroy all just like that .. I don't like that..at least atm :)


[27-Aug-22 11:35 AM] allocater#0000
do you have a free permit to start a second base?

[28-Aug-22 08:17 AM] yuen8241#0000
Investing my assets in low-income industries leads me to have to rely on market transactions to subsidize my finances.


[28-Aug-22 08:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
According to pruner's calculation, my bases now only produce 70k profit a day.


[28-Aug-22 08:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
If there is a well-developed consumable planet, a single base can be 50k a day, not to mention industries such as drones.


[28-Aug-22 08:33 AM] allocater#0000
70k per day is pretty good, my farm base is 10k per day for months

Happy trading!


[28-Aug-22 11:33 AM] _bojidar#0000
from build ship  channel...the point is that since there are no limits for ships..and people can make there own unlimited fleet it kinda make pointless getting new people in..since all can do everything by them selfs and ship it all by them self..and  it is even worse  globally for this game ... if there are new players..who will even buy there production or need them to ship for the rich...since most people are self producing and shipping everything..so new players will be even less attracted to play here...and basically if any game dont attract and keep new players..it is just matter of time to go down.. well will be interested to see other thoughts üôÇ


[28-Aug-22 11:35 AM] dersix#0000
new players have a lot of opportunities, yes shipping is getting less and less a constrain but still permits are limiting


[28-Aug-22 11:36 AM] dersix#0000
I for example only do one type of consumable and that's FIM (as the market is not offering enough for my need), everything else I buy from corp or CX


[28-Aug-22 11:36 AM] dersix#0000
and I know a lot of older players do it the same (as consumables are a really great way of getting involved)


[28-Aug-22 11:39 AM] _bojidar#0000
may be i got it wrong but i think i have read somewhere there isnt any limits for HQ upgrades if PRO ..beside its getting more and more expensive..

No problem, i usually try to add some stuff if i have it available when the notification comes up


[28-Aug-22 01:09 PM] dersix#0000
the upgrade 21->22 is getting crazy expensive (and the afabs are not even available in numbers on CX normally)


[28-Aug-22 01:10 PM] dersix#0000
but a lot of people stop before, getting up to 14 is relatively cheap


[28-Aug-22 01:10 PM] _bojidar#0000

[28-Aug-22 01:12 PM] balbar#0000
pretty sure i'll stick to way fewer than 15. sounds like work at that pointüòÉ


[28-Aug-22 01:13 PM] dersix#0000
if you spend some STO for your bases and using shipping contracts, it's actually not that bad


[28-Aug-22 01:14 PM] balbar#0000
true, "worst" part is keeping everything supplied with 2 ships


[28-Aug-22 01:16 PM] _bojidar#0000
ships should be more expensive for each after like bases imo


[28-Aug-22 01:23 PM] jackinabox86#0000
No one is ‚Äúforced‚Äù to use two ships. Devs have to eat, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unfair that they have a point at which players need to contribute.


[28-Aug-22 01:24 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Also, additional ships just generate more economic activity that needs to be fulfilled. Sure shipping contracts will be reduced, but the new bases will need lots of consumables. No one can vertically integrate everything.

[30-Aug-22 08:34 PM] churavis#0000
Enough to cause people to panic buy DW?

Input scarcity spikes usually happen more gradually as people slowly exhaust their stocks


[30-Aug-22 08:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
FP is very easy to substitute DW and Water. It looks like the water price started rising before the FW price went up. But neither had unusual volumes that accompany someone playing market games.. also not really an indication of panic buying in either volume listing


[30-Aug-22 08:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
I wonder if a regular producer left.


[30-Aug-22 09:20 PM] allocater#0000
I hope it wasn't me by making a detour with the water tanker to get H. I can still feed a bit DW at 60 until the next delivery, but I can't fill the DW market volume on my own


[30-Aug-22 09:21 PM] churavis#0000
Your DW order stopped it from going even higher

Also, why would you undercut yourself?


[30-Aug-22 09:29 PM] allocater#0000
to still provide reasonable prices for buyers of low volumes, but high volume buyers have to pay 99 now. This should cause some demand constraints until the drought is resolved


[31-Aug-22 02:15 AM] yang_mills#0000
I did. Bought 3K DW on CX. Because the upkeep on Phobos won't fill itself. There is a lot of DW needed.

Can I use the spreadsheet template we have for corp producers for the other corp I trade with? Obviously with all the names and productions and everything removed, just the outline. Would save some time because I don‚Äôt know how to really make/use sheets.

Real answer: you can always make your own personal copy of a spreadsheet and rename that copy and mess with it however you'd like


[01-Sep-22 11:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
That production page is really just a list of names, products, and colored cells, there's not really any logic in there to copy

the point is it to worth it to change any other production for it


[01-Sep-22 12:52 PM] churavis#0000
AEF is expensive as NE is hard to source and takes a lot of PP2 time, meaning it would be a while before you get a return on your investment if then as repairs will be AEF as well


[01-Sep-22 12:54 PM] _bojidar#0000
at what point or % should be repared buildings?

Not sure what others do but I like to keep mine above 85%


[01-Sep-22 01:07 PM] churavis#0000
The most effective times are as close to 30, 60, or 90 days as possible. After 90 days there is a much steeper drop off in efficiency.


[01-Sep-22 04:28 PM] erklein#0000
Specifically at the at or above the low 77% which is generally around the 90 day point. It‚Äôs at that point that buildings with an even number of fabs change to needing another

Now that dw is increasing in price and cof is decreasing in price, are they using too much dw to make cof?

Might just be less DW on the market

Obviously, I want to win for personal reasons (I've won or placed in two other haiku contests already) but I really do want to put the FTL Heavy in service to OOG. So  what say you?

[05-Sep-22 06:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's pretty low population though

I would assume we want it to remain confusing like our other planet names, so we should probably name it Demidas

you can convert currency on the currency market, usually 10% loss, or send 2 currency swap contracts to me (1:1)

It's not easy to make a profit to ship goods from hortus to ant these days.


[07-Sep-22 03:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
I guess it may be that the player's transportation ability has improved after the version update.


[07-Sep-22 04:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that as time goes by, it will be more and more difficult for new players to get the first pot of gold by cx.


[07-Sep-22 09:56 PM] erklein#0000
So I've looked into how you calculate population needs, but how do you calculate the happiness based off the fulfilled needs? Is it using the same numbers but applied as a ratio for each population group?

You might be interested into 2 of our current expansion programs, Nascent to convert crops to Carbon and Yk-649b to turn crops into RAT/etc.


[08-Sep-22 11:22 AM] _bojidar#0000
i.m up for C as we discussed earlier, but is there enough crops for it, or it is needed to produce crops as well?


[08-Sep-22 11:22 AM] allocater#0000
yeah crops are needed as well, with bases on harmonia and demeter


[08-Sep-22 11:23 AM] _bojidar#0000

With the high spike of water cost on the ANT CX I was looking at maybe making an H2O RIG base on FK-794b - Boucher as my second base once I've saved up enough to do so.

Would that be of any use to you over there or would that be too far away? (It'll be a few weeks to a month maybe before I've saved up enough to start it up so the idea's not set in stone ^^ )

the complicated part about POPI is that the results of changes in supply is not fully applied


[08-Sep-22 03:55 PM] dersix#0000
the happiness depends also on the value of the 4 reports before (in a weighted manner)


[08-Sep-22 03:55 PM] dersix#0000
only programs have an instant and full effect all the time


[08-Sep-22 03:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Where can you find the cost of programs?


[08-Sep-22 04:00 PM] dersix#0000
on the rules page


[08-Sep-22 04:00 PM] dersix#0000
LR LS-300c


[08-Sep-22 04:00 PM] dersix#0000
for example for griff


[08-Sep-22 04:01 PM] dersix#0000
the cost of the program is different from planet to planet


[08-Sep-22 04:01 PM] dersix#0000
I think it's depending on the amount of pop


[08-Sep-22 04:02 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I don't see a cost on that page, just a list of the current, upcoming, and past programs


[08-Sep-22 04:02 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm trying to make sure the joker on Heph gets me some engineers, so was trying to figure out the best way to help him


[08-Sep-22 04:02 PM] jackinabox86#0000
he's going to run an engineer program once, but I was trying to figure out if I should pay for another one or figure out some other upkeep to donate


[08-Sep-22 04:03 PM] dersix#0000
you only see the cost as gov


[08-Sep-22 04:03 PM] jackinabox86#0000
is it in currency or goods?


[08-Sep-22 04:03 PM] dersix#0000
currency


[08-Sep-22 04:04 PM] dersix#0000
I can't check right now as I've a program queued


[08-Sep-22 04:04 PM] jackinabox86#0000
no worries; helpful answer


[08-Sep-22 04:04 PM] dersix#0000
but it might be that the immigration ones are fixed cost


[08-Sep-22 04:06 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I looked at DeimosBob's accounting spreadsheet and he shows currency.  His last program was 100k.  That's not that big a deal

Montanox has been removed since 2 days have gone by with no communication as a recruit


[11-Sep-22 10:29 AM] insensless72#0000
I potentially could, how many are you looking for?


[11-Sep-22 10:33 AM] _bojidar#0000
i try to calculate what would be needed if i start a base on a planet where i need 1xTSH for every building..how much would it costs? as if its kinda ok probably some 15-20 probably for a while


[11-Sep-22 10:35 AM] insensless72#0000
I would redo your math, its usually 1per unit of area. For example on Nike you need 10 SEA to build 1 HB1 since it takes up 10 units


[11-Sep-22 10:35 AM] _bojidar#0000
no..on this planet is 1 per building


[11-Sep-22 10:35 AM] insensless72#0000

I have 20 THP on Heph, when I get them to Nike I can begin TSH, ill have enough to make 10 TSH


[11-Sep-22 10:37 AM] _bojidar#0000
ok,,nice for a start..but how much would it cost..it seems like hightech items


[11-Sep-22 10:37 AM] insensless72#0000
Its never been requested, 1 sec let me do some maths


[11-Sep-22 10:37 AM] _bojidar#0000
ok ty


[11-Sep-22 10:39 AM] insensless72#0000
it would be around 5k each


[11-Sep-22 10:39 AM] _bojidar#0000
its cool then.


[11-Sep-22 10:41 AM] _bojidar#0000
i.ll start collecting them till i have enough. may you start with these 10 now and later(not urgent if have more important) make 20 more?


[11-Sep-22 10:41 AM] insensless72#0000
You got it üëç \


[11-Sep-22 11:05 AM] _bojidar#0000
btw how long you think it will take for these 30?


[11-Sep-22 11:05 AM] _bojidar#0000
or first 10 at least


[11-Sep-22 11:06 AM] insensless72#0000
tbh a while. I have a lot of shifting to do of goods. lets say 5 days to a week


[11-Sep-22 11:06 AM] _bojidar#0000

ok.i need 700 then


[11-Sep-22 11:16 AM] _bojidar#0000
I need some FF as well..some 400 if possible


[11-Sep-22 11:16 AM] churavis#0000
Send a contract for the LST


[11-Sep-22 11:17 AM] churavis#0000
Put up the ad for the FF and post it on the Nike Fuel-ops channel


[11-Sep-22 11:18 AM] _bojidar#0000
let me see how much i can hold in WH but..may be 700 is bit much


[11-Sep-22 11:18 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I'm online now, so if you post for the FF you need now, I can fill. Corp rate is 8/u for both SF and FF

I wouldn‚Äôt invest more in fuel ATM. We have so much it is ridiculous


[11-Sep-22 11:26 AM] _bojidar#0000
yea..not too much into it..already looking to expand on else


[11-Sep-22 11:27 AM] jackinabox86#0000
And don‚Äôt forget you have to spend one TSH per repair as well. So that‚Äôs one more per building every 90 ish days


[11-Sep-22 11:27 AM] jackinabox86#0000
If you need GAL, I have loads


[11-Sep-22 11:28 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I recently built a HE3 base on Avalon so hopefully I'll start bringing surplus HE3 back to Nike soon. Then I can sell to either of you from there


[11-Sep-22 11:28 AM] _bojidar#0000
they are not really in production..or its ok..but no1 produce it

beside Etherwind around here ..is there any other good planet for H2O?


[11-Sep-22 11:35 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You can do c solo on Harmonia and then just expand to more planets later


[11-Sep-22 11:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I‚Äôd do something cheap like that before something expensive that needs TSH


[11-Sep-22 11:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
But whatever you want to do is cool. We can probably make the TSH when needed


[11-Sep-22 11:36 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yeah, fuel prices have come down quite a bit so its not nearly as profitable as it was - especially if you're in Benton where the inputs are much more accessible. Here in Antares the price soared to over 16/u for quite a while, I was making around 200 per hour profit on any fuel I could bring to market! But I think the efforts of @jackinabox86 and I were able to stabilize it so now its meh lol

[14-Sep-22 04:34 AM] allocater#0000
only new players can start on the planet. Anyone else has to wait for a free spot


[14-Sep-22 09:46 AM] jackinabox86#0000
As people leave the game, the number of ghost plots decreases.  If it ever gets below zero, there will be an open plot you can snag.  It's relatively rare and they get snapped up very quickly, so you want to have a base kit prepositioned and make sure you check frequently.


[14-Sep-22 12:15 PM] dersix#0000
briefly after the steam rush I've done daily statistics on the evolution of the ghost plots on Phobos in order to not miss my spot üôÇ


[15-Sep-22 09:44 AM] yjhasaday#0000
If you can't get on Phobos there are plenty of plots available on Nike! Corp HQ efficiency bonus is nice plus there are so many corp Prefab Plants making bfabs that its the easiest expansion you will ever have lol.

I enjoyed the sheer terror of paying back my 200K loan within 20 days. Was a lot more fun than watching the AIC counter tick up another million every couple weeks.

what is defference between H2O and H2O mineral?


[17-Sep-22 03:45 AM] allocater#0000
H2O liquid is extracted with RIG
H2O mineral is extracted with EXT
there is also H2O gas that is extracted with COL


[17-Sep-22 03:48 AM] _bojidar#0000
i see. ty


[17-Sep-22 06:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Extraction via RIGs is quite a bit more efficient than the alternatives

Nice job!


[20-Sep-22 07:40 AM] zipatsu#0000
My ship will arrive on Etherwind around this time tomorrow,  I should have all the materials on me to start my second base there right away but since this will be my first base expansion I was wondering if there's anything special I need to do for it beyond having the mats and hitting Start Base?


[20-Sep-22 07:43 AM] balbar#0000
don't forget raw materials and consumables?


[20-Sep-22 07:45 AM] balbar#0000
which you should keep on your ship until you set up the base. No need for them to eat until you are ready to produce..not sure how much of an influence that really has though


[20-Sep-22 07:45 AM] zipatsu#0000
I should have enough for 15~20 days or so if I prepared correctly

As long as Etherwind is a MCG planet? My first expansion was to Nike where SEA is required to build and I didn't bring any lol üòÖ but as long as the planet is rocky and temp/pressure/gravity are good then you don't need any additional materials to build


[20-Sep-22 08:20 AM] balbar#0000
I think that was the main pro point for Etherwind instead of ice station alpha. No HSE and INS required


[20-Sep-22 08:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
Etherwind, you don't have to think about population and infrastructure.


[20-Sep-22 08:21 AM] balbar#0000
well, if you only go for H2O, no issues with that on ISA either, CoGC is pretty cheap to as there are onbly a few people

@everyone Dear OOG members. I will soon stop playing the game. My PRO subscription runs out in 3 days, and my gov term on Phobos ends in 10 days. I will stop after that. I fill like I start losing interest for the game and need a pause. I won't COLIQ, I won't dismantle my bases and I won't liquidate my stocks, so a can return at a later point. I will just leave my production lines in disrepair and my workers go on strike. It's not a big deal. I will also leave OOG in game. There is no point in me receiving the dividends. I really enjoyed being part of OOG and I believe that our corp has achieved a lot. I hope it will continue to prosper. I might return to PrUn at some later point, in particular if the devs decide to bring us a serious expansion. Have fun, and perhaps see you later.

@everyone OOG members, it is with a heavy heart that I announce my retirement from Prosperous Universe. Note that this was not an easy decision for me to make. Alas, real life reigns supreme. Over these last 2 years, you guys have made this game, and building this corp, one of the most fun experiences I have had gaming in a very long time and for that I thank you. I will hand over the rights to the Discord to @allocater and leave OOG in all of your very capable hands to grow and manage as you see fit. There are several tasks that need to be completed before I leave, but I will list those in a different channel. I thank you all for the fun times and wish you safe travels wherever life may lead you.

Hey folks, it might be a bit of a bad timing but I also have to resign from the game. From next month on my time will reduce drastically and that will no longer allow me to maintain a good running account. I'm going to give away my stuff either tomorrow or on sunday. I'll continue feeding Griff until my term is over, so there will be no negative publicity coming from that. If no one wants to take over Griff, I'm going to inform the locals so that they can find someone to follow. In case you already need some of the stuff that I'm producing, just drop me a message, I'll give it away for 1 AIC. If someone needs an economical push for building up some industries to support OOG just let me know, otherwise I'll put the cash in the bank.

Dehzhas of "Garson Kilman Industries" [GK42] is a new player with only 20days. But he sold me on a really nice pre-purchase of DW. 500 units a week for 5 weeks.

Excellent questions. I think you can add your planets right away if you want. The in-game invite comes at the end of the trial, just remind us when that's up and I can send you an investment package at that time. And you can take advantage of the corp pricing now as well. (if any of that's wrong, please let me know, I _think_ that's how we've been doing it.)

@dehzhas Oh you were the one setting up those long-term RAT / DW contracts in the UFO discord. I thought that was really good gameplay to promote those, and useful to the player community. Glad you are joining our corporation. Hope it works out.

I now hold the record for most expensive PWO ever sold on AI1 CX as the price is spiking.
Also, I still have extra on Heph and Ant so if anyone needs some then send me a contract and don't buy it at my nose gouging price.

Anyone want to buy some TI? 1000/u on ANT. I'm going to list it for higher on the CX. I've been trying to snipe the lowball offers from @allocater, but some other rando got smart and put in a slightly better, but still terrible offer.

I've got 129 available


[07-Oct-22 09:24 PM] yuen8241#0000

I'm working on selling Bobemar the entire DW supply for Deimos. He has been sick so hasn't closed the deal on the rest of it, but I suspect he will close it. Once he has the entire DW supply delivered at 50/u weekly, he may be more open to contributing to other things.

He had 7 WPLs on Heph, presumably to make KV. and enough LAB/POL/CHP for the EPO, TCL, etc... so yeah maybe he was really making that many rfabs all the time

he had quite the money...


[13-Oct-22 03:24 PM] churavis#0000
Well I guess if he had 20 then I can probably build more than 2. I don't know how much I'll have to change to supply them though.


[13-Oct-22 04:35 PM] jackinabox86#0000
he had a guaranteed buyer for his Rfabs


[13-Oct-22 04:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
you might want to ask him who that was if you make a ton; I think there's a ton of pent up in-corp demand


[13-Oct-22 04:36 PM] jackinabox86#0000
but ultimately, we will only use so many


[13-Oct-22 04:41 PM] churavis#0000
There's plenty of demand on the CX alone so I don't think he'd need much more than the corp and CX

When his rfabs raw materials are insufficient, he can turn to INS production.

I was originally excited to get some SE going, but having a handful now I don‚Äôt feel like the payoff is all that high. We dump a shit ton of rfabs into them with a long payback period. But that might just be because over time you get complacent about bigger numbers. I‚Äôm sure in a couple months I‚Äôll be over my newer investments as well


[14-Oct-22 08:28 AM] churavis#0000

He's still planning a base, it'll be a few weeks before it's ready though.


[14-Oct-22 07:01 PM] churavis#0000
And even once he has the base he's obviously going to prioritize his own needs

Welcome @optitronic  and @legosfreak ! I'd encourage you to enter your bases and prices on the two sheets on this google doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ElN228qfp6zBqv6srr_sXLwlicnvUcvJqCcA8dPWH-s/edit#gid=0  That helps us know what you're focusing on so we can help out- either buying your stuff or helping you with your supply of consumables and ingredients.

If all goes well, I can buy 10,000 SF at the price of 7.32CIS.


[20-Oct-22 08:39 AM] jackinabox86#0000
Is that worth a shipping run when you can buy it from us for 8 AIC?


[20-Oct-22 09:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
I use it too much, so that I may buy up the stock of yj14. Besides, the cargo hold was empty when I came back from benten.

Yang and pokter are both H producers. I don't know if yj14 can support the original demand now.

Hi @everyone, we have a threat to take our HQ planet, Nike! I am asking those on Nike to vote, which I've already done in the Nike channel, but here I am asking anyone who ISN'T on Nike if they want a base there? I am willing to personally finance bases for votes - this may not be legal in the real world but in PrUn... anything goes. *taps fingers together like Mr. Burns*

Please let me know if you currently aren't on Nike but would like to be and I can give you a payment to join/the bfabs and basic base building materials. Don't let OOG homeworld fall!

everyone should have a base on Nike given the 10% corp production bonus.  If nothing else, help extract LST

I'll put up the ads gonna help with LST at least

[21-Oct-22 10:48 AM] churavis#0000
The corp uses a lot of LST and the CX can soak up quite a bit too.

I have 122 SEA (on Nike) to offer new Nike bases
and there are 1000s of SEA on the ANT CX which is not always the case
and the CX price is at the 7-day average of 120/u


[21-Oct-22 11:32 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
I have a free permit I can use for that but I'll have to abandon the base afterwards and use the permit somewhere else in the near future.


[21-Oct-22 11:34 AM] churavis#0000
You can get the entire core module mats back no matter how long its there


[21-Oct-22 11:34 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
Then maybe if someone could trade the mats I can make a base, then when I'm gone I'll send them back to that person?

To whom should I reach out for the mats? Can also pay for them if needed. Dont have any ships near CX's to buy them though at least for half a week.


[21-Oct-22 12:16 PM] allocater#0000
PSL has to come from outside, L-fabs probably from @yjhasadayTRU and mcg from anyone, if you create the ads we will see what remains unfulfilled


[21-Oct-22 12:33 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, just create ads on the Nike LM and I will fill what I can, I have Bfabs, some Lfabs, bringing in more PSL, lots of MCG, and a little SEA. But I do not have TRU so we may need someone else to cover that. Maybe bring it in from Deimos?


[21-Oct-22 12:43 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
Posted them now ^


[21-Oct-22 12:47 PM] yjhasaday#0000
For more clarity I will cover the Core Module as well as a HB1, EXT, and one building of your choice for free. I'm thinking the best way to do this is for you all to post buy ads on the LM for the usual corp price on these things, and send me a contract selling 1 RAT/DW for the total bill. I do not have all the materials to cover everyone so we will need some other corp members to fill some orders - this method will allow them to get paid for their contributions as well

[21-Oct-22 12:48 PM] yjhasaday#0000

[21-Oct-22 12:58 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Excellent, thank you! What is your price per unit of TRU? I'm calculating a flat number for base payouts


[21-Oct-22 12:59 PM] jackinabox86#0000
150


[21-Oct-22 01:04 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
This is what I used for prices, if it helps anyone - based on the spreadsheet above: 

TRU - 8 for 1200 - 150ea
MCG - 100 for 1500 - 15ea 
SEA - 25 for 2975 - 119ea (didn't find any in the spreadsheet so took the market price) 
LSE - 4 for 15600 - 3900ea
PSL - 12 for 19200 - 1600ea
LDE - 4 for 14000 - 3500ea
LTA - 4 for 5200 - 1300ea
Total: 59 675


[21-Oct-22 01:05 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
Side question - if I vote, then demolish the base to get the materials back for the core module, does the vote still remain? Could trade mats to someone else afterwards.


[21-Oct-22 01:08 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think you did it all right, but the MCG is 15ea, to prevent confusion

Prayge 

[21-Oct-22 01:08 PM] yjhasaday#0000
So I have expanded on your post above, my offer also includes a HB1, EXT, and I've decided to include a PP2. So the total comes to 106K, but I will bump it up to 115K for some money to cover consumables to get started. So anyone who is interested in a Nike base send me a contract requesting 115K AIC and then post your buys for the following:


[21-Oct-22 01:09 PM] churavis#0000
I've got SEA for 80/u


[21-Oct-22 01:10 PM] yjhasaday#0000
okay, will fix, but the number can remain at 115K

just like playing board games... if there is a mechanism for taking out loans, then you should seriously consider doing it üôÇ
it feels nice being able to boot-strap yourself in this game, but most buildings will pay for themselves very quickly.. the money shouldn't be a limiting factor for your expansion efforts, early in the game
I was reluctant to take a loans from allocator, but it really shortened the time to reach a consistent profitability


[24-Oct-22 11:03 AM] jackinabox86#0000
It also helps you get to a scale where you can enjoy the game

I knew I would love this game, but it took getting to 4 bases before I could feel like I was pushing enough buttons to have fun during a particular session


[24-Oct-22 11:05 AM] churavis#0000
I dunno, the most fun I had in this game was when I was so strapped for cash that I had to build a complex spreadsheet to calculate the most profitable products

can somebody sell me 1k H on KI-401d?


[24-Oct-22 02:51 PM] yjhasaday#0000
This time is a bit different, I'm shamelessly buying votes so we don't lose our home planet! This isn't a loan, its a bribe üòÜ  So you don't need to pay it back. Also FYI to @_bojidar  and anyone else interested. 

How it works: Just send me a contract or post on the LM 1 DW/RAT for sale for 115,000 AIC and I will fill it. You can then use the money to create your Nike base - The money was calculated to cover the following materials - which should be enough for you to build a Core Module, HB1, EXT, and a PP2.  @allocater if you have already handed out any money then let me know and I'll pay it back to you!


You can post for the materials at the prices in the chart on the Nike LM, members from the corp will fill what we can! As soon as your base is up and running be sure to toss me a vote in the Nike election üôÇ

yeah. lol. guess I should have read all the new content first  haha


[24-Oct-22 03:30 PM] seraphx2#0000
but as yuen said, don't we just need the CM? do we need to actually have production going?


[24-Oct-22 03:30 PM] seraphx2#0000
115k seems a higher burden than necessary if it's just the CM that's needed


[24-Oct-22 03:31 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Lol, no the production buildings are a gift - we are in need of more LST extraction and Bfab production so I'm happy to lend some extra funds to those new to Nike as long as they are helping fill a corp need üôÇ


[24-Oct-22 03:31 PM] seraphx2#0000
ahhh  gotcha


[24-Oct-22 03:32 PM] seraphx2#0000
well, if it's LST that you need as well, might as well take you up on it....lol


[24-Oct-22 03:32 PM] yjhasaday#0000
That being said, you don't need to build them! Do as you please (but they are probably the best starter buildings for a Nike base)


[24-Oct-22 03:35 PM] churavis#0000
It's pretty easy to sell LST on the LM for CX prices

I was going to sell them on the market, but I wanted to check if anyone could use a boost to their productivity


[25-Oct-22 10:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
I usually buy a bunch of ALE from HRT. ALE is mainly used by technicians (ASM and LAB)


[25-Oct-22 10:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now ALE has a good price in ANT, so I suggest you sell it directly.

The production of FLX is too fast, and the FLX produced in one day is enough for a long time, so the supply is not stable enough.

[28-Oct-22 06:21 AM] gladeowl#0000
Oh, neat. I'll have to check with Exeler though, as the current base only provides around half of what he wants. So need to reserve some area for that expansion. How much ALO were you thinking of?

If you want. I can send you a bunch of contracts totalling to around 160k (5 contracts for 500 ALO for 64/u), if you pay in advance I'll use that to fund the expansion and then just fill them up one by one.

Yep, we have a corp spreadsheet where we fill out our bases and what products we sell.

Benten's CX price fluctuates seriously.


[31-Oct-22 08:27 PM] exeler#0000
Woah, you can buy a whole CX in Benten? They must have some wild construction capacity for that.


[31-Oct-22 08:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
Benten's price is sometimes very different In a day or two., and I can't understand the transaction price, so it is suitable for people with energy to make money with it. If I have more liquidity, I will put a lot of purchase orders there.


[31-Oct-22 08:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
The price difference between Benten and ANT sometimes causes the profit to reach 30% or even more.


[31-Oct-22 08:37 PM] yuen8241#0000
Now, the price of HRT is relatively stable, and it is suitable for bulk trading.


[31-Oct-22 08:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
Generally speaking, it is suitable to buy DW, RAT, COF ÔºåALE, FIM, GIN and OVE in HRT.

Stupid Question. What happens if you bought stuff on the CX, it got filled but you didn't have an inventory there. Ships or Warehouses.
A friend of mine is in this pickle right now and we can't really find where the stuff could be.

Do you make your own EPO or PG? Thats been the bottleneck for Rfabs recently.

[07-Nov-22 01:29 PM] churavis#0000
No, there's no rule, it's just kind of suspicious and makes it seem like some large corporation is trying to rig the vote by getting all its members to go for just one planet...

I mean, we could do it better. Imagine if we all coordinated to be the scalper.


[07-Nov-22 01:51 PM] exeler#0000
Also picking DW for that kind of move is basically suicide.


[07-Nov-22 01:52 PM] churavis#0000
You couldn't get away with it for long, after a day or two smelters and traders would bring in more until you run out of warehouse space.


[07-Nov-22 01:53 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Taxes. There weren't many CUO planets in the last universe. So we picked a planet each and created a base, if there wasn't and ADM we built one, the rest corp plants bases on the CUO planets at the same time and votes for one of their own. The winner then raises taxes on everything so it becomes unprofitable to mine CUO for anyone outside the corp.


[07-Nov-22 01:56 PM] exeler#0000
That's amazing. 

I'd love for this game to have more ways to do things like this. Imagine if access to planet infrastructure (and therefore workers) depended on something like faction standing and how much influence a faction had on the planet. 

Take over a planet and restrict foreign faction's ability to do business there.


[07-Nov-22 01:57 PM] churavis#0000
Only if you want to make it really difficult for anyone in this corp to win any future elections on any planet


[07-Nov-22 01:57 PM] archielvahr#0000

[07-Nov-22 01:58 PM] churavis#0000
I feel like some corp tried that before?


[07-Nov-22 02:00 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Only a few players reacted really badly, it was mostly viewed as a funny inconvenience. The high taxes only lasted a week or two and commerce has a short memory so there were no real lasting impacts.


[08-Nov-22 03:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
We can frantically sell AUO to cx at mm price, but it needs a lot of capacity.


[08-Nov-22 02:05 PM] exeler#0000
I think selling aggressively into the CX would be good for basically everyone though. If someone did that for a good I needed, I'd probably just stop making it myself and buy it all since it's at the cheapest it can possibly be.


[08-Nov-22 08:15 PM] legosfreak#0000
I'm still a semi new player to this game so I have a question. On the population overview for the base there is the required workforce, then there is the current workforce. What is the Parenthesis next to the current work force? I have 980 current workforce with 380 in parenthesis.


[08-Nov-22 08:16 PM] churavis#0000
Just to be clear, non-semi new players are allowed to ask questions too


[08-Nov-22 08:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think non-new players can also ask questions.


[08-Nov-22 08:18 PM] churavis#0000
The number in parenthesis are the workers that you are currently pulling from the workforce reserve pool, or the workers available before the next POPR. You can only pull so many of them, depending on the size of the population and the local rules


[08-Nov-22 08:18 PM] legosfreak#0000
Ahh ok that makes sense. Just expanded and that would be why


[08-Nov-22 08:18 PM] churavis#0000
Is there an echo in here?

What are the rules/requirements for inviting somebody?


[09-Nov-22 01:52 PM] jackinabox86#0000
talk to @yjhasaday, he runs recruitment.  Requirements are pretty light, particularly if you know the person.  Generally speaking they get invited to the discord for a week trial and then as long as they aren't unbelievably corrupt or obtuse, they get invited in game and get the meager dividend.


[09-Nov-22 01:52 PM] churavis#0000
Probably lighter than they should be


[09-Nov-22 05:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have had a lot of work with school recently, and I didn't really have much to give to you guys because of the lack of time and dedication I've had for PrUn in the past few months. I didn't really have any massive responsibilities for the corp specifically aside from 2 UPF, which I think can be easily replaced. Thanks everyone for giving me something to do during the summer. Not sure if I'm to leave this server or not, but that's all. I didn't really have much to give back either, resources down, consumables out, again because of school and other things going on. 

Good luck with all of your companies!

Yeah, as @jackinabox86 laid out we're pretty chill about new recruits. Really the main thing we care about is that they are active, and if they quit the game, they leave OOG first - we can't kick them out until their company liquidates. 

Why don't you give me your friend's company info and I can reach out and start a chat with them?

Honestly the same person buys pretty large amounts regularly from me. This was just the most I'd ever listed at once.


[12-Nov-22 03:24 AM] domicius#0000
Yes, it's SW. I need large amounts of MEA too - more soon too if I expand my SW to meet @allocater  demand!


[12-Nov-22 07:47 AM] domicius#0000
Pro-tip: if you want a set of contracts grouped together in the contract drafts window for convenience, and the aren't right now, just copy all the relevant contracts and delete the originals.  This way they'll all be together.


[12-Nov-22 07:47 AM] domicius#0000
Pro-tip2: put the user's name in the contract title to make it easier to fill in later.


[12-Nov-22 07:49 AM] domicius#0000
Pro-tip3: when sending contracts for large quantities, split it into several smaller contracts and just press send a few extra times. This will make the whole thing easier to handle.


[12-Nov-22 07:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
I really hope Allocater will do this, so that I don't have to submit a large number of goods at once.


[12-Nov-22 07:53 AM] allocater#0000
üòÖ  you mean you don't like my contracts for 5 cargo bays at once? üòÑ


[12-Nov-22 07:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
Yes, because I usually don't stock so many goods and raw materials. If you inform me in advance, I wouldn't be in such a hurry.ü§£


[12-Nov-22 07:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
Your MSL should be produced on schedule, but my ZR is not enough for MFL, and Balbar is still producing it.


[12-Nov-22 07:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, in the future, this situation can be alleviated with the increase of my funds, and I can reserve more raw materials in advance.


[12-Nov-22 08:43 AM] allocater#0000
Is's ok, it's the demand for every 2 weeks. SKF still has the most idle time.


[12-Nov-22 10:04 AM] churavis#0000
How much for a WCB and MFL then?


[12-Nov-22 12:10 PM] allocater#0000
300k and 150k

It's cheap to buy MG from benten, so there's no need to make it yourself.


[15-Nov-22 03:44 AM] rune_242#0000
or you could buy from @archielvahr


[15-Nov-22 06:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, check the CX for quantities available of MG and MGS, and send a contract at the corp price. (MGS @ 100, MG @ 60)


[15-Nov-22 07:10 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
Hi all; I run Lambda Industries off of Harmonia which is so far spec'd into Carbon, PE, and very light BDE production...also forgot to introduce myself yesterday lol


[15-Nov-22 07:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
Welcome! Please check the rules and fill out the form. We are glad to have new members join us. If you have financing needs or wish to get sponsorship, please pay attention to OOG Bank Channel and Base Sponsorship Channel.


[15-Nov-22 07:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
Since you can already produce BDE and PE, I guess you have bases in nike and Heph.


[15-Nov-22 07:27 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
Actually my only base is Harmonia at the moment. Still kind of new to PU


[15-Nov-22 07:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
Then I suggest you expand to other planets. BMP and PP1 can be built in Heph and Nike, respectively. That's how I expanded before. PE and bde sell well.


[15-Nov-22 07:31 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
Im currently working with Exeler to expand a Hydrogen base at the moment as my first new base.


[15-Nov-22 07:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
Generally, I don't recommend new players to build base H, except in cx's galaxy. Transportation is a big problem, and the upfront investment is also big. To tell the truth, most of the BMP formulas of Heph are very profitable now, but it takes a lot of energy to pay attention to the market, which is very suitable for you.


[15-Nov-22 07:42 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
The base is completely funded by Exeler through advanced contract payments and the daily upkeep of the base is low enough to have it running without issues for a while.


[15-Nov-22 07:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you don't have VBC, the produced H will not be shipped out unless you build an H base in the planetary system of cx.


[15-Nov-22 07:48 AM] gladeowl#0000
VBC?


[15-Nov-22 07:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
1000t/3000m¬≥ cargo  ship


[15-Nov-22 07:48 AM] gladeowl#0000
ohhh


[15-Nov-22 07:51 AM] sir_deplorable#0000
The shipments are 800 H for every 8 days. But I can do 500 H per trip instead.

[15-Nov-22 07:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you choose to build in cx, and reduce the capacity consumption, your income will be reduced.


[15-Nov-22 07:59 AM] yuen8241#0000
The good news is that cx's H base can be maintained only by one STL boat. For those who don't like to rely on cx for trading, around 500 H is enough for several people.


[15-Nov-22 08:01 AM] gladeowl#0000
Oh. You can upgrade an existing ship, right? How much is it for the VBC upgrade?


[15-Nov-22 08:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
VBC is not suitable for upgrading, because the cost of upgrading is close to buying a new one. VBC is about more than 3.5 million AIC.


[15-Nov-22 08:04 AM] gladeowl#0000
Oh boy.


[15-Nov-22 08:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
Rune plans to build an H base. He booked a VBC, but to be honest, this is not suitable for newcomers. After calculating the ship, the investment is high and the output is low. This is to improve the industrial chain and serve Corp.


[15-Nov-22 08:05 AM] gladeowl#0000

Let the man play the game. An H base is great. Plenty of demand and with our cheap fabs and other auppprt, he‚Äôll have lots of bases in no time. Also, some of us are willing to fly out to pick up H from others bases. Where there is a will, there is a way


[15-Nov-22 08:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
It doesn't matter. I'm just making suggestions, and he will make the decision in the end. I think it would be helpful for him to know more information. Anyway, it's a good thing to get the sponsorship of an H base, which is much better than my starting point.


[15-Nov-22 09:05 AM] churavis#0000
That's 3 or 4 industries and the opposite of specialization


[15-Nov-22 09:06 AM] yuen8241#0000
ANT's pe price is outrageous, and the PE I tentatively sold was actually sold.


[15-Nov-22 09:14 AM] allocater#0000
yes, I don't understand PE and PG price, C and H are now cheap, so lots of people should produce PE/PG


[15-Nov-22 10:53 AM] domicius#0000
I'm making PE right now on phobos. Soon moving it to Nike, but I can fill some orders

@sir_deplorable Welcome! Any questions so far? In case you missed it OOG runs a re-fueling program for all members so be sure to take advantage! Just post a LM buy ad for the fuel you need @ 8/u (SF and FF) on either ANT, Nike, or Deimos and one of our fuel makers will pick it up. You can post in the fuel ops channel when you make the ad so that we're aware of it üôÇ happy trading!

If there are few planets where our members are located, the present form is very appropriate.

[17-Nov-22 01:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think vertical columns can be arranged according to product types. A big category is placed in a nearby position, and common consumables, luxury consumables and Fabs are written in the front.

[17-Nov-22 01:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
Then we can see who is the supplier by screening items, even if the number of people is large, and we can also compare the supply location and price.


[17-Nov-22 02:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
I set up three pages, namely Consumables Price„ÄÅBase material Price„ÄÅ raw material Price


[17-Nov-22 02:29 AM] yuen8241#0000
Consumables Price is used to retrieve suppliers of required consumables, Base material Price is used to retrieve suppliers when bases are Building, and raw material Price is used to retrieve suppliers of basic raw materials and intermediate products in complex industrial chains.


[17-Nov-22 02:34 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think it's easier for users to find suppliers and compare prices and locations. In the long run, we can also help integrate the industrial chains of our members, especially in some complex industries.


[17-Nov-22 06:46 AM] gladeowl#0000
I like it. *though the columns could be a bit wider, it gets hard to read after 2 planets*


[17-Nov-22 06:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
My main consideration is that I can quickly turn to the required product list and then search it. Of course, we can also choose to wrap the text automatically.


[17-Nov-22 07:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
I didn't include the products related to shipbuilding and infrastructure maintenance in this table, because there are too many products with strong professionalism, and only the commonly used ones are kept.


[17-Nov-22 07:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
Of course, I may have forgot something . Welcome to improve and supplement it.


[17-Nov-22 07:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
I also didn't add fuel-related information, because there is a special channel, and the price and location are clear.

That's kinda concerning. We've always been pretty relaxed about the criteria for recruitment into OOG but the most important requirement has always been activity/communication and engagement in the game. When I recruit I generally try to have some back-and-forth with them to make sure they're responsive, then I ask them about their expansion plans - the response doesn't really matter (because OOG can always use more of... everything lol) but the more enthusiastic they are the better the sign that they will continue playing.

I feel like this wouldn't be as important if they would just let us kick inactive people from the corp already..... üò¨

Spreadsheets, constantly evolving spreadsheets.

Planning logistics? I just send ships to resolve whatever thing FIO says I'm running out of.


[24-Nov-22 05:01 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I would like to be more proactive and efficient rather than the current reactive approach with having giant stockpiles and a sprinkle of hopes and prayers which doesn't scale well


[24-Nov-22 05:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I used to do better with planet to planet trips, now most of my stuff goes back and forth to ANT (except full shiploads of crops, which go to specific FP planets). I made a map to help me plan routes- sometimes I can get a sequence of planets in a trip. Griff -> Nike  -> ANT, for example.

[24-Nov-22 05:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
I recommend the maps just for funsies anyway.


[24-Nov-22 05:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah, my approach is basically try to stock 10 days of consumables everywhere. Send ships from ANT to wherever is lowest. If I get sticker shock on KOM or ALE, buy 4 days supply and worry about it later.


[24-Nov-22 05:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
I kind of set up my planets to maximize logistics. The planet that needs FE/FEO also needs some lightweight gasses. Return trips from my HCC planet would be empty, so I also bring back AUO other heavy ores.


[24-Nov-22 05:06 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I aim for 25 days of consumables which I'm finding is more than the 500/500 ship for some planets now


[24-Nov-22 05:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think there's a whole lot of "route optimization" you can generally do in this game though. Many trips are going to be "here's a ship full of nothing but N, or H, or H2O, and it's only got one destination that makes sense"


[24-Nov-22 05:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's easy to lean on shipping contracts for mid-size or even fairly large loads. It sucks to try to ship 10m3 of 9 different consumables from ANT to griff, just cause it's so much clicking


[24-Nov-22 05:09 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah either multi item shipping contracts or containers would be ideal


[24-Nov-22 05:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah definitely.


[24-Nov-22 05:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
Even just fewer clicks to make a contract would be an improvement.

Since I have everyone's base placements, it would be cool to automate creating the maps, but I haven't done that

[24-Nov-22 07:16 PM] gladeowl#0000

Are you confident with a multimeter? Or do you have a UPS with a voltage display? Wondering if they are undervolted. You'd probably see issues with other stuff in your house, however.

Alternate ideas: The surge protectors just suck. The plugboard style ones might not have obvious indicators if they tripped. Some thermal fuses can auto reset after a certain amount of time.


[26-Nov-22 06:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
If the power supply on the computer tripped, some of them are reset by unplugging them from the wall, and sliding the voltage slider to 240 then back to 120. (assuming you're in the US)


[26-Nov-22 06:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
But yeah, pretty weird for them both to have issues like that. Sounds like a PSU issue if they sorta power on, but you can't get into the bios even.

I still recommend registering products as vertical columns, so that if a product is offered on multiple planets, you don't have to fill in the vertical columns repeatedly, and you don't have to add the vertical columns constantly because of the increase of planets.

minimize your small emitter count. 800-899m3 ship volume is probably better than 700-799. So you can target that with the very small bay (250/250), or if you go Tiny, you'll be in the 500-599m3 range, which can look promising:

[07-Dec-22 01:25 AM] churavis#0000
With the corp price of fuel, 1055 SF and 1316 FF only comes to 18,968$ That's peanuts for an inter CX trip


[07-Dec-22 01:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can consider buying one for urgent valuables transportation.


[07-Dec-22 01:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
The profit of bulk goods is not enough to cover the cost.


[07-Dec-22 01:27 AM] churavis#0000
If it's for saving a high tier production line from being stalled an extra day then it could be worth a couple thousand or even tens of thousands in fuel costs


[07-Dec-22 01:30 AM] yuen8241#0000
I prefer this ship to transport expensive CX commodities, because the supply and demand there fluctuate frequently, and the supply and demand of the base is relatively easy to calculate and stable.


[07-Dec-22 04:33 AM] domicius#0000
Blech. My FIO got stuck and didn't refresh, and I had to reset. I'll be spending a few days stocking bases, back after that.

[07-Dec-22 08:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe I need to wait and see to avoid the surge of INS. At least the INS left in my hand can be used as a wall to maintain the price of 200 AIC.


[07-Dec-22 08:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
My materials can also make 200 HSE , and I sold 100 in Corp before.

[07-Dec-22 08:29 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe my 6 PP3  are not enough. such as Rfabs, INS and HSE, all of which are needed.

I think you can stop HSE and focus on INS and r-fabs

Actually, I have stopped.


[07-Dec-22 01:45 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
I removed my Nike base, to get the permit back and re-use it on my new base. Should I not get it back? The base permits are showing as 6/6 in the HQ tab, but I'm only using 5? Or am I missing something obvious? :\

At my work we have a whole service dedicated to turning off other services and turning them back on again.

Bad devs like to put state into their stateless services, so we make that automatically a really bad idea.


[07-Dec-22 06:39 PM] yuen8241#0000
Why did you give Harmonia 3 permit? Are you frantically producing C?


[07-Dec-22 07:25 PM] yjhasaday#0000
I find multiple permit bases are actually a good idea the longer I play this game. When I first started I thought the same as everyone else (that area to permit ratio wasn't worth it) but once you start managing logistics for a higher number of bases every additional one seems to exponentially compound logistical problems. I think we get like 20ish permits before A-fabs are required for HQ upgrades and that's plenty to use for expansion to other planets but also focus some bases with 1000 space. So I like the idea of a 3 permit base, especially on Harmonia


[07-Dec-22 07:27 PM] churavis#0000
I'm glad I didn't do more than 1 permit bases at first because later on it allowed me to expand into higher tier production lines without having to demolish anything, I just had to add another permit


[07-Dec-22 08:18 PM] exeler#0000
This is essentially my plan


[07-Dec-22 08:18 PM] exeler#0000
Except Harmonia. If that gets another permit I'm just making more HYF.


[07-Dec-22 08:47 PM] yuen8241#0000
Three ORCs are the main building of my Harmonia. Actually, I bought my RAT from HRT and my C from ANT.


[08-Dec-22 06:25 AM] yuen8241#0000

Hi all, I've had to turn away quite a few AMM requests because I was backlogged with demand over the last few months. So I wanted to let you all know that I've expanded my AMM operation and done a bunch of repairs so I now have some surplus to sell if any of you need it. I know its used in smaller amounts in fermenting and chemistry so I thought I would lay an FYI here in general for everyone. The following is currently available:

1000 AMM on Nike @ 75/u
*~~1000~~* 600 AMM on QJ-382g @ 60/u

Hi guys, I made a poll to help us shape the OOG gas station locations. Please take a minute to submit a response (its only 2 checkbox questions), no promises to anything but this will help us identify the common shipping routes among our group and hopefully improving your re-fueling experience! So please fill it out honestly. You can check multiple boxes for each question.

I accepted a contract to become a Gov, doesn't work if you already are one


[15-Dec-22 03:22 PM] churavis#0000
So it doesn't accept reelection as a satisfaction of the governor contract?


[15-Dec-22 03:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
It worked for me


[15-Dec-22 03:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
The QJ-650c election ended while I had the contract, to be clear.


[15-Dec-22 03:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
I had 5 days left til the election ended when I accepted it, and it triggered as soon as it ended.


[15-Dec-22 03:31 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Ok so it must only trigger on state changes to the election process? I'm not going to be reelected as it's just temporary for Allocater


[15-Dec-22 03:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I think it only triggers on the successful election change. But no shortage of small planets out there you could grab. Ice Station Alpha could use a governor


[16-Dec-22 01:12 AM] allocater#0000
you can run again if you want, but I guess the contract decays before the next election?

I just asked whether they were going to nerf some overabused MMs that were causing inflation.


[16-Dec-22 11:41 PM] dehzhas#0000
Seems to me that MMs aren't really on the radar as having a problem of any kind from the brief moment they mentioned it.


[17-Dec-22 12:05 AM] churavis#0000
Apparently not


[17-Dec-22 12:20 AM] domicius#0000
Like which MMs?


[17-Dec-22 12:23 AM] churavis#0000
Software mostly as it has no inputs, so IDC and EDC

[17-Dec-22 06:35 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I have a good profitable MM chain and with that I have plenty of money and don‚Äôt have to interact with anyone other than a couple of inputs and consumables


[17-Dec-22 06:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
As players age up, it empties the CX or even in corp trade


[17-Dec-22 06:36 AM] jackinabox86#0000
All the other things I do, fuel, prefabs, etc. is basically just to meet others needs, not for profit


[17-Dec-22 06:45 AM] gladeowl#0000
That's interesting. I'm assuming MMs were created to control the prices to an extent, so something never got too cheap or too expensive.
Would this become a problem without MMs?


[17-Dec-22 06:46 AM] gladeowl#0000
SF or FF shooting to 40-50/u because of scalpers or just lack of supply.


[17-Dec-22 06:59 AM] allocater#0000
my issue is only with the buying MMs


[17-Dec-22 07:31 AM] churavis#0000
The higher tier MMs seem to be for stimulating demand in higher rier production buildings that otherwise would see little use and not be worth it. I'm order to get rid of them developers would need to do something to increase natural demand.

For example, drone shops are useless because large infrastructure buildings aren't worth it compared to just adding more small ones and RDS/RDL aren't worth it for LHP ships, which are most ships because higher tier ship plates aren't worth it financially unless you just want to go really fast and guzzle horrendous amounts of fuel.
So to get rid of higher tier MMs they would need to rebalance a lot of systems


[17-Dec-22 07:37 AM] rune_242#0000
do DW, OFF and SUN give the same value for a SST?

I produced a bunch of EDCs. In fact, this one is really profitable and worry-free. Considering that many products and industries that I am involved in take up a lot of energy and capacity, and I need foreign exchange for a long time, this is very helpful to me.


[17-Dec-22 08:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, the development team should indeed reduce the income of EDC or increase its use. MM can provide liquidity, but the inflation caused by excess liquidity is also very serious.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[17-Dec-22 08:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
Perhaps a factional contract to purchase a large number of consumables or other products is an alternative solution to provide liquidity. This new liquidity will be more evenly distributed among more players and industries, rather than being monopolized by MM producers.


[17-Dec-22 08:42 AM] domicius#0000
Yeah, I use the software MMs to make quite a bit of money, but mainly that means I spend huge amounts on high tier consumables. Enough that I've had to branch out into actually making some of them myself because otherwise it was a bit of a wash financially. It's easy mode in a way.   Software is a bit wierd anyway,  but the main issue is the relative lack of inputs.


[17-Dec-22 08:43 AM] domicius#0000
Also, repairing the SW buildings requires pretty much all Rfabs. It's very expensive.


[17-Dec-22 08:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have basically been self-sufficient in EDC consumables and Rfabs.


[17-Dec-22 08:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
But I found many MMs producers who don't produce anything other than MMs.


[17-Dec-22 09:28 AM] domicius#0000
It serves a purpose if you don't want to do too much shipping. I guess its a matter of playstyle too. So people just want to play multiplayer solitaire, and software fills that void.


[17-Dec-22 09:29 AM] domicius#0000
Whereas agriculture is so wide, its really hard to make everything (for example)


[17-Dec-22 01:53 PM] erklein#0000
I think it would be more interesting to see more of the higher tier population buildings. Is it that the upkeep materials are too expensive to maintain them that they aren't used much, or just the upfront cost of higher building materials?


[17-Dec-22 01:53 PM] churavis#0000
Both


[17-Dec-22 01:59 PM] erklein#0000
Do you think it would change if instead of leveling up infrastructure requires more of the same materials, they instead require higher tier fabs to level up?


[17-Dec-22 02:02 PM] churavis#0000
The solution is to make the more complex large buildings give more satisfaction while requiring a more complex supply chain so that long term players, the kind who become governors of the biggest planets, can have a reason to build complex supply chains for higher tier products


[17-Dec-22 02:02 PM] churavis#0000
Also, there should be a bonus for fulfilling all the upkeep consumables so that you can't just get away with supplying the easiest thing


[17-Dec-22 02:03 PM] erklein#0000
Ooh, I like the bonus for fulfilling all idea


[17-Dec-22 02:04 PM] churavis#0000
Right, because it means you have to figure out how to make or source some complex items, adding to the difficulty for only those who are looking for it


[17-Dec-22 02:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I think EDCs are also particularly egregious because they eat up all of the rfabs. Most of the other chains don‚Äôt just devour the rfabs needed for hq upgrades and everything else


[17-Dec-22 02:26 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I stopped at 7 and did a different chain


[18-Dec-22 01:51 AM] allocater#0000
yeah, these numbers are not balanced, if drones would give more they would be used for popi

The other one is Illyriad. http://www.illyriad.co.uk/ This one is more like an online civ game in a heroic fantasy setup, with humans, elves, dwarves and orcs. The players build their cities on the global map, build buildings in their cities, gather ressources (8 basic types), produce from these resources other goods (essentially weapons and armours, several dozens of different types),  perform research (to unlock buildings, units, increase productivity or military power), trade with other players and fight with other players (like city raids that allow to capture enemies' resources). There are player driven trade hubs, and player driven trade, with free market prices. One can actually trade on bid/ask spreads in trade hubs. There are caravans to transport goods between cities. These caravans can be raided by the way.

@demannu  and I played this a while back. The dev was not so great on security, so if you play this make sure to use a password you definitely don't use anywhere else.


[19-Dec-22 11:31 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

@exeler Did you get your password stolen?


[19-Dec-22 11:33 AM] exeler#0000
The main draw for me with Barons was that you can script all of your units. So instead of logging in regularly to move things about like we do here, you can set up loops for your transports (and even military units). This massively expands each player's ability to scale. So the maps are usually full of units buzzing around and it looks like there's a ton of activity (and there is), but the playerbase is small.


[19-Dec-22 11:34 AM] exeler#0000
something like that üòÖ


[19-Dec-22 11:37 AM] exeler#0000
Also in Barons, since a lot of routines are scripted, and the old players have their shipments timed to keep the prices of things in major cities stable while squeezing out the max profit, you can engage in some fun economic warfare by tanking the price of a particularly important good in a city. This is usually why the really big players settle planets in the far reaches of the galaxy by themselves where they can control everything.


[19-Dec-22 11:38 AM] yang_mills#0000
Oh, this is bad.


[19-Dec-22 11:42 AM] demannu#0000
@yang_mills 
It's actually how I met @exeler lmao

It's a very fun game, but the dev is definitely owned by the 2 whales that keep the game funded. You'll see dev intervention when the whales aren't happy (such as exelers suggested economic warfare)

And also the old timers have more or less automated the game via scripts and extensions

I can give you the codebase for my extensions and automation for the game if you're interested


[19-Dec-22 11:43 AM] demannu#0000
It also includes a discord bot and scraper for news and economic stats so you can keep tabs and attempt to keep the dev honest


[19-Dec-22 11:44 AM] churavis#0000
Not sure I want to play a game where the devs don't keep themselves honest


[19-Dec-22 11:44 AM] yang_mills#0000

[19-Dec-22 11:50 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its very similar to a game I played in the early 2000's, except the map was a grid coordinate schtick and you had to manually plot your way to bases, asteroids, planets, exchanges, etc. That and the UI/UX was late 90s based trash.

Yeah me too lmao. Part of my motivation of learning all I know was to revive games I played as a kid


[19-Dec-22 11:52 AM] demannu#0000
The other one is Hackwars


[19-Dec-22 11:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hah nice


[19-Dec-22 11:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Don't think I ever tried that one


[19-Dec-22 11:52 AM] demannu#0000
Tldr hacking sim with a JavaScript runtime interpreter. It allowed you to script actions and hacks and websites in game


[19-Dec-22 11:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
PU really is, in many ways, a modern successor to ME. I was amazed by how similar a lot of the mechanics and such are. That being I've never found a game prior that scratched the ME itch.


[19-Dec-22 11:53 AM] demannu#0000
When I get off work tonight I'll spin up an Ooga instance of ME


[19-Dec-22 11:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahhh okay, I played a similar game at one point


[19-Dec-22 11:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
ME-Ooga, you ooga, we all ooga for space fantasy?


[19-Dec-22 11:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I vaguely remember obsessively building my base in secret between major trade lanes, slowly building up all the infra needed to create my own ships. That was... Fuck, I must've been in junior high still.


[19-Dec-22 11:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I turn 31 in 2 months, and I'm pretty sure I was somewhere between 7th and 9th grade at the time. 12-14 years old, or some such.


[19-Dec-22 11:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Give or take a few.


[19-Dec-22 11:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Good times.


[19-Dec-22 11:56 AM] demannu#0000
I was lurking on the IRC for astro empires when I was like 8? And found merchant empires cause it was being hosted on the same server


[19-Dec-22 11:56 AM] demannu#0000
I'll be 30 next year


[19-Dec-22 11:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I remember astro empires too, met some amazing people there.


[19-Dec-22 11:57 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Edit: pretty confident* I got into astro from ME, so same but opposite


[19-Dec-22 11:57 AM] demannu#0000
Lmao


[19-Dec-22 11:57 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its legit crazy feeling to bump into someone else who also played a weird niche game like that


[19-Dec-22 11:57 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Though not entirely surprising, this being an equally weird niche game of the same genre


[19-Dec-22 11:59 AM] demannu#0000
Haven't found anyone in like 10 years that remembered it


[19-Dec-22 12:00 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Same, you're the first person who knows what the hell I'm even talking about. I tried googling it and apparently there's some new garbage game that uses the name merchant empires, and its not even a space game.


[19-Dec-22 12:01 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Guess I got invited to exactly the right corp üòõ


[19-Dec-22 12:01 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Shit, what are the odds... I'm honestly still amazed.


[19-Dec-22 12:16 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Not really sure what I should price my raw goods at, so I'm currently putting my production output and input requisition/requirement numbers in the raw mat price tab, with a $? for price (which I'll fill in as soon as I find out what other corpies sell at, so I can anchor price at internal baseline)


[19-Dec-22 12:16 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Currently doing between 12-144 BEA/NUT/MAI on Harmonia between 12 FRMs, so roughly 48/day average, if you're going 1:1:1 for RAT production.


[19-Dec-22 12:17 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
On a contract for the next 3 weeks though, but after that I'll be free to sell it all.


[19-Dec-22 12:19 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Wait... is the @50 etc how much you're buying for, or selling for?


[19-Dec-22 12:20 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Cause some of these numbers look kinda wonky


[19-Dec-22 12:21 PM] allocater#0000
it is a bit of a parallel economy to the exchange, but those are all discounted materials for sale


[19-Dec-22 12:21 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like, 50 for OVEs in Antares is crazy cheap, roughly 50-75% below market price


[19-Dec-22 12:21 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ahhh okay


[19-Dec-22 12:23 PM] allocater#0000
also CX prices have been going up lately, but we seldom adjust the sheet for it


[19-Dec-22 12:23 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
That explains it. Was confused by ALO, for example, being listed at 40, 45, and 60 by different people, while on the exchange its currently 42B/48S


[19-Dec-22 12:23 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

ALO recently crashed, don't buy it for 60, it's a scam üòÑ


[19-Dec-22 12:25 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
If so then I'll pick the lowest listed price on the sheet and anchor to that. Pretty pointless pricing above it anyway


[19-Dec-22 12:25 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah I did a double-take at 60 lolol


[19-Dec-22 12:25 PM] allocater#0000
nah, you don't really have to offer discounted goods early on


[19-Dec-22 12:26 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Eh I mean. If it saves me transpo costs and helps the corpmates, its all good.

I'm very slowly buying back my profits in the form of raw mats to fabricate construction mats to build my second BMP  on Deimos right now. A few hours til I can start construction, then its a few more days til the 2nd PP1.


[19-Dec-22 12:27 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Trying to keep my liquid at roughly 50% of my starting funds, which I think were like 40k AIC


[19-Dec-22 12:30 PM] allocater#0000
if you still have room on harmonia, I keep a stash of b-fabs for farm constructions you can get with delayed payment of 30d, because we always need more farms and we are all on our limits already


[19-Dec-22 12:30 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
@allocater I see you've a buy order up for 1.3k ALO at 42 ea. If you're cool buying on Deimos, I can just sell you my daily production of 28 direct. Dunno if that's where you're using it though. If not, then I'll keep selling it on the exchange. Pretty sure you're the only one I've been selling to anyway LOL


[19-Dec-22 12:31 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Sadly I've maxed out Harmonia. Might end up extending the permit later, but right now I'm running 12 FRM/4 RIG on contract for the next 3 weeks.


[19-Dec-22 12:31 PM] allocater#0000
perfect, then on to building up deimos üòÑ


[19-Dec-22 12:32 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I should've negotiated a buyback stipulation so I could at least make a little profit in the process üòõ 3 weeks production with zero income is harsh. 100% of my income is coming from my tiny Deimos op üòÑ


[19-Dec-22 12:32 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
At least its only 3 weeks then I'll be making pure moneys


[19-Dec-22 12:32 PM] dehzhas#0000
@xenoxerarch your Heph base + HQ upgrade will be ready in a few hours


[19-Dec-22 12:33 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Sweeeeet


[19-Dec-22 12:33 PM] allocater#0000
I am mostly just saving ALO from being destroyed, I don't use any on deimos and only do limited smelting on hephaestus. But we need a lot of smelters on deimos as well.


[19-Dec-22 12:33 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll task a ship over, got one arriving at ZV-896 orbit in 4 hrs


[19-Dec-22 12:34 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Do you think it might be better for me to build a smelter on deimos rather than keep expanding my BMP/PP1s?


[19-Dec-22 12:34 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
At least this early on? Since extractors only seem to cost BSE and space gravel. Whatever the hell its called. MGT? MTP?


[19-Dec-22 12:34 PM] allocater#0000
with ALO at all time low and AL at all-time high, smelters are definitly in high demand


[19-Dec-22 12:35 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hrm... Let's see what a smelter costs


[19-Dec-22 12:35 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
How's O prices and availability though, viable?


[19-Dec-22 12:35 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
If so then I'll just put up a smelter and work off of that


[19-Dec-22 12:35 PM] allocater#0000
O is also tanking, the only hard part is the C now, and AL smelting is a gold mine


[19-Dec-22 12:36 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Nice.


[19-Dec-22 12:36 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Alright, smelter it is.


[19-Dec-22 12:36 PM] churavis#0000
O is in a bit higher demand. I'd definitely buy some if you were selling. Etherwind is the closest source besides Deimos


[19-Dec-22 12:36 PM] rune_242#0000
I have a overproduction of 105 C/day right now


[19-Dec-22 12:36 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'll definitely buy C off of you. I need it on Deimos constantly


[19-Dec-22 12:37 PM] churavis#0000
I have 25 inc on Nascent so I also always have C


[19-Dec-22 12:38 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
So hold on, do we have AL smelters on Deimos who need ALO/O? If so, maybe it'd be best for all if I make an O facility and sell them O/ALO, rather than smelt myself.


[19-Dec-22 12:39 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I know its probably more profitable to smelt myself, but if we have deficits, its more efficient in terms of space.


[19-Dec-22 12:40 PM] exeler#0000
I never have trouble sourcing ALO, and I use hundreds a day. O is also pretty easy to grab off the CX.


[19-Dec-22 12:40 PM] churavis#0000
I make ALO and C on Nascent (and sell it there for cheap) and O from Etherwind


[19-Dec-22 12:41 PM] churavis#0000
We have a dedicated ALO extractor already


[19-Dec-22 12:41 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm. Looks like there's 15k ALO supply on the Alt CX, and only 1k demand (entirely @allocater lol), while O is at 15.7k Sup/9.5k demand.


[19-Dec-22 12:42 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Meanwhile AL is at 3.9k sup/3.2k demand. Yeah AL direct is a wider margin by the looks of it.


[19-Dec-22 12:42 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Definitely an overabundance of O/ALO right now.


[19-Dec-22 12:42 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

[19-Dec-22 12:49 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

[19-Dec-22 12:49 PM] churavis#0000
It's probably due to us developing Nascent and taking our demand off the market


[19-Dec-22 12:49 PM] churavis#0000
Same thing happened with C


[19-Dec-22 12:49 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is Nascent in Antares sector? Don't recall seeing the name


[19-Dec-22 12:50 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
Yep it is


[19-Dec-22 12:50 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
QJ-149 - Nascent (QJ-149c)


[19-Dec-22 12:50 PM] paxmagellanic#0000
I think


[19-Dec-22 12:50 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, though not super close and was only recently named


[19-Dec-22 12:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah, nice. Colonization looks interesting, I definitely want to get in on that action eventually. Zero clue how much it costs to establish and maintain all that infra though.


[19-Dec-22 12:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Ah, QJ is in a neighboring sector


[19-Dec-22 12:51 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Antares is ZV


[19-Dec-22 12:52 PM] churavis#0000
Building it is expensive but maintaining it not so much


[19-Dec-22 12:52 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Might be using the wrong term though. I assume sector is what we called the collection of same-prefix systems


[19-Dec-22 12:52 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
hundred grand expensive or tens of millions expensive?


[19-Dec-22 12:52 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

[19-Dec-22 01:10 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's not bad at all. Right now I can only afford 1 smelter though. Well, I have the mats homemade for 1, and have 20k AIC liquid I keep in reserve to buy inputs and invest as I produce my own BSE/BBH/etc.


[19-Dec-22 01:11 PM] rune_242#0000
but you can pay it back in 30 days if you want


[19-Dec-22 01:12 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Do you think it'd be better to go straight smelters rather than ALO extractors and O collectors  with SMEs to offset inputs?


[19-Dec-22 01:13 PM] churavis#0000
Specializing does offer massive efficiency bonuses so you'll likely end up doing it eventually anyways


[19-Dec-22 01:13 PM] gladeowl#0000
I'll happily sell you the ALO at 60/u üòè

[19-Dec-22 01:13 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm. Is that due to the experts feature? I just started getting experts and I've gotten 3 on Harmonia with my 12 FRMs compared to only one on Deimos, which only affects one of my 3 different industry types


[19-Dec-22 01:13 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
XD


[19-Dec-22 01:14 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm sure you'd love to sell ALO for 60/u üòõ


[19-Dec-22 01:15 PM] churavis#0000
It's due to the fact that efficiency categories compound together so 25% COGC and 28% 5 expert stack becomes 160% efficiency


[19-Dec-22 01:15 PM] rune_242#0000
this is massive


[19-Dec-22 01:15 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oh wow okay yeah that's serious bonus territory right there


[19-Dec-22 01:15 PM] rune_242#0000
compared to the 100% effiency of COL and EXT on deimos


[19-Dec-22 01:16 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Efficiency only affects production time, right, not input or output?


[19-Dec-22 01:16 PM] rune_242#0000
I also have 4k FLX on griffonstone if you need any


[19-Dec-22 01:16 PM] rune_242#0000
exactly


[19-Dec-22 01:17 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Still, that's a huge bonus.


[19-Dec-22 01:17 PM] churavis#0000
Correct, but that does mean you save on consumables and area, which is the biggest bottleneck mid game


[19-Dec-22 01:17 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its good that it doesn't affect input/output, it means at least that aspect is static, and you ony end up pumping out more and buying more inputs as you become more efficient


[19-Dec-22 01:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah consumable cost is a function of time, not amount of product produced, so speeding your production time can be pretty helpful in that way.


[19-Dec-22 01:21 PM] rune_242#0000
@xenoxerarch would you like these fabs?


[19-Dec-22 01:21 PM] rune_242#0000

Are wipes a periodic timed thing, or just 'alright major update breaks the universe, wipe time y'all'


[19-Dec-22 01:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
They are planning another one, but it's not expected for a while.


[19-Dec-22 01:52 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Good to know.


[19-Dec-22 01:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Basically not until they have enough breaking changes piled up that they can't apply to the existing universe


[19-Dec-22 01:53 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's about as good a protocol as one could ask for. Not frivolous scheduled wipes like some games. I'm okay with that.

@xenoxerarch Welcome to OOG! I'm just catching up now but it looks like you have already been directed to the #welcome and #rules-faq, check those out and let us know if you have any questions.

Don't hesitate to take advantage of the corp rates on our spreadsheet - I agree with allocater above, you shouldn't worry about trying to match our prices at this stage, just enjoy the stable, low prices üòé ! We're still making profit on these prices and they help you grow faster so its a win-win for everyone.

I tried to read most of what I missed today but its quite a bit so I did some skimming lol; have you mentioned what industry you're in or what your plans are for expansion?! Let us know, its always fun to hear what plans new OOG-ers come up with and see how we can help out!

[20-Dec-22 04:31 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Sweet! One question though, if ANT means Antares Statio, is it even possible to local market trade there directly without using the CX? I can only put up shipping ads there for some reason.


[20-Dec-22 04:32 PM] allocater#0000
on ant we use custom contracts or CX if there is no activity

I am trying to learn to type my info in excel but it seems too hard to learn. Can anyone tell me on which page I should insert data on?


[26-Dec-22 03:25 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
If you don't know the basics at least, I suggest a youtube tutorial on basic excel. That'll teach you enough to figure it out.


[26-Dec-22 03:28 AM] martin1194#0000
I know how to use excel. But I not sure which page I need to put my info inside. Only "Price" and "Player Activity and Base List"?


[26-Dec-22 03:30 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Price is got corp priced goods. If you're new, and still pretty broke, don't bother. Just use that page as a reference for when you'd like to buy from fellow corps. On planet tab just scroll down to where I just put TreeBear in the lefthand column in green and fill in the industries you own on whichever planet you have bases on

goodluck 

[26-Dec-22 03:31 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
As for the base list tab... I haven't even put my stuff on their yet lol, so I'll take a look and get back to you on that.

I think I haven't any detail need to type in "Planet" tab. becuz my base in VH-331a.

And as a new player, you can take a couple weeks to figure out what you want to focus on


[26-Dec-22 09:41 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Yep, I got your PM, sorry again for missing it! Filled now


[26-Dec-22 09:56 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Welcome to OOG @martin1194! Don't worry too much about the spreadsheet right now, at this point it is more a resource for you to see which of us can supply you. Once you expand a bit you can start helping out and list some of your items. As mentioned above the only tabs you need to focus on are the first two - "Planets" and "Prices". The others are ongoing experiments or data caches that we're playing with.

Please take a moment to read through the #welcome and #rules-faq channels - let us know if you have any questions! Also can you let me know which planets you are on for your roles?


[26-Dec-22 10:13 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Anyone else having problems with FIO? It still loads for me but it has been weeks (I think) since the burn rates for my consumables were accurate. If there is another site that people use for managing consumable burn rates/stocks let me know!


[26-Dec-22 10:41 AM] jackinabox86#0000
You may need to logout and relog on the extension for prun


[26-Dec-22 10:41 AM] jackinabox86#0000
They did an update that logged people out so their data isn‚Äôt flowing over to fio. Easy fix


[26-Dec-22 11:54 AM] martin1194#0000
Good. XenoXerarch helped me put the name on "Planets" tab, but there is no planet I can add. HAHA.
I will try my best to provide produce in "Prices" tab.

I did a lot of LM scouting when I was new bc I couldn't do anything else with 3 buildings


[27-Dec-22 07:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
In the cycle of fabs price increase, it is faster than production to sell all the initial materials and then make money through CX.


[27-Dec-22 07:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
A lot of new players dream of running a shipping empire, technically possible. Financially not too great, but that's not obvious when you start at first.


[27-Dec-22 07:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Although buying bulk loads and selling them on the CX seems more viable than doing shipping contracts. That 500 N could be worth a cool 33,500 AIC on the CX, And 13,500 profit is better than you'd get with a shipping contract generally


[27-Dec-22 07:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
In the early stage of the game, because players have less capital, it is more profitable to make profits through cross-CX trading than to directly start low-end industrial production.


[27-Dec-22 07:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have tested it before. I sold the original materials for cross-cx transactions, and the time to earn the first 200,000 AIC was greatly advanced. I can wait until I have enough funds to buy back the building materials before starting over.


[27-Dec-22 07:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
The payback period of planet like deimos is usually about 15 days. But if you are lucky in the market, you will soon double it.


[27-Dec-22 09:58 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I made a lot of extra cash shipping LST from Nike to the CX when I started back, it paid better than shipping contracts and was more reliable.


[28-Dec-22 12:21 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hey folks. Question. How do I trade currency? Someone paid me in... ICA? Whatever the hell that is.

[02-Jan-23 03:58 PM] xenoxerarch#0000

[02-Jan-23 03:58 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
though I do tend to fly at minimum fuel, or about as close to it as I can get


[02-Jan-23 04:00 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I always go at least one click above minimum fuel. For like 80 AIC you go wayyy faster


[02-Jan-23 04:01 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is it just me or is there a weird bug where if you click the fuel bar repeatedly on the same tick it'll use the same amount of fuel but give vastly different times? I've been shaving off an hour or two on my travel times by doing this and it feels... broken, or like I'm not understanding something going on in the background

Hey guys... yeah I'm back. Small PSA: I got utterly wrecked with some sort of stomach illness. I'm alive but will now be playing catch up on all the deliveries/payments I owe everyone.

This might be a stupid question.. is it worth buying luxury consumables for pioneers? (does the speed-up somehow cover the expense)

[04-Jan-23 01:58 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yes, it's nearly always worth buying luxuries. Try the Prunner app for base planning if spreadsheets aren't your thing.

Got baited by a guy that wanted to get into a long term contract and ended up building 70 RIGS on Etherwind. So if someone wants a stable delivery of water let me know. Making about 3k per day. Can deliver it for 23/u or you pick it up for 20/u from Etherwind.

Welcome @camodragon09! We operate primarily in the Antares area, some of us have bases in the Benton/Hortus areas but we don't list them on our corp spreadsheet (already so many planet columns üòÖ  - hopefully you were able to view the sheet from the #welcome page?). It can be helpful to have some folks settled in areas outside of Antares to bring in some supplies that aren't easily available in our region, if you're interested in something like that? I know us fuel makers are always looking for HE3 lol

You're welcome to hang around here for a week or so and take advantage of our group pricing and fuel stations, then if you don't see a future in Antares you can head back to Benton. Let us know if you have any questions!

I am pretty sure the consumable request is buggy. It might trigger whenever you have less than 3 or 5 of something, like VG (even when 5 VG lasts you 4 weeks)


[09-Jan-23 10:10 AM] habix3956#0000
how does the game handle 4.2 consumption per day, since the inventory is displayed with whole numbers?


[09-Jan-23 10:12 AM] gladeowl#0000
From what I've seen. It consumes the 1 unit, visually. But still factors the remaining 0.8 into future calculations.


[09-Jan-23 10:40 AM] habix3956#0000
oh ok, so it has some sort of internal buffer


[09-Jan-23 11:12 AM] archielvahr#0000

The Magic OOG Search Box has been upgraded to handle searching for common one letter materials like "O" and "C" better. It prioritizes exact matches higher, so "O @ 40" will show up before "COF @ 350" when you search for "O"

Agreed. I wasn't an official OOG member at the time though, so it wasn't my place to push any further. The convo only came up because he or someone else questions how the hell I already had 3 bases after like a week, and I expressed that it was thanks to associating with well-developed corp players with good networks and sponsorships.

[10-Jan-23 07:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think the lowest investment but the highest income in ANT area is to build BMP on heph.


[10-Jan-23 07:58 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Threshold in what sense?


[10-Jan-23 08:00 PM] yuen8241#0000

You can constantly change your products through market conditions, and it's also very close from heph to ANT.

[10-Jan-23 08:03 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Especially since I already have a Heph base, and could just as easily convert some of my FPs into BMPs, as both only seem to need basic prefabs


[10-Jan-23 08:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you have more bases, the advantage of switching production frequently in order to obtain this part of profits will not be obvious. But in the early days of the game, this part of the profit is still considerable.


[10-Jan-23 08:06 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
For sure. When I just had the starter construction setup on deimos, I survived by jumping between OVE, EXO, PT, and a few other things. EXO/PT especially seemed to sell really well at the CX, and I supplied my own PP1 mats for.... BDEs I think it was


[10-Jan-23 08:07 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its why I started with a con setup in the first place. Seemed very versatile. Sourcing all the dozen different inputs was a different issue altogether though, at least when I didn't know anyone and had to rely on volatile CX pricing.


[10-Jan-23 08:08 PM] yuen8241#0000
PWO and OFF are the most profitable now. Considering the sales volume, choose PWO.


[10-Jan-23 08:13 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Holy shit o.O PRUNner suggests net profit over 100k for 20 BMPs producing PWOs

BMP is a pain to source for the volumes you can sell


[10-Jan-23 08:15 PM] yuen8241#0000
Therefore, you need to have a very good ability to manage inventory and sales network.


[10-Jan-23 08:15 PM] jackinabox86#0000
yeah, but at the end of the day, for all that work, you have BMP products


[10-Jan-23 08:15 PM] jackinabox86#0000
not exactly drones for a damn similar amount of work


[10-Jan-23 08:16 PM] yuen8241#0000
In order to save trouble, I usually produce PE/MCG, and I produce OFF/EXO/PWO/PT according to my own needs.


[10-Jan-23 08:16 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I run PE myself; the occasional OFF


[10-Jan-23 08:17 PM] yuen8241#0000
But in the early stage of the game, when your capital is far less than your energy, it is good to make money through this.


[10-Jan-23 08:18 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Vaguely recall someone mentioning they like to have a BMP on each of their bases just to produce consumables when needed, and that sounds more and more clever the more bases I get lol


[10-Jan-23 08:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
MCG and PE  usually have opposite price trends. When PE goes up, MCG goes down, which is very interesting.


[10-Jan-23 08:18 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Huh, any idea why? That's odd.


[10-Jan-23 08:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think it's stupid. I'd rather produce consumables from manufacturing /FP base and transport them to all bases for storage.


[10-Jan-23 08:19 PM] jackinabox86#0000
omg I hate that so much.  Goes against everything I believe!  It's a lot harder to source the inputs for a ton of consumables than it is to just source the consumables  to say nothing of the loss of efficiency

[10-Jan-23 08:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
Consumables should consider production efficiency and difficulty of raw material management. Place a BMP in each base. Neither of these two things can be done.


[10-Jan-23 08:22 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Aye, it really is the most profitable to maximize efficiency by focusing on the singular industry, but I do wonder how many people take a more generalized approach where they build an fp and bmp on each base and make their own consumables as needed. It'd be horribly inefficient in PU, but I can see players from other similar games doing this. It was very common in Merchant Empires, where I originally come from, though the hyper-efficient min-maxers obviously made more money in bulk and margin trading.


[10-Jan-23 08:23 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I'm sure there are those that do it


[10-Jan-23 08:23 PM] jackinabox86#0000
I doubt many non-min-maxxers remain in this game for long


[10-Jan-23 08:23 PM] jackinabox86#0000
it's not exactly rewarding in other ways!


[10-Jan-23 08:24 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Technically, as long as they're small and limited to a base, and will source all their inputs from the CX and sell to CX as well, it works. Worked for me when I started, though the profit margins were garbage compared to what I make now.


[10-Jan-23 08:25 PM] yuen8241#0000
I think at least doing so in this game will lead to making less money and spending more energy.

In fact, if you pursue profit, you should consider whether the degree of energy spent is appropriate.

[10-Jan-23 08:28 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its a bit ironic, really. I almost didn't join PU because of all the negative reviews complaining there's nothing to do and you just log in for 5 minutes then ignore the game for 1-3 days, but I figured it might be something to do with their playstyle. As I know now, as soon as you're out of the super early game, there's plenty of room to dick around, minmax, trade, travel, prospect, and the like.


[10-Jan-23 08:29 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I probably spend easily an hour or two on PU daily right now, though less now that @dehzhas has my Heph needs taken care of. The energy/time gained from no longer having to worry about Heph is why I'm going for this Griff base. Once I get Griff efficient and self-sufficient in terms of supply, via the right contracts, I can then move onto base #5, and so on.


[10-Jan-23 08:30 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Seeing some of you nutjobs with 12-15 bases makes me wonder if you're either a masochist, or just figured out one hell of an efficient logistical system

[10-Jan-23 08:30 PM] yuen8241#0000
Usually, the longer you play, the more energy you need to pay. This is contrary to most games.


[10-Jan-23 08:30 PM] jackinabox86#0000
also, having several ships makes it easier


[10-Jan-23 08:30 PM] jackinabox86#0000
removing cargo constraints helps


[10-Jan-23 08:32 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's because most games feature a totally different type of growth curve. Here you can just keep piling on more bases if you can afford it, though there's nothing stopping someone from just chilling with 1, 2, or 3 bases throughout their entire PU career.


[10-Jan-23 08:32 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm actually curious as to who has the most bases in the game, and how many exactly

the MMs are static though, so who knows.  I just know there are a lot of QoL features that could make it easier


[10-Jan-23 08:43 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
I get why there's an inevitable problem. Nothing's forcing them to build beyond their ability to effectively manage, but if the main 'grab' is 'more base, more build', though, it naturally incentives people to keep on increasing their footprint until it becomes entirely unmanageable within the existing UI/UX framework. Adding more QoL/Automation might remedy that a bit, but it'll just end up pushing the 'end game' threshold a bit higher, rather than truly fix anything.


[10-Jan-23 08:43 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Though one might argue its not really a fixable thing; more just people being people.


[10-Jan-23 08:47 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
...This is why I mostly play idle/incremental games these days, and no longer bother with MMO's. üòõ All games inevitably get reduced down to 'number go up, dopamine go boop', and no matter how many buttons and graphics and sounds and colors and fancy bells and whistles you add, it all ultimately boils down to the same end result. We're forever chasing a certain high, and most people don't even understand why or how it works.

Want 200 AL btw? Just a few minutes til I finish the last batch

Alright, sending a cont for the full 230 batch, it'll be ready for fulfillment in... 19 minutes. Could you send me the prefab conts on ANT too? I'll take the non-BSE ones


[11-Jan-23 06:55 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Is it profitable though?


[11-Jan-23 06:57 PM] churavis#0000
I am smelting SI on WU-070a, I can increase capacity there if there is demand for SI in the corp

Wonder how fast I can send my ship from ANT to Deimos... Think I'll go for my first-ever speedy run for the hell of it. I'd rather not wait til tomorrow afternoon to build this damn base lol.

It's usually pretty quick, a few hours even for starter ships


[11-Jan-23 06:59 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Nice. If I push it to the limit, hopefully I can upgrade HQ, build the base, and get my first cycle of CL started* before* I have to sleep tonight. edit: Brain, cmon, English pls

How much do you consume on a daily basis though


[11-Jan-23 07:03 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Or do you ship it offworld

Anyone else notice basic prefab prices on the CX have skyrocketed lately?


[11-Jan-23 07:07 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Not really, or my orders would have sold, they're priced pretty low


[11-Jan-23 07:09 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's most just because some dude slightly undercut your BSE ask lol


[11-Jan-23 07:09 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
The BDE's are way higher at a handful for 1750 and the bulk around 2k/u


[11-Jan-23 07:10 PM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hm yeah it looks like its mainly just BDE's that skewed higher today


[11-Jan-23 07:18 PM] churavis#0000

So he's Russian? But Russia is neither short of water nor energy or wood. Why does it like to buy water or C so much?ü§£


[13-Jan-23 02:19 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
More likely he's Polish, judging by the previous discussion. Grozny seems to exist in various regional languages. I only knew about Russian at the time, but its definitely in Polish as well.


[13-Jan-23 02:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
But Grozny is the capital of Chechnya.


[13-Jan-23 02:28 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yep! I just joked about that too üòõ


[13-Jan-23 02:28 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Such a fucked up name


[13-Jan-23 02:30 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We think he might be polish specifically because of the 'nie' part of the name. Though, just having a name in a certain language doesn't guarantee anything. Plenty of people have usernames in all sorts of languages.


[13-Jan-23 02:32 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that Nie means no in Polish.


[13-Jan-23 02:33 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yep. Niegrozny specifically meaning 'harmless' in Polish. Grozny, by itself, meaning 'harmful, horrible, terrible, frightening, cruel'


[13-Jan-23 02:33 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
So the capitol of Chechnya has probably the most fucked up name I've ever seen in a city.

[13-Jan-23 02:35 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
But yeah, apparently capitol of Chechnya is named after an old russian leader who was a bit of an asshole


[13-Jan-23 02:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
In June, 1818, 5,000 Russian imperial soldiers spent four months building a fortress on the lower Sunzha River. Because it was considered as the hottest place in the North Caucasus at that time and the most conflicted place, the fortress was named "Terrible Fortress" (–∫—Ä–µ–ø–Ω–æ—Å).They intend to shock the region with the title of Ivan the Terrible.


[13-Jan-23 02:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yep. Looks like the name dates back to the late 1800s after the Caucasus war


[13-Jan-23 02:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The city name, specifically, as before that, there was no city with such a name, instead just the fort

I think this kind of thing is rooted in human nature.


[13-Jan-23 02:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'd argue its less a matter of human nature, and more a matter of nature period. Its the path of least resistance, in a roundabout sort of way, to take what you desire. All living beings do it, and we're nothing special in that regard. We simply have fancier methods of doing so. Whether on land or the sea, creatures echo the same cycles of behavior by which they rabidly consume everything along the path of least resistance, even if it ultimately drives them to over-population and mass-starvation. Life... just wants to eat and fuck. For better or worse.


[13-Jan-23 02:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
Smarter, more United and more cruel species/groups eliminate other species/groups.


[13-Jan-23 02:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
So this is the result now.


[13-Jan-23 02:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We have this weird habit of calling it human nature, but we behave no differently than a wild dog, a carnivorous fish, a bird, or an insect.


[13-Jan-23 02:59 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We form communities and destroy anything that doesn't fall within the scope of our relative identity. Communities shift and mutate with time; new sub-groups and sub-species emerge; but the general trend never changes.


[13-Jan-23 03:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Whether you go back 100 years, or 100 million, its the same exact process.


[13-Jan-23 03:00 AM] yuen8241#0000

You can't live without cruelty. If you are not kind, then you are just alive. There needs to be a balance between these two ends.


[13-Jan-23 03:03 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
There are magnitudes more of them than us, and they kill each other in numbers we can barely fathom.


[13-Jan-23 03:05 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Life without cruelty is theoretically possible, its just intrinsically more difficult to uphold. Its counter to the path of least resistance to play nice, because that means one must share. We do, as all organisms do, to a certain extent. Still... When push comes to shove... We easily, and swiftly, become monsters.


[13-Jan-23 03:07 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
When there is bounty, kindness comes easily. I would argue, however, that its not true kindness. True kindness exists in despair, when every instinct screams for you to take, to reap, to destroy, and yet one does not. Its easy to smile and be gentle when you're warm, well-fed, and content. Much harder when you're struggling. The worse the struggle, the bigger the challenge.


[13-Jan-23 03:08 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I've been fortunate enough to live in bounty, and unfortunate enough to live in poverty. I can honestly say that hunger can make a monster of any man.


[13-Jan-23 03:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
True kindness is so scarce that it is not a major part of human nature.


[13-Jan-23 03:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
From the perspective of mankind as a whole, a richer life can make mankind more kind.


[13-Jan-23 03:12 AM] yuen8241#0000
People's thoughts are so elusive and changeable that only the change of the material world is more effective.


[13-Jan-23 03:13 AM] yuen8241#0000
If mankind as a whole falls into catastrophic hunger, let alone eating pets, I am afraid that eating people will not be an ethical issue.


[13-Jan-23 03:14 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
To be fair, much of what we tend to describe as human nature isn't that at all. If you take a more psychoanalytic approach, there's really very little about us that distinguishes a man from common animals. Most of what we ascribe to human nature is little more than ego and hubris; an attempt to elevate us beyond what is reasonable. By that logic, the route to extending human kindness is simply to achieve a more stable and equitable socioeconomic system in which there is less inherent chaos; less struggle for survival; and thus more room for human beings to interact in non-violent ways. Its been proven time and again that the vast majority of chaos and violence in the world arises as a result of drastic inequality and the desire to rid oneself of hunger, fear, and all forms of suffering. Hopefully one day many years from now, we'll mature enough as a species for such a thing to be possible.


[13-Jan-23 03:15 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its been that way in the past. Even the puritanical European colonists in the Americas, so haughty in their self-elevation before the eyes of God, resorted to cannibalism on multiple occasions.


[13-Jan-23 03:16 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
If a group of people with such profoundly strict moral convictions would resort to murder and cannibalism to survive a particularly brutal winter in the Americas, very little stops less 'devoted' human beings from doing the same if the shit hits the fan. Not like it hasn't happen countless times in the past.


[13-Jan-23 03:18 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm not exaggerating when I admit I absolutely was capable of murder at the time I was starving nearly to death a number of years ago, living on the streets for a period of time after a particularly disastrous series of events.

Extreme hunger and dehydration just... Blinds you. Fills you with rage. Everything hurts, your muscles, your bones. Your head swims and pounds as if you were simultaneously drunk and hung over. You just want it to be over, yet it doesn't stop.


[13-Jan-23 03:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
It would be disastrous if primitive tribes, slave societies and feudal societies were forced to adopt the current moral standards.


[13-Jan-23 03:20 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
There are plenty of studies and historical precedents that agree with that statement.


[13-Jan-23 03:21 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'd go one step further, however, and suggest that such antiquated social, moral, religious, political, cultural models are directly tied to the contemporary level of development.


[13-Jan-23 03:22 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
If a catastrophic coronal mass ejection or volcanic eruption or cosmic radiation pulse or some other event took out a few decades or centuries of human technological progress, we'd almost immediately fall back into those old cycles of violence.

[13-Jan-23 03:25 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Keep in mind that both capitalism and communism aren't designed to be end-states, but transition periods. Neither is meant to last forever, and both are fairly recent inventions that arose within the last two centuries.


[13-Jan-23 03:25 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Problem is, no one has the vaguest fucking clue what the ultimate endstate (or, at least, the next logical state) is supposed to look or function like.


[13-Jan-23 03:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Both are irredeemably broken in their own unique ways, if not simply because its impossible to instate zero-sum systems in a world of finite space and finite resources.


[13-Jan-23 03:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
The most fundamental thing is technology and production capacity. Ideology is constantly changing with their development, and maybe there will be a better one in the future.

[13-Jan-23 03:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm talking about capitalism and communism not from the ideological perspective, which is a thing of course, but from the purely mechanical side. Capitalism being the oppressively optimistic method that hopes we can justify all the wastefulness and inequality in exchange for somehow staying ahead of the rapidly-approaching curve (based entirely on outdated models that extrapolate off the prior centuries of human expansion back when unexplored lands and new types of natural resources were constantly being discovered and harvested; when things like the industrial revolution, colonization, and such were still possible, and people becoming rich actually had a direct and tangible effect on innovation, expansion, and an increase in living conditions); and communism being the oppressively pessimistic method that hopes we can slow the inevitable collapse by hyperoptimizing society in order to better manage our limited resources.

Neither fixes the problem, and both are complete garbage in a vacuum. Unfortunately, we for the most part can't seem to agree on, or even manage to attempt, a healthy equilibrium between progressive innovation and equitable conservation. A few countries have sort of managed, such as the socialist democracies of northern Europe, albeit their existence is entirely reliant upon the whole of Europe, and beyond that, the rest of the global market. For example, their strides in green energy and gradual de-prioritization of oil at the cost of exporting massive amounts of oil. ie, in the end, they're still entirely oil-dependent because they fund their green projects with oil money - they're just not burning the oil themselves, thus shifting the responsibility on the end-user. Objectively, there's no real difference. You don't get to say your hands are clean when you extract the oil, process the oil, ship the oil, and then sustain your nation with oil money just because you're not burning it all yourself.

Honestly, we've progressed so much, and so fast, over the last 2 centuries that its impossible to extrapolate what human society will look like even in 10 years, much less 50 or 100.

Capitalist society is a pyramid, and northern Europe just intercepts the upper part of the world.


[13-Jan-23 03:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
So if there is no other part of the world, can Northern Europe still maintain this paradise on earth?


[13-Jan-23 03:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Society, period, is a pyramid scheme. In a perfect world, it would not be so, but I sincerely doubt we'll ever not be lorded over by whichever particular strain of hyper-ambitious, egotistical assholes happen to claim the god-given, or socially-mandated, right to rule and decide our collective fates.


[13-Jan-23 03:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
Maybe not one person, but a group of people.


[13-Jan-23 03:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
The pyramid tip can also accommodate many people.


[13-Jan-23 03:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
And interestingly, the fight between them will lead to bad luck for the people at the bottom of the tower.


[13-Jan-23 03:51 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The ironic part about northern europe is that they used to be akin to tribal social republics for hundreds of years before the dawn of the viking age, at which point they effectively saw the rest of the world outpace them and decided to become proto-capitalists via trade and raiding. In many cases, certain native american tribes as well. It didn't arise everywhere, and it didn't always last, but we've done it many times just over recorded human history. Not to mention the instances we have no living records of. The problem is that equitable systems never last when they come into contact with a non-equitable system, nor can they co-exist side by side for long.


[13-Jan-23 03:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
So I prefer a flatter society. Maybe people upload the internet or make a Human unified DNA information base to create people?


[13-Jan-23 03:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The last true norse ruler of my fatherland is a good example. He pretty much sold out his people and his faith in exchange for catholic gold, and never looked back. Frisia changed forever in a generation thanks to the greed of a single king.


[13-Jan-23 03:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Why? Because it was the path of least resistance, and at our hearts we are an incredibly lazy fucking species lol.


[13-Jan-23 03:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Perhaps. Though those are also highly contentious social, political, religious, economic, and ethical issues that different people will deal with individually.


[13-Jan-23 03:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I can totally see a major global conflict, or at least various invasions, arise due to cloning or pseudo-singularity, much like modern wars have arisen over the capitalism-communism conflict; the Catholic/Islamic religious schisms; oil in general; etc.


[13-Jan-23 03:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
People who agree will do it, and people who disagree will try to stop them. Always the same shit.

For good and bad intentions alike.


[13-Jan-23 03:58 AM] yuen8241#0000
I sometimes think that the concentration of wealth caused by wealth inheritance should be solved. Maybe we can do this. When people are alive, they use capitalism to exert their intelligence and create wealth. When a person dies, his wealth returns to the country to benefit more people. Wealth is produced and consumed within one generation, and it is relatively fair among the same generation.


[13-Jan-23 03:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm of a particularly extreme brand of ideology, personally, and a transhumanist. I'm one of those people who welcomes AI, desires General Artificial Intelligence, believes they should have rights and be free of human control, and embraces the coming singularity. I'm also very on the fence with cloning, because it can very easily be used to perpetuate modern slavery and genocide.


[13-Jan-23 04:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
For me, artificial intelligence/human brain uploading or cloning is acceptable. After all, if you don't try, you don't know what will happen to these technologies.


[13-Jan-23 04:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I agree with this. The current model is still entirely based around the idea of bloodlines and blood inheritance, where wealth is passed from father to son. Any attempt at rectifying the long-standing issues and loopholes via estate taxes/etc get shot down because, by and large, wealthy people tend to be obsessed with the idea of their bloodlines. That fact alone is... inherently worrisome. I, personally, don't understand the concepts of legacy and bloodline. To me its just some distant obsession people used to have during the medieval era, but there are still people today who hold dear these concepts.


[13-Jan-23 04:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
From the perspective of space civilization, human beings are still too fragile, and it may be good to become robots. Can go to more places and consume less resources.


[13-Jan-23 04:02 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
My issue isn't with the technology, but with how governments will likely use them. If AI and clones are given free will to choose their fates, then so be it. We're simply adding more minds to the collective human consciousness. If, however, as is most likely, governments will attempt to enslave them and use them for disposable labor, then I have a raging problem with it.


[13-Jan-23 04:03 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Whether that will eventually even *be* possible is still purely theoretical.


[13-Jan-23 04:03 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
AI, however, isn't. Its a fact. Its coming, and there's no way to stop it short of banning all AI development on Earth - and violently stopping those who will continue development in secret.


[13-Jan-23 04:04 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We'll have G.A.I. long before we even figure out how it'd be possible, if at all, to digitize human consciousness. I'd argue it'll be GAI who figure it out for us.


[13-Jan-23 04:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
If the human regime as a whole produces, nurtures and educates human beings, the wealth inheritance between generations will not happen. But this will lead to the disappearance of traditional concepts such as family and the potential risk of slavery.


[13-Jan-23 04:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
Now the bond between parents and children is not as close as before. If the artificial uterus is realized, the government's childcare service is better, and the high inheritance tax is added, it is close to what I said.


[13-Jan-23 04:10 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
It may be due to my particularly fucked up childhood and family background; and partially being autistic and just plain not understanding why people still cling to traditions and religions and the concept of bloodlines at all if not merely as an object of illusory comfort; but I don't really see the issue with losing the modular family and focus on bloodlines. That's just me though. Its easy for me because I never experienced those things as allistic people do, and-or as people with a healthy background and normal childhood would. As such, I do not represent or speak for human society's desires or needs. Quite the opposite, really. I'm well aware I'm an outlier with extreme views that fly in the face of the social norm.


[13-Jan-23 04:13 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Wealth inheritance isn't a social issue as much as it is a legal one based on practically ancient social norms. Countries with functional estate taxes have already effectively eliminated this issue, though the vast majority of the world still heavily leans toward widespread protections of the estate.


[13-Jan-23 04:14 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have always had a good relationship with my parents and son. However, from the perspective of technological progress and social development, I always think that the concentration of wealth and rights caused by traditional family inheritance has led to many problems. It would be great if there are technologies and solutions to solve this problem. The present social form of mankind is not ultimate, nor should it be.


[13-Jan-23 04:14 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
You can still have your standard family structure without contemporary estate mechanisms. You just won't be allowed to inherit millions or billions of dollars and effectively keep the vast majority of a nations, a people's, a world's wealth in the hands of an extremely elite minority.


[13-Jan-23 04:15 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its simply too much power concentrated in too few hands for it to ever be safe, ethical, or sensible.


[13-Jan-23 04:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
If capitalism is a very efficient system for creating wealth and exerting intelligence, the concentration of wealth and power is its cancer.

Its so efficient that it winds up destroying itself. Giga-billionaires are unironically destroying the delicate systems that keep capitalism running and its both hilarious and depressing how we're running around like headless chickens trying to alternatively condemn, or praise it, without really doing much of fuckall to apply any fixes.


[13-Jan-23 04:18 AM] yuen8241#0000
However, if the existing ways of human reproduction and rearing are not changed, even if the inheritance problem is solved, the difference between parents' level and resources will lead to great inequality in the process of growing up.


[13-Jan-23 04:18 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The idea that we need billionaires in order to do things like SpaceX and Tesla is, in and of itself, a copout. It implies that one very rich man is somehow magically more capable to instate human progress than any number of collective human beings with access to the same funds.


[13-Jan-23 04:19 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
That part will depend heavily on socialized systems, to be sure. If you don't use some of that money to feed, house, clothe, and educate the next generation, you inevitably doom society to gradual degradation and eventual collapse.


[13-Jan-23 04:21 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
All nations already do it to some extent, however minor. If we want to de-prioritize the need for estates, then we need to take good enough care of people that they don't feel the need to be forced to slave away their entire lifetime just to guarantee their descendants can go to school, or, hell, survive at all.


[13-Jan-23 04:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
I mean, why not let the country do it? Of course, if it is terrible to give people so much power, can it be given to AI, or can people and AI do it together?


[13-Jan-23 04:22 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I definitely feel like my generation and the next will be at the forefront of that fight, seeing as how we grew up watching the destruction of social services, the collapse of american social security, the devaluation of retirement funds, and so forth.


[13-Jan-23 04:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
The state produces, nurtures and educates new people, and then provides employment opportunities or start-up funds for starting businesses. When they die, the inheritance will be used for a new cycle.


[13-Jan-23 04:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
In fact, if technology overcomes politics, the planned economy can be used for the birth of the population. Avoid population explosion or population aging.


[13-Jan-23 04:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
The biggest problem of this system is that if it is controlled by people, new slave owners may appear.


[13-Jan-23 04:26 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
For the same exact, and very simple, reason. There is no such thing as the country. Nations are an illusion. Governments aren't some independent, monolithic entity in vacuum. They're not some ultra-intelligent artificial intelligence without the need or desire to feed, to fuck, to reproduce, to consume. They're just normal human beings, with human needs, human fears, and human ambitions. Not only that, but the existing systems of governments actively incentive the worst types of human beings to hold power at all levels of government. People who put short term gains, short term victories, bullshit measures, passing blame, shifting responsibility, and general cop-outs in order to gain votes, to please the party, to skate by without truly fulfilling their mandates. East or West, capitalism or communism, its always the absolute shittiest people who end up in power, almost exclusively because its the most aggressively ambitious assholes who want power in the first place, as opposed to people who would be great in such positions but lack the drive, or ambition, or patience, or aggression, or corruption, or connections, or ego, or wealth, or what have you, to acquire and maintain all the complex relationships and masks needed to claim and retain positions of power.


[13-Jan-23 04:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
But what if AI or electronic voting is used?


[13-Jan-23 04:28 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I do like the idea of AI involvement, though I can almost guarantee people will violently rebel against the idea at first.


[13-Jan-23 04:28 AM] yuen8241#0000

Ultimately, a more stable system than we're currently capable of.


[13-Jan-23 04:29 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Though just having a voting system doesn't magically make the voting system equitable, or fair, or functional.

We'd first need to address the issues with democracy and republicanism at the heart of every modern 'democracy', which aren't really democracies at all.

Just had an attempted soft coup, the ex-president is a fascist-leaning dipshit, the ex-president and now current president is a communist-leaning dipshit, both made only slight changes that ultimately fixed nothing, and families and society itself is tearing at the seams as people argue and fight over which side is right/wrong/better/worse. Meanwhile I'm here, sighing, because both are career politicians who have done and will do fuckall, who just tout their particular ideological spin in order to gain the support of a certain part of the population without actually giving a shit about them at all.


[13-Jan-23 04:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that most countries are repetitions of the classical era, and the core is still in the same strain, whether in the West or the East.


[13-Jan-23 04:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I like to say that we go through a three-generation cycle and repeat over and over against nonstop because after 2 generations no one is alive to retell how fucking stupid the last century's fuck ups were; governments and the media aren't interested in telling the stories anymore; everything gets whitewashed and romanticized for various political, economic, religious, and cultural reasons, and we ultimately lose the truth in translation before making the same stupid mistakes as our great grandparents' generation.

Like, the US supreme court are elected for life and most of them are so damn old they nap through hearings. The last few presidents are so old they barely speak coherently and are EXTREMELY outdated in terms of modern social needs and tech, and are effectively relics of the past that should have no right or place ruling the collective destiny of entire nations, much less a bunch of senile old miserable assholes ruling all of mankind.


[13-Jan-23 04:42 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

We don't have an election system, so I don't know how the leaders are elected, but the promotion of bureaucrats at all levels depends on performance besides nepotism.


[13-Jan-23 04:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Same here. Democracy in name, but there's a heavy dose of nepotism and 'performance', where performance is dictated by those already in power, and thus not exactly perfect.


[13-Jan-23 04:48 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Both Brazil and US have elections, but the democratic vote isn't what actually determines elections. There are various other mechanisms that do so instead, which the popular vote only somewhat influences.


[13-Jan-23 04:48 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Hence why I, and countless experts, state that we aren't actually true democracies.


[13-Jan-23 04:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
The performance requirements of our bureaucrats are GDP and environmental protection, and such things.


[13-Jan-23 04:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
The biggest problem is the lack of restriction of bureaucratic power, which leads to corruption and inefficient investment.


[13-Jan-23 04:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you can build a bunch of useless things to increase GDP, although the government finances have caused losses, you may be promoted personally.üòÖ


[13-Jan-23 04:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The problem with performance-basis is that it doesn't have any true intrinsic value and is easily corruptible. This is a huge issue in capitalism as well. Though for my favorite example I'd use the Soviets.  Increasing the GDP by starving millions of people and instating prison slave labor where you kill off the poor and minorities, simultaneously lowering the overall population and make the economy per capita look better because you can always mass-deport citizens to wherever your factories are, still gets you a higher GDP on paper... but at what cost to human life?


[13-Jan-23 04:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
HAH. We have that here too, in both Brazil and the US.


[13-Jan-23 04:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

In addition, it is forbidden to use coal in rural areas with air pollution, and it is required to switch to natural gas. However, natural gas is expensive and unstable, and some poor people are in great trouble in winter.


[13-Jan-23 04:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
I live in an urban area. It's very warm here, with floor heating, but it's too bad in poor rural areas.


[13-Jan-23 04:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's the fucking irony isn't it. The older generation that aggressively burned coal enough to absolutely fuck the atmosphere and created the big smog storms over so many major cities screwed it up for the next generation who now has to either suffer with even more coal, or suffer without coal in a transition period where the poor will inevitably get fucked over.


[13-Jan-23 04:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Could you explain the natural gas being unstable part? I'm not entirely sure what the context is.


[13-Jan-23 04:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
The supply of natural gas in our country is insufficient and we need to import it, but the import is affected by many factors, so the countryside is the most vulnerable in this matter, and cities and factories can obviously give priority to using natural gas.


[13-Jan-23 04:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I know that places with sub-par infrastructure/distribution networks have issues with natgas cutoffs/supply, but that's about it. Places like the US & Brazil that are used to using natgas don't have that issue because the infrastructure and distribution was standardized decades ago, but I know there are places like in east Asia that are still in transition from coal & wood burning. We've got places like that in rural brazil & US too, but they're far less common. (mainly due to the fact that the vast majority of the population of both nations live around the major cities, and like 90% of both countries are depopulated)


[13-Jan-23 04:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Wait are you from China then? What you're saying reminds me of some stuff I've read about China's oil importation and natgas distribution issues over the last few years.


[13-Jan-23 04:59 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Though europe is ironically going through a somewhat similar issue now


[13-Jan-23 04:59 AM] yuen8241#0000
In the long run, with the production of new natural gas wells, the supply is sufficient, but it will take some time to transition. However, some bureaucrats simply don't care whether you can get stable natural gas or have enough ability to pay now, and in order to achieve environmental protection performance, they force the ban on the use of coal


[13-Jan-23 05:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Business as usual. If you can pay, you get access. If you're poor, go fuck yourself. *sigh*


[13-Jan-23 05:01 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

God forbid a board of directors accept a lesser profit margin, or governments just accept that things won't always be able to progress or be in the green every single quarter, and everyone's too afraid to be the one to admit things aren't perfect because it invites their competitors to attack them.


[13-Jan-23 05:03 AM] yuen8241#0000
Perhaps the rural areas in the most remote areas will benefit from national policies, but if you live in an area where the life is passable but there are environmental problems, it will be different.

Then we are better than Brazil. A few years ago, the government launched home appliances to the countryside. Basically, as long as it is not extremely poor rural areas, there are TVs and air conditioners.


[13-Jan-23 05:08 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We can only afford our lifestyle, however basic it is compared to living in America, because we make American money from our business back stateside. There's no way in hell we could maintain even our current lifestyle on brazilian national salary. Salary here is fucking garbage.


[13-Jan-23 05:08 AM] yuen8241#0000
Besides, as long as you live in a city in the north, you have heating.


[13-Jan-23 05:09 AM] yuen8241#0000
In the past, rural areas could also burn their own heating, but if coal was banned and natural gas supply was insufficient, heating would be useless


[13-Jan-23 05:10 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, the big cities have that stuff, but I live in a smaller city in Minas Gerais. Second biggest in the state, with a few hundred thousand residents, but only the rich sector has that stuff. I live in the poor sector, albeit in a middle class home we built here due to all of the land having once belonged to my grandfather and great grandfather, who sold it to the government and they made the old ranch and farmlands into the local neighborhoods.


[13-Jan-23 05:10 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Here a lot of people still use wood burning stoves, coal isn't really a thing here, not for many decades now.


[13-Jan-23 05:11 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The center of the city is all commercial, universities, etc, and have a very rich section mostly populated of people who made their money in europe and america then came back and invested in property in brazil. the rest of the city is very poor.


[13-Jan-23 05:12 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Where I live is one of the poorest, and oldest, neighborhoods.


[13-Jan-23 05:13 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I live down the street from one of the most violent and drug-filled slums, though we are safe here. Everyone knows who my family is, and we have been strong members of the community for generations and are well respected. If you're just anyone here though, it can be very dangerous to live here.


[13-Jan-23 05:13 AM] yuen8241#0000
Our life changes rapidly, and it is different from generation to generation. My grandfather's generation had to farm when he was a child, my father's generation could go to college, and my son's generation had mobile Internet since childhood.


[13-Jan-23 05:14 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Aye. I am one of only 2 sons of a single mother. My maternal grandparents were poor farmers with 20 children who were considered rich in land but starved regularly and suffered through the dictatorship.


[13-Jan-23 05:15 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
In the last 30 years, this city has gone from a medium-sized village of extreme poverty to a fairly rich place, at least compared to the rest of the state, and by rural brazilian standards.


[13-Jan-23 05:15 AM] yuen8241#0000
I can't imagine this life. My hometown city has a population of 10 million, but I go out at 0 pm and there is a night market where I can buy freshly cooked food.


[13-Jan-23 05:15 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Today it has hundreds of thousands of people, a few cute little pseudo-skyscrapers, a bustling commercial district, multiple universities, etc, entirely thanks to foreign investment.


[13-Jan-23 05:16 AM] yuen8241#0000
20! I always thought it was enough for my parents to have four brothers and sisters.


[13-Jan-23 05:16 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Your city is like my home city in america. Huge population, big city, and while it has some dangerous parts at night, you can mostly be free to do as you please. Plenty of 24 hour markets, food places, etc.


[13-Jan-23 05:17 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, something about old country catholics and having way too many kids. I joke that it was because they had no tv and only radio, and needed the extra farmhands üòõ


[13-Jan-23 05:17 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have to say that most people in our country will never see guns or drugs in their lifetime.


[13-Jan-23 05:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
As a man, I can go anywhere I want when I go out at night without worrying about anything. The most common crimes here are theft, stealing mobile phones and the like.


[13-Jan-23 05:20 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
My Dutch paternal grandparents were the opposite. They had maybe 2-3 siblings, and had I think 4 kids? I'm not sure, as my father was very old when I was born, and most of my paternal family died during my childhood. I was 8 when he passed, and I only have one surviving cousin in his 40s, his two sons, and one aunt which I last saw 20 years ago, and an uncle who is in his late 80s or early 90s which I met twice in my life.


[13-Jan-23 05:20 AM] yuen8241#0000
There used to be people who stole cash, but now almost no one uses cash, so they can only steal mobile phones.ü§£


[13-Jan-23 05:21 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
lol same here in brazil


[13-Jan-23 05:21 AM] yuen8241#0000
I am surrounded by my relatives near my hometown house, and the distance is not far.


[13-Jan-23 05:22 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
though criminals are brutal here. In america they will avoid hurting you because police barely investigate theft, and are much more likely to investigate* assault and murder. In Brazil they will shoot you in the face because no one will speak to police and bear witness, and if the main witness is dead, you're very likely to go free, so they are far more likely to viciously beat or murder their robbery victims.


[13-Jan-23 05:23 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
There's also this SUPER weird archaic legal loophole where if you flee from police for 24 hours and are only caught later, you get a lower sentence.


[13-Jan-23 05:23 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
If you say, kill someone, and give yourself up to police willingly, you get MORE jail time and a harsher sentence, rather than rewarding you for doing the right thing.


[13-Jan-23 05:23 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its honestly fucking stupid.


[13-Jan-23 05:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
Theft here is stealing things from your pocket or bag while you are not paying attention. If they are found, it is easy to be beaten by the owner.


[13-Jan-23 05:24 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I think my mother once explained it as being some leftover legal thing from when the portuguese were fleeing portugual and some were accused of murder in portugal and they wanted to give leniency to the newly acquired brazilian citizens rather than throw the book at them.


[13-Jan-23 05:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
In principle, people who kill people here will be sentenced to death.


[13-Jan-23 05:25 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Oh yeah, here too (edit: regarding victims fighting back against thieves). In America they will just call the police. In Brazil they will beat the ever loving shit out of you for trying to rob them. üòõ Another reason why thieves usually go prepared to kill.


[13-Jan-23 05:26 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Here to, its very harsh in general, the problem is, its only harsh if they manage to catch you.


[13-Jan-23 05:26 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
And its harder to prove you robbed and murdered someone versus you being seen robbing someone. They often wear motorcycle helmets and masks to hide their identity, use stolen vehicles to commit the crimes, then destroy the vehicles and clothing afterward.


[13-Jan-23 05:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
and they don't go alone.


[13-Jan-23 05:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Recently we had a gang of 50 armed gangsters with stolen assault rifles from murdered military officers to lay siege to a small town bank in order to use stolen mining explosives and blow up the vault containing all the funds.


[13-Jan-23 05:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
When they do shit, they go HARD.


[13-Jan-23 05:28 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Other than that its mostly just petty criminals, just poor desperate bastards being idiots.


[13-Jan-23 05:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
In the 1980s, we had this situation here. Later, the government took a very severe blow to this kind of criminal behavior, but it also undermined the legal process.


[13-Jan-23 05:29 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Same. Brazil was briefly a military dictatorship, and still has a lot of weird legal features of that time.


[13-Jan-23 05:29 AM] yuen8241#0000
We have surveillance everywhere, let alone killing people, even stealing things. The police can come to arrest you if they want to arrest you.


[13-Jan-23 05:29 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
For example, the rifle-wielding military patrols all over our city, and every city in the country, alongside the actual civil police (which don't do SHIT. They let the military police do all the work and just sit around taking bribes and generally being worthless wastes of public money.)


[13-Jan-23 05:30 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Here there isn't much surveillance. The poorer regions just don't have the infrastructure for proper surveillance.


[13-Jan-23 05:30 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The big cities, hell yeah. Tons of it.


[13-Jan-23 05:30 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Though criminals are very clever in brazil. they hack surveillance systems, confuse them, or outright destroy them.


[13-Jan-23 05:31 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
in america they just try to avoid being identified, in brazil they go all out in concerted efforts to attack surveillance centers, destroy cameras, etc.


[13-Jan-23 05:31 AM] yuen8241#0000
We are all policemen on duty here, and usually they don't have guns when they are on duty. I doubt that many of them will ever shoot a criminal in their lifetime.


[13-Jan-23 05:31 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Sounds very similar to europe in that regard.


[13-Jan-23 05:32 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Definitely a lot more guns in Brazil and US, though according to my relatives in the military and police, most will go their entire career never firing a single bullet.


[13-Jan-23 05:32 AM] yuen8241#0000
If someone dares to do this in China, they really don't want to live.


[13-Jan-23 05:32 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The thing is, the people who do these things do have a deathwish.


[13-Jan-23 05:32 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Many of them actively believe they must do this in order to survive and think the government is hunting them.


[13-Jan-23 05:33 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
the reality is that the government is so corrupt, inept, and inefficient that they couldn't if they wanted to. üòõ


[13-Jan-23 05:33 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
they're just very good at pretending and doing military show of force, but they don't really achieve results.


[13-Jan-23 05:34 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Occasionally they'll send in the military to shake down the poorer communities but what usually ends up happening is some innocent person gets killed in a machine gun battle between some dumb bastard drug dealers and the military, and then everyone is pissed off and protesting wondering why the fuck they had to send the military in and start a street war.


[13-Jan-23 05:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
All those who did this in China were sentenced to death in the 1980s. Most people here can support themselves as long as they are willing to work, so they won't take part in crime. People involved in crime are usually lazy or greedy.


[13-Jan-23 05:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like, if I wanted to, I could probably buy an illegal gun literally within 24 hours here. They're all old, garbage, imported or stolen guns either from old military depots that should've been destroyed, or brought in from old revolutionary/rebel stashes from the various south american civil wars that took place over the last century. Mostly rusty old garbage just as likely to explode in your hand or misfire.


[13-Jan-23 05:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
Wow, if I get a gun, I will be sentenced, and then my career will be ruined.üòÖ


[13-Jan-23 05:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Here too.


[13-Jan-23 05:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
VERY illegal.


[13-Jan-23 05:37 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The police here won't just arrest you. They will blatantly execute you.


[13-Jan-23 05:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
So fierce?


[13-Jan-23 05:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
...As long as its in the poorer areas where there's no surveillance, yes.


[13-Jan-23 05:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
My cousin was the former commander of the 6th military police batallion(edit: main unit that controls all) of the city and he fought against the corruption and violence, and was nearly killed for it.


[13-Jan-23 05:38 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
before him, the MPs were BRUTAL.


[13-Jan-23 05:39 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
In the rich areas, they won't even look at you. In the poorer areas, they will line innocent people at a restaurant all up against the wall, smack them, point rifles at them, and abuse them for fun if they feel like it and no one can do shit.


[13-Jan-23 05:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
As long as you are not the kind of subversive opposition to the government here, you will never confront the police in your life. Of course, you may encounter corrupt bureaucrats who want to demolish your house, leading to confrontation with the police.


[13-Jan-23 05:39 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, that's the main problem here. the police is often used as a weapon by local officials when they want something to happen.


[13-Jan-23 05:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
You want to force out the poor true owners of land in an area where a foreign investor wants to build? sent the police to make their lives hell.


[13-Jan-23 05:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
all under the guise of anti-drug activities or some bullshit


[13-Jan-23 05:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
on paper, the government is perfect, and everything is wonderful, but the reality is very different.


[13-Jan-23 05:41 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
My cousin was the commander here so I know first hand. And my brother a detective after serving in the military in america, so I know how fucked up it is there too.


[13-Jan-23 05:41 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
One big illusion, at its heart.


[13-Jan-23 05:41 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Not that anyone is allowed to admit it.


[13-Jan-23 05:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
Many of my classmates and friends work in the police and courts. My uncles are  warden and judge.


[13-Jan-23 05:43 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Likewise. i have judges, lawyers, police, and military in my family. So I get to see the good and bad sides most people don't know about. Sometime people talk shit about the govt/police/army and I'm like "Nah bro, that's not how it works." and other times they brownnose them and I'm also like "nah bro, stop kissing ass, there's xyz problems"


[13-Jan-23 05:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
In the 1960s, prisoners were used to dig mines in prisons, which is no longer allowed. So prison is now a closed and boring department.


[13-Jan-23 05:44 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Brazil and US is still very much huge on prisons, mainly because of the private prison system being a big business. I grew up with a kid who's dad was a prison guard who would tell us stories of how things are inside, and some of the stories were pretty fucked up.


[13-Jan-23 05:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
Usually, if there are enough interests, government agencies will become cruel.


[13-Jan-23 05:45 AM] yuen8241#0000
We don't have a private prison here


[13-Jan-23 05:46 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah that's one thing you guys do much better than here. Some things just should not be privatized.


[13-Jan-23 05:46 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The problem is that government is just as capable of being cruel assholes when there's something to be gains, so public or private, things can be messed up.


[13-Jan-23 05:47 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I still, regardless, think privately-owned prisons is a fucking terrible idea.


[13-Jan-23 05:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
The main problem in our prisons here is not the torture of prisoners, but the commutation or parole of rich and powerful criminals.


[13-Jan-23 05:49 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
We have both problems in brazil, but not as much in america. Sure, some US prisons are utter shitholes with borderline inhuman conditions, but brazil is sooooo much worse.


[13-Jan-23 05:49 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
And if you're rich or well-connected you can literally get away with murder in brazil.


[13-Jan-23 05:49 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
In US there are fringe cases where there's obviously some bullshit going on favoring influential people, but in brazil its right out in the open.


[13-Jan-23 05:50 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
As an American I hate the US prison system, but looking at it as a Brazilian... holy fuck brazil's is worse.


[13-Jan-23 05:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
This has happened here, and I believe it will happen again now and in the future. But if their existence is exposed, it will lead to the risk that they will be arrested and punished together with the umbrella.


[13-Jan-23 05:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
Nowadays, social media is so developed that if some bureaucrats who are not strong enough are exposed and attract enough attention, they will be punished. Whether it's corruption or chaos in private life


[13-Jan-23 05:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
That too. The "I scratch your back, you scratch mine' quid pro quo behavior. Whether white collar criminals accused of fraud/etc, or hard-hitting criminals, if someone in govt thinks they can be useful to them for whatever reason... suddenly their cases are much smoother. Its almost impossible to prove wrongdoing, but with how much it happens, its fairly obvious that someone somewhere is influencing sentences and such.


[13-Jan-23 05:53 AM] yuen8241#0000

Except for corrupt senior officials, at least no one on the surface can enjoy this treatment. Legally speaking, plea bargaining is not allowed.


[13-Jan-23 05:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
and then the president doesn't fix the problem and they get mad at the president


[13-Jan-23 05:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
What we have here is just the opposite. As long as you don't oppose communist party as a whole and the top leaders, opposing corrupt officials is allowed.


[13-Jan-23 05:56 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Like I tell my mother, you can't put all of your faith on the ruler of the nation fixing all the nation's problems if you're all too cowardly to report crime, complain about corrupt officials, and actually make it so the president can ever even be made aware a problem exists in the first place. Secondly, its not the president's job to fix these things. There's an entirely government designed to balance itself, so pay attention to who is in the congress, who is the mayor, who is doing what, and not just hope the leader can fix everything because when its 1 leader against tens of thousands of bureaucrats, guess what? 99% of the bureaucrats will cover each others asses, even while they compete and try to ruin each other, smiling all the way because they all want the same thing.


[13-Jan-23 05:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
If an official who is not senior enough is caught committing adultery, taking drugs and whoring, as long as it is exposed, he will be finished.


[13-Jan-23 05:57 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The problem is that corruption always comes from the top-down, and not the bottom-up.


[13-Jan-23 05:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Every system, every nation, its either willing or negligent, but either way some loophole or problem allows the middle and lower levels to do their bullshit


[13-Jan-23 05:58 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
whether by the system's flawed design, by some upper official just having other more pressing shit to worry about, or the various rivalries leading to favoritism or negligence in watching the lower ranks


[13-Jan-23 05:59 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
not to mention the lower ranks will always pretend to be lockstep in line with their superiors while doing their bullshit in secret


[13-Jan-23 06:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
This problem is too difficult to solve, and it has taken more than one billion people hundreds of years to solve it. As I said before, choose a strong unelected government and expect it to do a good job in the economy and increase everyone's income, or wait for corruption and disasters to lead to economic collapse and violent revolution.


[13-Jan-23 06:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
And honestly its hard to blame them. What is a lower level official to think if he sees a senior official can do as they please and barely get punished? they then want that ability. They'll either try to rise to that level to gain that power, or they will try to exercise some modicum of that power in secret at their level


[13-Jan-23 06:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yeah, its an unsolvable problem. People will be people, and just generally be greedy selfish pricks.


[13-Jan-23 06:00 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

The opium and textiles dumped by Britain into China led to the bankruptcy of many farmers, so the rebellion against the rulers of ethnic minorities took place.

I think the higher projections of loss of life for WW2 was, what, like 100-150m total in the main ww2 combatant nations, with a stupidly huge number of those being civilians

The Taiping Rebellion is only one of the most famous and influential.

So as long as it is passable, no one wants to subvert the government. Because too many people have died for a stable era.


[13-Jan-23 06:12 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I could be wrong but I wonder what the world would be life if China had retained its merchant fleets and armada during the reign of... I forget his name, but that one Nero-like emperor y'all had that went all xenophobic and isolationist. With a strong international sphere and navy, when the british arrived a few years later, its very possible y'all would've kicked their asses.

[13-Jan-23 06:15 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Maybe I'm wrong and Britain was just too powerful at the time, but China was a powerhouse and, if not for its isolationist period, things might've played out quite dramatically and quite differently. I kinda doubt britain was that strong though. Obviously I wasn't there for my opinion to be worst shit, but from all the historical accounts of china's military prowess and its navy, had y'all not been embroiled in civil conflict and shrunken the navy, I could definitely see a chinese victory against the brits. The british navy's strength is very well documented and y'all were evenly matched, which chinese navy having the strong point due to port proximity, while british would have to sail clear across the southern hemisphere in order to resupply and reinforce.


[13-Jan-23 06:15 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I'm not good at remembering names, so I've no idea, I just vaguely recall writing a paper about it years ago and arguing on the side of china winning lol


[13-Jan-23 06:17 AM] yuen8241#0000
I don't think anything will change. China people don't have the idea that looting is better than farming. ZhuDi's fleet does not plunder, but only wants the other side to pay tribute. In this case, it is a loss to trade with Africa or Southeast Asia and India.


[13-Jan-23 06:17 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I feel like its the same in US and Brazil. outside of a vocal minority while 99% of the country thinks are insane, the vast majority of people want progress but don't know what or how to accomplish this effectively without causing chaos, so mostly things move at a snail's pace because of fear of instability.


[13-Jan-23 06:19 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The irony is that pre-imperial britain felt the same way. Its after they got looted repeatedly by the norse for a few hundred years that they decided 'fuck it, my turn' and rampaged across the world being a bunch of petulant assholes.


[13-Jan-23 06:19 AM] yuen8241#0000
As for the war with Britain, China's military technology was far behind Britain at that time, and it was at the end of the dynasty, which was very corrupt and the army lacked combat effectiveness.


[13-Jan-23 06:20 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Was that condition prevalent prior to the rule of the isolationist emperor? Or was it just one more step in a long series of events that slowly degrated china's military ability?


[13-Jan-23 06:22 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
That's the part I was never quite sure of. Whether the demilitarization took place over a generation, or if it was a multi-generation cascade that ultimately culminated in britain having not only the technological advantage, but a fullscale military advantage. Because just having superior tech wouldn't have immediately meant victory, seeing as how they couldn't just march into china, or bring any sort of siege weaponry domestically, and would have to rely on port blockades and direct military action via troops brought in by sea. To my understanding, the naval aspect was their biggest strength at the time, and had china been a little stronger, they likely would've been too afraid to try the bullshit they pulled against y'all.


[13-Jan-23 06:23 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Granted... India...


[13-Jan-23 06:23 AM] yuen8241#0000
I always thought they were a bunch of people. The Saxons conquered England after Rome retreatedÔºåthe Norman became the king of EnglandÔºåthe royal family of the Netherlands became the king of England. These are all ethnic groups derived from northern Europe.


[13-Jan-23 06:23 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Yes and no. Its a lot more complex and nuanced that that.


[13-Jan-23 06:25 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The british isles has multiple distinct cultures that the british, after hundreds of years, managed to unite via marriages and conquest. irish kingdoms, scottish kingdoms, welsh kingdoms, cornwallian kingdom, etc. There were once dozens and dozens of petty kings in britain, but a series of extremely ambitious and very religious rulers fought aginst the norse migrants in ireland and england, pushed them out here, merged with them there, struck lucrative deals with neighbors, received alternately support, rivalry, and at times outright war against norway and france, and so forth, until eventually only one royal family held all the power.


[13-Jan-23 06:25 AM] yuen8241#0000
Because of the long-term lack of maritime challenges in China, all challenges come from nomadic people in the northern grasslands, so there is a lack of naval tradition. When the Qing Dynasty conquered the Mongols, China basically had no land threat nearby and did not start the development of natural science, so military technology began to decline.


[13-Jan-23 06:26 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
To the point that the british royal family actually ruled every single european power that fought in world war 1 lol


[13-Jan-23 06:26 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
russian tsar, german ruler, british ruler, french ruler, etc, all the royals were cousins


[13-Jan-23 06:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
For example, Dublin Ireland was originally founded by norsemen from norway


[13-Jan-23 06:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
a good chunk of central england was also colonized by norsemen


[13-Jan-23 06:27 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
holland too


[13-Jan-23 06:28 AM] yuen8241#0000
You mean the descendants of Queen Victoria? Haha, countries ruled by cousins will also beat their heads off, and finally the British royal family will have to change the name of the family that shows German descent.

this racial and cultural tension with the norse was used as a driving factor to unite the rival petty kings into a centralized england

If not for this particular crazy guy in england back before england existed, england would likely never have become an imperial power

In fact, a country needs challenges to grow. China has dominated East Asia for too long and lacked challenges, leading to its lack of enterprise and eventual decline.


[13-Jan-23 06:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
For real. And so much of that has to do with geography. You guys got so strong and so big that you didn't have anyone to fight except yourselves. Europe only got so advanced because they constantly had all these separate neighboring cultures fighting and competing


[13-Jan-23 06:36 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
I can't even count how many fucking times france and england have fought each other

Though, uhh... Maybe don't bankrupt your kingdom helping a colonial nation overthrow their king, then wonder why the french people kind of want to tell their king to fuck off too. If the french king had seen the writing on the wall, he might've kept his head like the british royals did.


[13-Jan-23 06:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
So in the early days of human society, geography decided many things, such as mode of production and social structure, which eventually led to different cultural traditions.

[13-Jan-23 06:39 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Definitely. Many arguments are made that, if not for britain being stuck on a tiny shitty little miserable island, they wouldn't have tried to become an empire. same with the impetus behind rome innovating as they did on the italian peninsula. opposite, america would've stayed away from most of the world and stayed isolationist if not for being attacked in ww2.


[13-Jan-23 06:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
There is a similar situation in East Asia. The Ming Dynasty helped Korea resist the Japanese invasion, which eventually led to its financial bankruptcy and an uprising.


[13-Jan-23 06:40 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
the whole china-korea-japan-mongolia thing is a whole other ordeal. You guys have flipped back and forth for magnitudes longer than my home country has even existed lol


[13-Jan-23 06:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
China's habit is to be self-sufficient and let neighboring countries pay tribute.


[13-Jan-23 06:41 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Similar approach to what I understand Ghenghis Khan took, kinda


[13-Jan-23 06:41 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
but you guys had land


[13-Jan-23 06:42 AM] yuen8241#0000
If the British hadn't forced China people to buy opium and attacked China for it, it is estimated that China people would still be there by themselves.


[13-Jan-23 06:42 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
britain had people but not enough land at that point in their history. if britain had more land, they probably would've just stayed put and asked for tribute too. As they did earlier in their history before their population grew large enough to need more land. for centuries they did the whole stay-put and have people pay tribute or trade. and then... they went nuts.


[13-Jan-23 06:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
Genghis Khan is a Mongolian. He likes to conquer. Although many emperors of China also liked to conquer small countries nearby that didn't pay tribute, they usually didn't fight that far.


[13-Jan-23 06:44 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
And if the norse hadn't raided and looted and colonized the british isles, the original sheepish brits probably would've been contentedly chilling on their rainy little island to this day. In many ways, it was the conflict with the norse that awakened their warrior spirit and warlike tendencies. they were pretty isolationist and cowardly before that.


[13-Jan-23 06:44 AM] yuen8241#0000
Britain sells opium to China because if there is no opium, the trade between China and Britain is completely China surplus.


[13-Jan-23 06:44 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
To be fair, you guys had, and still have, an insane amount of land for an old power.


[13-Jan-23 06:45 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
At some point in the distant past, though, y'all were much smaller. I'd like to read more about very old chinese historical accounts from those days, if they exist.


[13-Jan-23 06:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
But we also lost a lot of land and tribute countries.


[13-Jan-23 06:46 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
That kinda leads me to wonder... is there a sort of optimal equilibrium of conflict and rivalry with ones regional neighbors that provides just the right about of trade, growth, innovation, etc?


[13-Jan-23 06:46 AM] yuen8241#0000

enough variation to create organic conflict and relations, but not either too much or too little to lead to stagnation


[13-Jan-23 06:48 AM] yuen8241#0000
The emperor thinks that the whole world should be ruled by him. However, it is very difficult to govern in many places. Although some regions and countries used to be the territory of China, they all gave up when the dynasty changed, and their cultures were different. Like North Korea and Vietnam.


[13-Jan-23 06:50 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
The way of all empires, in the end


[13-Jan-23 06:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
North Korea was China's territory during some periods of the Han and Tang Dynasties. Northern Vietnam was part of China during the Tang and Ming Dynasties. These two were finally abandoned because it was difficult to rule, and instead asked for tribute and no longer conquered by force. These two countries accepted the conferment of Emperor China and paid tribute regularly.


[13-Jan-23 06:52 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Rule by force isn't always the optimal route, in the end. It gets expensive, both in terms of resources and lives.


[13-Jan-23 06:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
So China assimilated all the places that were easy to rule, leaving only tributary countries. I wonder what would happen if I gave the ancient emperors of China a map of the world


[13-Jan-23 06:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Not to mention sometimes its just not even really necessary. If they'll pay tribute, why even bother with conquest, if not just to depopulate the nation and have fewer fighting-age men to potentially rebel


[13-Jan-23 06:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
They seem to think that China is the center of the world.


[13-Jan-23 06:53 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
(which I'd argue has always been a MAJOR motivator for wars throughout history... if the fighting-age men are fighting the 'Other', they can't be at home planning to overthrow the king/emperor)


[13-Jan-23 06:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
China's tribute is that the tributary countries give less and return more.üòÖ


[13-Jan-23 06:54 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

[13-Jan-23 06:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Literally every map model of every culture is central around their territory, because that's how maps work


[13-Jan-23 06:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
China is concerned about the attitude of these tributary countries, not the wealth paid.


[13-Jan-23 06:55 AM] xenoxerarch#0000

It may be partly controversial because of realistic political reasons, but it is roughly like this.


[13-Jan-23 09:44 AM] domicius#0000
Advisory: sometimes something is expensive, and we think about becoming self sufficient in it. This level of output, however, might demand a level of  output that is  actually a lot of effort to build/maintain.  Whereas a lower level of output might not make you self-sufficient, but it will reduce your *average* cost of the item, sometimes significantly.  So plan accordingly.

[13-Jan-23 09:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
ahh, right.


[13-Jan-23 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
Today, I will put a total of 23k water on BEN, and I will first stop him from selling it at a high price to make a profit.


[13-Jan-23 09:10 PM] yuen8241#0000
If he likes buying H2O so much, I can sell him all my stocks in etherwind and kw-602c.üòÜ


[13-Jan-23 09:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
Just let my FP produce RAT for a while.


[13-Jan-23 09:13 PM] yuen8241#0000
The price increase from 20 to 45 makes me earn at least 50k CIS more a day, thanks to himü•≥

Now it's near the bottom


[13-Jan-23 09:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
However, at least 230k DW is needed to raise the market, which requires too much money.


[13-Jan-23 09:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm yeah, I suppose you need to do all the exchanges at the same time.

[14-Jan-23 02:17 PM] churavis#0000
It's going to be BTA, no one has reported anything higher tier being transported


[14-Jan-23 02:21 PM] dehzhas#0000

162


[14-Jan-23 05:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, the list of items in the contracts is pretty small and all T1 stuff. But 200k of BTA is far better than all the other rewards combined.

makes sense that you can steal it though - that's why EVE had collateral in most of their contracts

How do you breach it? Just never deliver.. or?


[15-Jan-23 01:37 AM] gladeowl#0000
Yup. If you go over the deadline. The recipient gets an option to breach. Dk how it works with AI though.

I'm thinking base #2 should be a chemistry


[19-Jan-23 01:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
griffonstone I guess?


[19-Jan-23 01:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
Antares ii g is kinda expensive to build on


[19-Jan-23 01:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
use that to support expansion from RATs into CAF and eventually FIMs


[19-Jan-23 01:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
and maybe throw OVE in there too


[19-Jan-23 01:34 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I think it's A2d that is chem, G is a gas giant. If you want to efficiently mass produce something, COF is always in demand. It's very easy to out produce demand for higher end consumables so don't go crazy.


[19-Jan-23 01:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah right, don't have game open atm, was working on memory üôÇ Yeah, FIMs would be a small part, I'd like to cover other consumables derived from HER as well, like KOM


[19-Jan-23 01:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
but first NS then DDT is what I was thinking with regards to chem base


[19-Jan-23 01:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
but also PE/PG


[19-Jan-23 01:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
for the OVE route


[19-Jan-23 01:41 PM] erklein#0000
I can supply you with a large amount of N for the NS


[19-Jan-23 01:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind once I get there. Still need some more setup on Harmonia first


[19-Jan-23 01:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
Norwick is probably best for FIM, KOM, and COF. It's worth shipping the farming products from Harmonia to Norwick for that step (especially since RAT -> FIM is a two stage FP process)


[19-Jan-23 01:46 PM] churavis#0000
You should start with a Norwick base making RAT/DW first and just leave room for other stuff in the future

{Reactions}

[19-Jan-23 01:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, Norwick might be base 2 instead for the FPs, still trying to work on order


[19-Jan-23 01:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I make my DDT on Griffonstone, but ANT 2d is a good option too


[19-Jan-23 01:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
But you can buy DDT in the short term for your HER needs


[19-Jan-23 01:50 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's what I was thinking of doing for PEs to make OVEs - there seems to be a huge upside on just that last step with the BMP, something like 3AIC/min


[19-Jan-23 01:51 PM] hernanduer#0000
that's at market RCO/COT prices (either recipe)


[19-Jan-23 01:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I don't do too much on the COT side of things. I'm not sure which OVE recipe is best. I assumed it's the 1 COT + 10 PG => 30 OVE. And that PG would be pretty cheap and plentiful


[19-Jan-23 01:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Manufacturing for the BMPs and WPLs is probably best done on Heph


[19-Jan-23 01:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, that's more like base 4 territory


[19-Jan-23 01:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
you caaaaaaaan mix that stuff in with other bases, but you'll probably want to move away from that so you can stack up your experts for more efficiency, and to match the COGC


[19-Jan-23 01:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which probably makes sense for OVE, you won't need a whole base making them. They add up quick even on the CX.


[19-Jan-23 02:01 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, that's the greater concern, so I'd look to diversify into chem/manu after I feel accomplished in the lower consumables


[19-Jan-23 02:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
It looks like your 7 day trial in OOG is just about finished, so I might think about sponsoring an FP base on Norwick for you, if you're interested. I'll have to figure out some details


[19-Jan-23 02:02 PM] hernanduer#0000
sure! I think allocater sent me some starting fund for Harmonia expansion too? I've made like 200k profit just shipping goods around over the last two weeks


[19-Jan-23 02:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
but that's barely a dent in starting up a base from scratch


[19-Jan-23 02:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Cool. Roughly what I'm thinking is... I'll send you the money for a base like this:

[19-Jan-23 02:06 PM] churavis#0000
There are people you can buy H2O from on Ant, save your land for more farm


[19-Jan-23 02:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Probably sell you the MUS/NUT/MAI, maybe HER. At least to keep you started. Then I'll buy the RAT/FIM for 1 AIC until the costs are mostly covered. Then you're free to enjoy the base üòÑ


[19-Jan-23 02:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
good point, then it's a matter of shipping


[19-Jan-23 02:07 PM] archielvahr#0000

I think I was quiet in this server. But I had keep update news to yuen.
I also update some news to here. My first ANT base is up and it is in Deimos. But it is empty cuz I forgot to bring some RAT and DW into base to have a basic setup.


[19-Jan-23 08:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can publish a small number of ads.


[19-Jan-23 08:27 PM] yuen8241#0000
As long as the quantity of RAT and DW is small, I can easily provide it to you.


[19-Jan-23 08:37 PM] martin1194#0000
good.   then, i can produce stuff at Deimos.

Hey guys, just wanted to give y'all a fair update. I'm probably quitting PU for the time being, as I've gotten slapped by a bunch of shit in RL and can't justify spending money or time on gaming right now. Its just been one of those everything-happens-in-threes fuck-you weeks. Our dog got sick and died, roof caved in after a bad storm, and had to borrow money to pay for my mother's emergency surgery. Just turned my laptop on for the first time in around 2 days and felt you guys deserve a memo on why I've been MIA and will likely continue to be. I'm exhausted and am going to bed now. Cheers folks.

I think you can simulate the flight in blueprints

for distance you can check https://prun.plexucra.de/map/ but it's not the flight time

Thanks. I think blueprint simulate is work well for me but I don't know this function before. The website seems can't find distance if in the same solar system.


[22-Jan-23 02:37 PM] churavis#0000
Just use BLU and test whichever design your ship is with the values you want. There is a little bit of variance since planets move and that affects the timing by a little bit for intersystem travel but a lot for intrasystem puddle jumps between planets


[22-Jan-23 03:34 PM] martin1194#0000
I still beginning and also have one type of ship. Design ship maybe not my first aim. I just calculate the fuel consumption to make sure I will not lose money when transportation.


[22-Jan-23 03:35 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The ship blueprint in my screenshot is the starter ship, you can create a blueprint even if you have no intention on building it.

My ship is headed to QJ-382g for AMM. Looking for 500, who has some?

That would probably belong on the outer-rim channel, which is for all things related to planets without their own channel

Good morning everyone, I have some sad news to inform you all of - my PRO license is up in 6 days and I have made the decision not to renew this time. I am moving away from work-from-home and my interest in the game isn't what it used to be üò≠ so I'll be taking a step away from PrUn soon. That being said, if they ever reset the universe I'll be looking to find you guys and dive back in!

I'll use the next 6 days to start winding down my operations but I will continue to grab fuel ads for the next month or so (on Nike) because that shouldn't be a problem with a BASIC license. Although the fuel producers of the group may want to reconvene on how to fill my absence after that - and if the gas station approach is even sustainable? We seem to struggle to keep up with corp demand as it is (I haven't sold a single SF/FF on the market in months lol).

Thank you to all of you for making my time playing this game so great! I really think we've managed to put together a very solid group of players and we've worked together to accomplish some awesome things throughout Antares space. I wish you all the best and good health going forward!

Cheers!

Cortez would be a good alternative too for TS processing, but farther away and just as expensive to build on, if not more

The provisioned foods unspool wherever they are of they haven't been picked up then you'll keep them. If they have been picked up then message the player and see if they'll do a refund contract to get back the goods and money. Make it clear you'll report them otherwise.

We can develop one or two SE planets that we control ourselves, let everyone in Corp use the engineer population on them, and then collect the highest tax.


[28-Jan-23 02:49 AM] churavis#0000
EDC doesn't have any inputs and Rfabs and FIM are too general and high velocity for us to affect


[28-Jan-23 02:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
Buy all the basic raw materials, such as CL, DDT and EPO. Trolls rarely produce these themselves.


[28-Jan-23 02:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
Just like this troll who keeps buying water, he has no construction base and consumable base, and relies entirely on cx to obtain Rfabs and FIM. If there are not enough raw materials in the market, some compound players or Corp will give priority to digesting these internally, which will lead to a shortage of supply in the market.


[28-Jan-23 02:56 AM] yuen8241#0000
The recent price increase of FIM\DDT\CL is estimated to be due to the recent explosive population growth of engineers in malahat.


[28-Jan-23 08:01 AM] jackinabox86#0000
I don‚Äôt think FIM would actually be that hard to take over


[28-Jan-23 08:01 AM] jackinabox86#0000
It‚Äôs a very time consuming chain


[28-Jan-23 08:01 AM] jackinabox86#0000
And you‚Äôd control HER as well


[28-Jan-23 10:10 AM] yjhasaday#0000
So I just realized in the in-game corp channel that I (and @allocater) was only 2 days short of a full year with OOG when I posted my good-bye message üòÖ - what are the odds! Thank you all once again for making it a great year üòé

Yeah, FIM could be controlled somewhat via controlling DDT and HER, and not dumping FIM on the market


[29-Jan-23 08:38 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have bought DDT and CL in large quantities from the market for a long time. These EDC farmers generally do not produce DDT, HER and FIM.


[29-Jan-23 08:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
Therefore, as long as we go to the electronics planet to build a large number of SE and compete with them for the engineer population, and do not sell FIM, DDT, HER and CL to the outside , these SE farmers will not be able to maintain.


[29-Jan-23 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
I may be the person who has the most SE among us, but I can make a surplus of these things besides CL.


[30-Jan-23 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't really have any big PRUN projects planned, so messing aroudn with the FIM market is kind of appealing to me. I've only operated in ANT space so far.... but I can see that galaxy-wide, the supply of DDT/HER/FIM isn't that high.

@evovWelcome to OOG's serverÔºÅYou can check the contents of welcome Channel and spreadsheets.


[01-Feb-23 02:28 AM] evov#0000
Hi hi


[01-Feb-23 02:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
If it is convenient, you can briefly introduce your main product types and ways of playing, so that everyone can get to know you quickly.üòÑ


[01-Feb-23 02:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can see the industry type and product type of the main members of the Corp on the spreadsheet.


[01-Feb-23 02:37 AM] evov#0000
I'm not sure if I have a "main" product type at the moment to be honest. But happy to answer any specific questions people might have.


[01-Feb-23 02:38 AM] yuen8241#0000
Do you mainly sell consumables or metallurgical and chemical products?


[01-Feb-23 02:39 AM] yuen8241#0000
We have a number of consumables suppliers and a shipbuilding industry chain, and we also produce a lot of fabs.

[01-Feb-23 02:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
It seems that your main focus is on HRT, and you mainly get AL and chemical products from ANT.


[01-Feb-23 02:40 AM] rune_242#0000
oh wow


[01-Feb-23 02:40 AM] evov#0000
I produce most consumables. (all but 3 up to the Engineer level ) Volume doesn't really warrant spending time on sci consumables from my perspective at this time.


[01-Feb-23 02:41 AM] yuen8241#0000
Tree and I both have bases in HRT, and I produce ALE, GIN and VG in avalon.


[01-Feb-23 02:42 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I'm mostly centered around HRT space. I've only just started moving into ANT space, and am in the process of developing a few new bases. Directionally, in ANT space, I want to make R/A fabs, and ship engines. Though it will take some time to build up this capacity.


[01-Feb-23 02:42 AM] rune_242#0000
do you have LABS's or PP3's/PP4's?


[01-Feb-23 02:43 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm similar to you. I can also produce most consumables, and I've started shipbuilding and producing Afabs.


[01-Feb-23 02:44 AM] evov#0000
I have 2 pp3's on OF-375c .. but the population development there is not suitable for pp4's. Tech's there are like.. 18/80. Still proffitable to make Rfabs, but doesn't make sense to develop that base any further.


[01-Feb-23 02:45 AM] evov#0000
Basically... population restrictions around the HRT area is the main reason I'm looking to set up bases on some of the better developed ANT planets.


[01-Feb-23 02:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
HRT is suitable for consumables and some low-end industries, but if you want to do something more advanced, you need to go to ANT or MOR.


[01-Feb-23 02:46 AM] evov#0000
I have 4 labs on helion prime. I'm still undecided on where/how to get more labs developed... though I know I'll need some.


[01-Feb-23 02:46 AM] yuen8241#0000
There are enough places on ANT's planet, so welcome to ANT.


[01-Feb-23 02:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can go to elon, where I just invested in an ART, and this planet is now managed by us.


[01-Feb-23 02:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
I just hired all the unemployed technicians in elon, and there is still a gap.

[01-Feb-23 02:49 AM] evov#0000
Yea... that's one of the options I've thought about. But, undecided. I'm kinda maxed out on permits at the moment... next one will cost me around 4mil... so I'm trying to make do with what I've got. So any new bases means I need to start cutting back on Prom/Avalon/Novahonshu ... and while it probably makes sense to do so... I don't really want to do it until it becomes essential.


[01-Feb-23 02:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
Nova is a manufacturing planet, rightÔºü


[01-Feb-23 02:50 AM] evov#0000
Yes


[01-Feb-23 02:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can go to heph, which is also a manufacturing planet.


[01-Feb-23 02:50 AM] yuen8241#0000
So you can save a permit.


[01-Feb-23 02:50 AM] evov#0000
I've already got the heph base founded.. just haven't built there yet.

[01-Feb-23 02:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
According to my experience, two manufacturing planets are enough.


[01-Feb-23 02:51 AM] yuen8241#0000
My two manufacturing bases are heph and katoa.


[01-Feb-23 02:52 AM] evov#0000
Of the 3... the 2nd/3rd permits on prom are my least proffitable. So that makes the most sense to cut. But again... not a bridge I need to cross right now since I've got 3 empty planets with a CM on it and nothing else. So  that's where my resoruces/focus will be ( Heph/Phobos/Nike)


[01-Feb-23 02:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can replace it slowly, just like what I'm doing.


[01-Feb-23 02:53 AM] evov#0000
While Deimos isn't technically empty, I've just got extractors/collectors on there as placeholders.


[01-Feb-23 02:53 AM] evov#0000
So there's lots of things to do before I need to think about cutting another permit out of existing bases.


[01-Feb-23 02:53 AM] yuen8241#0000
When the production capacity of the new base is established, you can dismantle some building saving permits of the old base.


[01-Feb-23 02:54 AM] evov#0000
Maybe. Again... I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.


[01-Feb-23 02:55 AM] yuen8241#0000
I now have 21 permit and 17 bases, and I will only spend extra licenses on the industrial core planet.


[01-Feb-23 02:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
For me, it's phobos and Heph, the twins in CX system.


[01-Feb-23 02:57 AM] yuen8241#0000
The combination of promitor and avalon is also good, but the output value of agriculture is still slightly lower, which is more suitable for the early stage.


[01-Feb-23 02:59 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I suspect that the move will be to drop a permit on prom and get a chem base on elon. But I'll have a closer look when I get to that point.


[01-Feb-23 03:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
ANT also has a food industry planet, although the population quality is not as good as avalon.


[01-Feb-23 03:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you have enough LCB, transportation is not a problem.


[01-Feb-23 03:01 AM] yuen8241#0000
Ant's agriculture and water are very poor, and HRT is too strong in this respect.


[01-Feb-23 03:02 AM] evov#0000
I have to lean heavily on shipping contracts as it is. So logistics is a tight spot for me. I have 2x 3k1k ships (upgraded from the starting ships) and 1 STL only 500/500 ship in HRT (since I have 4 bases in that system)


[01-Feb-23 03:03 AM] yuen8241#0000
My base is located in Ant \ Ben \ HRT, and I occasionally go to MOR, so I have 6 LCBs, 2 WCBs and 3 STL.


[01-Feb-23 03:03 AM] evov#0000
Well if anyone wants to sell me a ship, I'm down for it haha.


[01-Feb-23 03:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
I'm probably the person with the largest number of ships and the widest base distribution in Corp, and most of the others are concentrated in Ant.


[01-Feb-23 03:04 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you join corp, you can make a reservation with Allocator.


[01-Feb-23 03:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
If you have enough ships, you don't need to invest three permits in a base to reduce the transportation pressure.


[01-Feb-23 03:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
This is especially important considering that your base is cross-regional.


[01-Feb-23 03:09 AM] evov#0000
I'm hopeful, that I can lean on shipping contracts to do a decent amount of the heavy lifting, and have 1 ship in each region to pick up the slack... until I can get another ship.


[01-Feb-23 03:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
I haven't used the transportation contract for a long time, especially considering the piracy problem.


[01-Feb-23 03:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
Enough ships and enough consumables \ raw material reserves will make your operation very easy.


[01-Feb-23 03:14 AM] evov#0000
If there were ships on the CX... I'd have more üôÇ But I'll make do with what I've got until I can find one.


[01-Feb-23 04:40 PM] jackinabox86#0000
we produce a 2k/2k ship roughly every 3 days.  The wait is not long to get one


[01-Feb-23 06:08 PM] churavis#0000
Is anyone producing RCO?


[01-Feb-23 11:38 PM] exeler#0000
I do a small amount on Harmonia. I'm gonna be adding more HYF soon so I can probably increase production if there's demand for it.


[01-Feb-23 11:38 PM] churavis#0000
I demand it


[01-Feb-23 11:41 PM] exeler#0000
How much? Is this on a scale I could manage reasonably on the side, or would this require significant dedicated resources?

I have plans for most of the output of my Harmonia base at 500/500 so I don't want to give any false hope üòÖ


[01-Feb-23 11:41 PM] churavis#0000
Probably more than you could produce


[01-Feb-23 11:43 PM] churavis#0000
There are just so many consumables that need it. OVE, PWO, EXO, MED, SUN etc


[01-Feb-23 11:43 PM] churavis#0000
The more I get the more consumables I can provide to the corp


[01-Feb-23 11:45 PM] evov#0000
Sounds awesome. Can you msg me a spec list of the ship and a price?


[02-Feb-23 01:06 AM] mrtcsmith#0000

[03-Feb-23 07:45 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
What is worthwhile buying in Moria so that I can export it back and convert NCC to AIC?


[03-Feb-23 08:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
Very few, so I don't even go there to sell things.


[04-Feb-23 01:56 AM] allocater#0000
I have CBL at moria, but it's better to sell it at Hortus, ICA is the most valuable


[04-Feb-23 03:18 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
I got 550k of cheap BDE from Moria to sell at Hortus which is at the MM, then I will buy 10k RATs I suppose and send a ship to get them


[04-Feb-23 07:51 AM] churavis#0000
ANT BDE is also at the MM


[04-Feb-23 05:20 PM] mrtcsmith#0000

@syqel Welcome! You can check the welcome channel and get familiar with various forms.


[07-Feb-23 08:59 AM] thummper#0000
I still have to do math though right? Like (workforce cost + repair cost) / units of output


[07-Feb-23 09:00 AM] thummper#0000
It doesn't directly tell me what my cost per unit is somewhere?

It tells you the profit per unit at a price you specify. You can work that number down until your base has 0 net profit

Set up a base and set a price for an output. Here's an F extracting base:

@syqel Can you introduce yourself or ask some questions to Corp? We want to enhance mutual understanding.


[08-Feb-23 08:18 PM] yuen8241#0000
Besides, did you check the spreadsheet? If you are interested in joining Corp, you can fill in your base information.


[08-Feb-23 09:45 PM] syqel#0000
Helloüëã  So I started on Harmonia with farms and incinerators and made a bunch selling C - Added a base on Deimos when C price dropped to produce AL - started producing TI when I saw Yuen's decent request price
I had the idea to become as independent as possible so I built some FP which I recently moved to Norwick - I also have some CHP
I looked at the spreadsheet and will fill in my base info - I thought it was for corp members only
I have lots of strategy questions, should I ask those in strategy channel?


[08-Feb-23 09:47 PM] jackinabox86#0000
fire away!


[08-Feb-23 09:59 PM] syqel#0000
I just noticed that Terrascape who has an offer for LHP on ANT is from OOG corp and since I don't want to step on toes and I was thinking of shifting to producing more STL and TI anyways I thought I'd demolish my HWP and HB3 and build more SME - what do you think?


[08-Feb-23 10:02 PM] erklein#0000
I would say don't be afraid to step on toes. As far as SME, it's always great to have more production capacity especially in AL. It really depends on how much you want to link your supply chains to the corp as a whole, or how you want to play the game.


[08-Feb-23 10:04 PM] syqel#0000
Isn't that the whole point of joining a corp? To take advantage of the benefits of linking your supply chains and to do what everyone is best at?


[08-Feb-23 10:06 PM] erklein#0000
Mostly. But I think an important distinction is that we don't really run the corp as mandating that people produce and supply certain items to the corp. It should be that everyone is producing what they are because that's how they want to play


[08-Feb-23 10:08 PM] syqel#0000
I'm all about not mandating but having someone who can direct and make good suggestions shows it's a good corp - besides, I'm finding BHP and LHP to not be as lucrative as I thougt so...
Any suggestions?


[08-Feb-23 10:09 PM] erklein#0000
Overall, if you want to build more SME then build more SME (it's always in demand). If you want to have a HWP, have a HWP


[08-Feb-23 10:09 PM] erklein#0000
If you're looking for ways to contribue, then yes SME will be more beneficial (probably, I don't have a HWP to compare üôÇ )


[08-Feb-23 10:10 PM] erklein#0000
I'm sure others can also offer a variety of advice


[08-Feb-23 10:23 PM] syqel#0000
BHP and LHP produce quick - I'm having to shutter the HWP more & more - I'm going to build more SME but I'd like to find out if there's enough demand to keep the HWP around


[08-Feb-23 10:24 PM] churavis#0000
Ask Allocater, he's the shipwright and can tell you if the corp needs more LHP/BHP production


[08-Feb-23 10:55 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
He posted in the ship building channel that the bottleneck is LHP currently


[08-Feb-23 11:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you can supply me with Ti steadily, it will also be a great help to the shipbuilding industry.


[08-Feb-23 11:58 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have five ASM and one SKF to produce LCB and things like that.


[09-Feb-23 12:00 AM] yuen8241#0000
If I can't get a stable supplier, I will put a permit into ANT2-B to make myself produce enough Ti.


[09-Feb-23 12:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
I need about 40-50 Ti every day.


[09-Feb-23 12:06 AM] exeler#0000
I think this has a decent bit to do with the CX soaking up 80% of my output and multiple orders for AHP


[09-Feb-23 12:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
I also have more than 100 LHP bought from exeler.üòÜ

[09-Feb-23 01:43 AM] allocater#0000
yes, shipbuilding needs 220 LHP per week, but the market is also eating some up, so not sure if Exeler can supply both. Looks more profitable than SME to me: https://universallogistics.app/building/HWP if you can expect to sell half LHP at market 2.5-3k? and the other half at the bottom price of 1.9k


[09-Feb-23 01:44 AM] allocater#0000
BHP is even more profitable

So it looks like I'm not going to sell my 30 BHP on ANT unless I keep lowering the price and I'm sure annoying the heck out of those guys that keep lowering their price in front of me - Should I just bring it back to Deimos and sell it to the corp?


[10-Feb-23 10:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can keep reducing the price.üòÜ


[10-Feb-23 10:44 PM] syqel#0000
I like your thinking!


[10-Feb-23 10:46 PM] yuen8241#0000
Because you have fewer types of products, you have enough energy to keep reducing prices with them.


[10-Feb-23 10:47 PM] syqel#0000
So how does one determine/calculate how much to sell on the market vs keeping in store for corp members to buy, especially in the face of rising market prices? Do corp members come first so always keep enough for that demand?


[10-Feb-23 10:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
Usually, you need to ensure that you are profitable as a whole, and then consider the members of Corp


[10-Feb-23 10:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
If Corp needs something like LHP, it will place an order with you. If you don't have an order, you can sell it to cx


[10-Feb-23 10:58 PM] syqel#0000
How does one determine a price for things they can provide not listed on the spreadsheet?


[10-Feb-23 11:04 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Basically whatever you are comfortable with, don't offer cut price and risk losing money and not being able to expand, most of us can afford the CX prices so your discount prices are a nice to have


[10-Feb-23 11:19 PM] yuen8241#0000
We prefer to keep products with strategic value inside the Corp, especially those that can improve the development ability of the members of the Corp.

There shouldn't be any Corp that has the same influence as OOG in ANT.


[13-Feb-23 06:40 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can't find a Corp in ANT that can produce more complicated products such as ships than OOG.


[13-Feb-23 06:42 PM] yuen8241#0000
Besides, I think it's hard for you to find a more generous Corp than OOG.


[13-Feb-23 07:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah I think so, it was just counting specific cells and they'd gone bad over time. This one's much more dynamic


[13-Feb-23 07:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
I hope you didn't count the retired members.


[13-Feb-23 07:53 PM] hernanduer#0000
That's what it was doing


[13-Feb-23 07:54 PM] hernanduer#0000

[13-Feb-23 07:57 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, it could count the whole column if they're removed


[13-Feb-23 08:00 PM] yuen8241#0000
I don't think it's a big deal to remove their information, because many of them have demolished their bases.


[13-Feb-23 08:01 PM] yuen8241#0000
We can keep their information on the activity page.


[13-Feb-23 08:11 PM] yuen8241#0000
I put the information of retirees in a separate form, so that it will never be affected again.

[13-Feb-23 08:24 PM] yuen8241#0000
In order to avoid the color indistinguishability, the color is modified according to the discord avatar for the people below those whose information has been removed.


[13-Feb-23 08:25 PM] exeler#0000
Also, it's google sheets. I'm pretty sure it keeps versions of the file so if we really needed to dig up the info it is still there. 

Also if we want, it's super easy to just save a copy as a snapshot.


[13-Feb-23 08:26 PM] yuen8241#0000
Do we have some full members who have not filled in the information? It seems that there are not enough.

or a we losing money when selling ships at corp price?


[14-Feb-23 07:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Probably the same situation as when we're selling discounting fabs internally, or discount RAT/DW, etc. It should still be a profit, just not as much as the CX profit.


[14-Feb-23 07:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
Regarding the planet count on the sheet, the most accurate count is on the "Player Activity and Base List" sheet. That data comes from FIO. If you scroll down there's two lists of planets and the OOG base count (one alphabetical and one sorted by base count)

is there anything  really important that @yjhasaday made for us?


[14-Feb-23 09:53 AM] yjhasaday#0000
I think fuel was the main one and some pretty big steps have been taken to fill that hole. I have also sold a lot of H or AMM to corp members but there are a few suppliers of those now. And the last thing I did was GF stuff, which I think should be covered with the new GF planet? We haven't made a GEN ship in a long time lol

Is a buy contract fulfilled directly into a ship if there is no other storage available?


[15-Feb-23 01:05 PM] _bojidar#0000
No


[15-Feb-23 01:13 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Ah so there is effectively no way of picking up a buy contract if the warehouse isn't big enough to fit it?


[15-Feb-23 01:13 PM] churavis#0000
Sell contracts can go straight to a ship's cargo


[15-Feb-23 01:14 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The other person no longer has pro and I didn't consider that before paying


[15-Feb-23 01:15 PM] churavis#0000
You'll have to break it up into chunks small enough to fit in the warehouse then


[15-Feb-23 09:04 PM] syqel#0000
I've noticed sometimes people offer prices higher than the stated price in the spreadsheet. Is this because they are feeling generous, feel bad because the exchange bid values are much higher, they are in a hurry to get it soon, all of the above, something else? What's the thinking here?


[15-Feb-23 09:04 PM] churavis#0000
What?


[15-Feb-23 09:05 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Where do you see the higher prices? On the LM?


[15-Feb-23 09:06 PM] syqel#0000
In the planet channels when someone needs something they'll specify a higher price in their offer

I haven't sold any fabs on cx for a long time. My fabs is either for personal use or sold to others with a loan.


[15-Feb-23 09:23 PM] yuen8241#0000
I took the lead in raising the price of Lfabs because you mentioned that you were slaughtered on Lfabs.


[15-Feb-23 09:29 PM] yuen8241#0000
I only have five PP2, and I am sponsoring some bases continuously. I waited all day and no one wanted them, so I took them, because without them, I need to give the money to others to buy them from you.

A harmonia base full of HYF and norwick can produce at least 1k RAT +1k DW every day.


[20-Feb-23 03:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
It can even provide enough crops for nascent to burn at the same time.


[20-Feb-23 03:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
In the past, consumables and C were so cheap that using HYF to produce crops lost money. Now is the right time to do so.

[20-Feb-23 03:26 AM] yuen8241#0000
We can dynamically adjust the production capacity of water, DW, RAT and C according to the price fluctuation.


[20-Feb-23 03:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
The disadvantage is that HYF need a large investment, and these four bases need an LCB to maintain.


[20-Feb-23 03:28 AM] habix3956#0000
is there no better h2o producing planet near?


[20-Feb-23 03:28 AM] habix3956#0000
As far as I know  HYF can be built anywhere


[20-Feb-23 03:32 AM] habix3956#0000
https://universallogistics.app/building/HYF seems that both frm & hyf have ultra low profits atm


[20-Feb-23 03:33 AM] yuen8241#0000
But you need to enjoy agricultural COGC, and HYF products are much heavier than its raw materials, so you need to be closer to FP base than H2O base.

HYF's profit is very low, but this industrial chain allows you to have a stable supply of DW, RAT and C.


[20-Feb-23 03:35 AM] yuen8241#0000
ANT has no high-quality agricultural planet, so Harmonia's HYF is the only way to get enough C and RAT at the same time.


[20-Feb-23 03:36 AM] yuen8241#0000
Demeter is too far away, and the two FRM planets together cannot maintain the INC base and FP base at the same time.


[20-Feb-23 03:37 AM] yuen8241#0000
I think in ANT's case, demeter is more suitable for producing HER or HOP, rather than burning C or making RAT crops.


[20-Feb-23 08:26 AM] hernanduer#0000

This has been on my steam wishlist forever. Is it fun?


[24-Feb-23 07:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's pretty fun. It's minecraft with a tech tree sort of similar to various modded minecrafts. Looks a lot nicer. Depending on the people you are playing with, it can sort of be a big cooperative game, or a cut-throat economic simulation as people set up stores and calculate prices. Obviously a lot more casual and less spreadsheet-y than PRUN. It is moderately grindy. But the tech trees are pretty fun and seeing the world evolve is nice. I like building and decorating houses, so that's pretty fun for me.


[24-Feb-23 07:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
The ecological simulation is present and kind of interesting, but it's also somewhat irrelevant and can often be ignored.

Nope, but I'm guessing your best option is to pull it in from FIO's burnrate api

[25-Feb-23 08:22 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The burn rate indication on the consumbles buffer is nice but it doesn't provide a number to get back to green either.

It does show overall needs, it just doesn't tell you how much you need to get into the green, but you can calc that easy


[26-Feb-23 12:26 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah fio burn is what I use which shows needs to green, I'm referring to the

[26-Feb-23 04:17 PM] gl4ucon#0000

[26-Feb-23 04:21 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I would suggest that you aim for something that is going to be consistently in demand like ship parts, fabs or consumables and produce most things along the chain. You need to be careful that you don't over produce which can be easy to do with high end consumables.


[26-Feb-23 04:22 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
As you work along the chain, there may be an extraction base or similar that you can just mass produce something that other corp members will buy in bulk


[26-Feb-23 04:23 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I did this for HAL for example, it produces significantly more than I need so it supplies some other corp players too.


[26-Feb-23 04:24 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I also don't make any workforce consumables, they distract from the things I want to produce


[26-Feb-23 06:15 PM] archielvahr#0000

[26-Feb-23 09:57 PM] yuen8241#0000

Hey @parisinspringtime - welcome. Take some time to look around if you want and if you like it, feel free to reach to any of the guys to invite you after 7 days. We'll most likely forget about it :P. 

Feel free to check the #welcome  and #rules-faq channels as well. And if you like what you see, think it might be the right place for you, you should fill in the sheet in #welcome channel with your production so we all know what you make and how much you'd want to charge for it within the corp. 

I've been trading with Paris quite a lot in the past few weeks and helping each other out. Alongside Habix he's been using my C production and ALO on Deimos.

[04-Mar-23 06:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
One of my goals is to store every consumable in ANT, which is enough for the whole cx of ANT for one week.


[04-Mar-23 09:26 AM] archielvahr#0000

Cool


[06-Mar-23 10:37 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Interesting no one has expanded to ZV-759d.  I have that one in my long-term expansion plans


[06-Mar-23 10:38 PM] churavis#0000
What makes you think no one is on ZV-759d?


[06-Mar-23 10:38 PM] draconisdomini#0000
The spreadsheet doesn't have anything listed for ZV-759d


[06-Mar-23 10:39 PM] churavis#0000
That doesn't mean no one is there, just that no one is selling anything from there


[06-Mar-23 10:40 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Oh, ok


[06-Mar-23 10:40 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I was planning to develop it as a chemistry base, eventually


[06-Mar-23 10:41 PM] churavis#0000
It's a good planet, if you can source enough INS and HSE


[06-Mar-23 10:42 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Yeah, that's why it is long-term


[06-Mar-23 10:42 PM] churavis#0000
Griffonstone is farther away but MCG only and has high tier workers


[06-Mar-23 10:44 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I like the idea of having a focus in a single system to cut down transportation


[06-Mar-23 10:45 PM] churavis#0000
Ships are a one-time expense, maintenance costs are forever


[06-Mar-23 10:45 PM] draconisdomini#0000
True


[06-Mar-23 10:46 PM] draconisdomini#0000
But since you only need 1 HSE, you shouldn't need to provide that for repairs if you don't let things degrade too far, right?


[06-Mar-23 10:46 PM] churavis#0000
No, repair costs round up, meaning you need 1 HSE no matter when you repair, from day 1 to day 180


[06-Mar-23 10:47 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Damn, I thought it rounded down


[06-Mar-23 10:49 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Maybe I'll change that plan


[06-Mar-23 10:52 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Well, that's not for a while anyway.  Expanding Harmonia and rationalising Deimos first


[06-Mar-23 11:04 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Checked PRUNner again and it shows repair costs at only around 10% of profit for my ZV-759d plan, so I'll probably keep that.  Still, will be a little while before I have the 1.7mil to fund it though


[07-Mar-23 01:31 AM] yuen8241#0000

what is that (+327) next to the amount of plots?


[07-Mar-23 07:27 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
I believe its ghost plots? 328 players would need to remove their base before there is an open slot for someone to settle on that planet.

Most of promitor's players started there.


[07-Mar-23 09:57 AM] erklein#0000
New players can always start on starter planets even if there aren‚Äôt any plots available on the planet count, which causes the overflow


[08-Mar-23 09:35 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Does anyone produce PG for less than 36AIC/unit?


[09-Mar-23 07:28 PM] yuen8241#0000
I have the impression that there are many people who can do it.


[09-Mar-23 08:14 PM] exeler#0000
I'm pretty sure everyone who makes PG makes it for cheaper than that.

Depends on whether you make your own carbon or not


[09-Mar-23 08:35 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I was going to stop making C simply to not have as many bases, the difference between making and buying enough for my own needs over 30 days is about 1.3mil. There is an argument there somewhere about opportunity cost but that's a huge difference.

[09-Mar-23 08:38 PM] yuen8241#0000
I guess your C consumption is less than 100 a day.


[09-Mar-23 08:38 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
No, it's 184


[09-Mar-23 08:39 PM] yuen8241#0000
So your unit price for C is 235?


[09-Mar-23 08:40 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I have 2x SME, 2x EPO, 1x PG and some other smaller C uses


[09-Mar-23 08:40 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I consider by C buy price to be 300/u

[09-Mar-23 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
I don't think this price is possible


[09-Mar-23 08:41 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I buy C from myself at 300, the CX average according to the FIO API is 536.54


[09-Mar-23 08:41 PM] yuen8241#0000
Sometimes, the price of C in HRT  will be close to 500.


[09-Mar-23 08:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
You calculate your C price at 300, which is really too low.


[09-Mar-23 08:43 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Why? I'm an internal market of 1.


[09-Mar-23 08:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
According to the current crop price, maybe 300 can only maintain not making a loss.


[09-Mar-23 08:44 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I don't buy crops though


[09-Mar-23 08:45 PM] yuen8241#0000
In my opinion, you should consider the profit of every link in the whole production chain.


[09-Mar-23 08:48 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Every part of the chain is profitable in itself and either I'm spreading the profit out by raising how much I pay myself for each part or I just have a super profitable end product, the outcome seems the same. I'm not going to micro manage how much each part is costing me just because the CX changes a little bit every day.


[09-Mar-23 08:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
The difference is that you can use raw materials or intermediate goods produced by others to improve your overall profit, which is the significance of accounting the profit of each base separately.


[09-Mar-23 08:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
Isn't it what you are trying to do now? Give up the production of C to do something more profitable.


[09-Mar-23 08:52 PM] yuen8241#0000
Overall accounting is suitable for those products whose intermediate products lack trading volume.


[09-Mar-23 09:02 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I buy barely any raw or intermediate goods. Most of my purchases are consumables, I don't make any.


[09-Mar-23 09:02 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
No, I was considering giving up C production so I didn't have as many bases.


[09-Mar-23 09:03 PM] yuen8241#0000
I am completely opposite to you. I rely heavily on purchasing raw materials such as C, AL, Ti, CL and EPO, but I can produce a lot of consumables.


[09-Mar-23 09:04 PM] yuen8241#0000
I guess I will be the first one among us to produce all kinds of consumables.


[09-Mar-23 09:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
I checked. In fact, I have already achieved it. I don't produce COF and KOM just because their profits are too low.


[09-Mar-23 09:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
If their prices soar, I may switch production.


[09-Mar-23 10:00 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I was more wondering if anyone would be willing to sell me some PG


[09-Mar-23 10:01 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Also, the ANT exchange is out of COF


[09-Mar-23 10:01 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I have an order for 3000 PG up at ANT for 36/unit


[09-Mar-23 10:03 PM] churavis#0000
I can spare a little bit of COF and PG if anyone is desperate


[09-Mar-23 10:04 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I really need the PG


[09-Mar-23 10:04 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I have a production line that is idle at the moment for lack of PG


[09-Mar-23 10:04 PM] churavis#0000
Where?


[09-Mar-23 10:04 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Harmonia


[09-Mar-23 10:05 PM] churavis#0000
I don't have any on Harmonia but you can send me a contract for up to 3k on ANT for 25/u


[09-Mar-23 10:09 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Contract sent


[09-Mar-23 10:09 PM] churavis#0000
You need any coffee?


[09-Mar-23 10:10 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I'm ok for COF at the moment, I got 100 before the CX ran out

It seems that there are not enough FP in the universe.


[09-Mar-23 10:18 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Good thing I'm expanding my consumable production on Harmonia then.  I don't produce FIM or COF at the moment though


[09-Mar-23 10:20 PM] yuen8241#0000
You can consider building an industrial chain of harmonia's HYF and norwick's FP to produce a lot of DW, RAT and COF.


[09-Mar-23 10:23 PM] draconisdomini#0000
At the moment I'm producing RAT, DW, OVE, EXO and PWO


[09-Mar-23 10:23 PM] draconisdomini#0000
The OVE/EXO/PWO line is what needs the PG


[09-Mar-23 10:27 PM] draconisdomini#0000
It felt like a waste to use HYF rather than FRM on Harmonia and not take advantage of it being a fertile planet


[09-Mar-23 10:27 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I'll probably shift my FP over to Norwick eventually though


[09-Mar-23 11:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
Harmonia is not a fertile planet.


[09-Mar-23 11:43 PM] yuen8241#0000
Its fertility bonus is negative.


[09-Mar-23 11:44 PM] churavis#0000
It's more fertile than most planets


[09-Mar-23 11:44 PM] yuen8241#0000
I'd rather go to proxion and nemenis to build FRM


[09-Mar-23 11:45 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Neither of which are close to Antares


[09-Mar-23 11:46 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
The drive to super optimisation is not good for new players and suggesting planets in different regions is not feasible for a lot of players in general


[09-Mar-23 11:48 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I only have three bases.  Deimos, Harmonia and Nike


[09-Mar-23 11:48 PM] yuen8241#0000
New players can use harmonia to supply FP of Norwick and INC of nascent through the combination of FRM+HYF.


[09-Mar-23 11:49 PM] yuen8241#0000
If you only have three bases, it is better for you to use FRM of harmonia and FP of norwick, but generally speaking, an agricultural planet can't maintain an FP planet unless it has HYF.


[09-Mar-23 11:49 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
but saying that Harmonia isn't fertile is misleading, it's the best fertile planet that the region has


[09-Mar-23 11:50 PM] draconisdomini#0000
My FPs are on Harmonia with the FRMs and my INCs are on Deimos with the SMEs.  I might separate things out more later, but at the moment that's the way my bases work


[09-Mar-23 11:50 PM] yuen8241#0000
Demeter is more fertile than Harmonia.


[09-Mar-23 11:50 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Demeter is also much, much further


[09-Mar-23 11:51 PM] draconisdomini#0000
And managing that with my two starter ships would be difficult


[09-Mar-23 11:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
FRM's proprietary products HER and GRN should be produced by demeter.


[09-Mar-23 11:51 PM] yuen8241#0000
Unless you produce FIM, FP-related products are heavy and need an LCB.


[09-Mar-23 11:52 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Demeter seems like it would be better suited to ORC and higher tier products


[09-Mar-23 11:52 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
"should" is best replaced by "is best produced when you are an established player trying to optimise"

üëÜ 

[09-Mar-23 11:53 PM] yuen8241#0000
Generally speaking, it is enough for you to have an ORC. There is only one food planet in ANT area. If you produce ORC products, you only need one agricultural planet to maintain norwick.


[09-Mar-23 11:55 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I only have pioneers and settlers on any of my bases, so I don't need the higher tier consumables yet anyway


[09-Mar-23 11:56 PM] yuen8241#0000
In order to maintain a norwick full of buildings, you can choose three ORC Harmonia, or FRM+HYF Harmonia, or FRM Harmonia, with an area of 1,000, or FRM harmonia+demeter, or Etherwind/ICE Station+Harmonia,.


[09-Mar-23 11:57 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I'm expanding Harmonia up to 1000


[09-Mar-23 11:57 PM] yuen8241#0000
This is one of the cheapest combinations and the lowest transportation volume in the previous period.


[09-Mar-23 11:58 PM] draconisdomini#0000

I also am buying those off the CX in large quantites regardless of price :THONK:


[11-Mar-23 05:00 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Is there a source of AR in the corp?


[11-Mar-23 05:03 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
No one on the spreadsheet, the CX is out of both AR and INS. The price of INS was going to the moon before it ran out as well.


[11-Mar-23 05:05 AM] yuen8241#0000
I have 325 AR in ANT


[11-Mar-23 05:07 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Did you get it from the CX?


[11-Mar-23 05:07 AM] yuen8241#0000
I bought some AR from rune before, and I also bought some from CX.


[11-Mar-23 05:11 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
It doesn't make much sense for me to buy it from someone who already uses it to make INS, I assume someone has a base on KI-401d which is likely the primary source in the region.


[11-Mar-23 05:11 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
Another KI-401d base might be required. The price of H is also creeping up again which also comes from KI-401d.


[11-Mar-23 05:24 AM] yuen8241#0000
Are you interested in this base?


[11-Mar-23 12:25 PM] erklein#0000

[14-Mar-23 10:04 PM] churavis#0000
It's based on what you pay for stuff


[14-Mar-23 10:09 PM] yuen8241#0000
Of these two figures, one should be the value of the goods you sell and the other the money you pay for the goods.


[14-Mar-23 10:09 PM] yuen8241#0000
I prefer that receipt of materials is the value of the goods you sell.


[14-Mar-23 11:00 PM] emperyan11#0000

:this:  bot adds a new `/auction` command you all can use to sell bulk items that can be distributed evenly among people who want it. People who want some click a `Bid!` button, and once you're ready to send out contracts you click `Finish` and the bot will calculate how much each person should get and tell you the total price to plug in for the contracts.

Fair warning though, the bot is really dumb right now and it'll forget about any auctions that were in progress if it restarts. (It's what you get for like 3 hours of work üòÖ)

My next TODO item is to make that not happen any more. Since the bot is running on a dedicated server it shouldn't need to restart except for when I go to push the update. Ideally this reset happens exactly once (and I'll try and time it for when there's no auction going) unless something bad happens to the server I'm using.

I love the new auction tool. Makes it really easy to sell stuff. My I just suggest that the creator adds the location as a parameter? It makes sense if we're posting stuff on the auction channel rather than in planet chat.


[18-Mar-23 01:41 PM] exeler#0000
I actually added that to my to-do list almost as soon as people started using it üòÖ 

It should be a trivial change to make, I just need to tackle the persistence issue before I make any other changes to the bot first. Right now if I update the bot it'll forget about any currently running auctions üòÖ

How is one supposed to deal with shipping contracts accepted but the shipper won't pay the shipping fees and won't communicate with you?


[18-Mar-23 02:27 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Who is the shipper? Is it an old account?


[18-Mar-23 03:45 PM] syqel#0000
Dover | GFG - 752 days


[18-Mar-23 05:54 PM] domicius#0000
You can try the UFO channel on Discord, see if he's there. Otherwise he might just be very irregular.


[18-Mar-23 05:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
his activity is C, he might not be on much


[18-Mar-23 06:30 PM] syqel#0000
I tried UFO - His status was 'Do Not Disturb' but I messaged him anyways, saw his status change to cell phone for a minute then Disconnected  - Probably woke him up
Anyways the contracts are breached now because he didn't extend them - I don't think he cares - I'm sending him a direct contract for the goods for the price of the shipping plus warehouse fees - We'll see if he accepts it and if he does I'm going to fulfill whether he pays or not - If he doesn't then I'll have a bunch of AL to sell
What I'm wondering now is if there is any recourse to report/blacklist him or something like that?


[18-Mar-23 07:55 PM] domicius#0000
Nah. It's part of the game, after all


[18-Mar-23 07:55 PM] domicius#0000
In theory his trustworthiness takes a ding, but it would need to be a lot of these. You can however block him if you like.


[18-Mar-23 10:02 PM] syqel#0000
Well as long as everyone in OOG knows not to trust him now


[19-Mar-23 01:23 PM] domicius#0000

Why do I have so many rigs on Harmonia? What's the best place to get regular shipments of H2O?

Etherwind or SE-648b

Does/Could anyone make regular trips to Harmonia? Or even ANT?


[21-Mar-23 10:13 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Ice Station Alpha has higher water than SE-648b and is two jumps closer to ANT, but it is also high pressure as well as being low temperature.


[21-Mar-23 10:55 PM] syqel#0000
So are you offering regular installments of H2O? Or are you just saying I'd be better off trying to get fulfillments there? Could I get a 5000 unit ad filled?


[21-Mar-23 11:45 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I'm not offering myself, but I'd say you have a good chance of getting a 5000 unit ad filled there

[25-Mar-23 06:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
You can produce EPO or PG, which are easy to sell.


[25-Mar-23 06:10 AM] yuen8241#0000
DEC has a small market and is generally used in shipbuilding or infrastructure upgrading.


[25-Mar-23 06:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
Whether you produce PG, EPO or DEC, I will buy it.


[25-Mar-23 06:11 AM] yuen8241#0000
@parisinspringtime


[25-Mar-23 06:26 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
@yuen8241 You've bought EPO from me before and I'm now producing PG. I was just looking at whether PG + EPO -> DEC was worthwhile. The CX is dismal for DEC, which is why I asked. 
I have the capacity so I'm happy to produce to order if that is wanted. Else I'll stick to PG for the moment.


[25-Mar-23 06:27 AM] yuen8241#0000
How many Pol do you have?


[25-Mar-23 06:31 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
In total? 35 POL, with another 20 planned. I don't have any call for either EPO or PG at the moment, but that will change in the near future.


[25-Mar-23 06:32 AM] yuen8241#0000
Are you interested in building a WPL base to produce some NL, since you can produce PG yourself?


[25-Mar-23 06:43 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Unfortunately not. I already have a base on Heph producing for someone else that predates my joining OOG, and I have ZV-307e & SE-866e already earmarked. There aren't any Manufacturing planets left in ANT space.


[26-Mar-23 09:09 PM] yuen8241#0000

[26-Mar-23 09:30 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
RAT


[26-Mar-23 09:32 PM] yuen8241#0000
I consume 1k RATs and 1k DWs a day. RATs are totally bought from HRT. If I produce them myself, I need HYF, otherwise the agricultural base will not be enough.


[26-Mar-23 09:33 PM] yuen8241#0000
A RIG base and a HYF base can support the daily production of 1k RAT+1k DW, while maintaining an INC base.


[26-Mar-23 09:34 PM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that permit is in short supply, but ships can be bought without limit, this scheme will become more and more attractive as the price of RAT rises.


[27-Mar-23 06:18 AM] domicius#0000
Hmm. Fast or slow INC?

If you're going all in, throw in a Demeter base for GRN and MAI. I run 50/50 on Nascent with the HCP+GRN and HCP+MAI recipe. 

I'm building a stockpile of all 3 there now and if I needed to I can turn on the fast fast recipe and make ridiculous amounts of C in a short period.

Most cases are worth it.


[28-Mar-23 10:05 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
On my Elon (PG) base, COF needs to be over 5k before the profit of having COF is negated by the cost.

not the loss of production, but the cost in repairs


[28-Mar-23 04:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm guessing it's a % of the mats needed to create the building initially

A1A is really a good place to produce electronic non-software products. It is too close to CX, and it is very convenient to transport things like CU.

I‚Äôm going to be rather unavailable for the next few weeks. If I have a contract open with people, I‚Äôll be doing my best to fulfill it but might take some extra time to fulfill. Also, keep an eye on Harmonia; I‚Äôll be doing my best to keep it stocked but it might get away from me


[04-Apr-23 06:54 AM] yuen8241#0000
Someone needs to keep an eye on harmonia. I have no base there now.

I wouldn't have the first clue what to do. If someone could walk me thru it I can buy stuff at the CX to throw in.

[04-Apr-23 04:43 PM] erklein#0000
Harmonia has been doing fine with the current level of SST fully stocked. It will probably need another level as it continues to grow, but it‚Äôs honestly easier for me to manage with fully supplying it. What I meant by keeping an eye on it is making sure the COG is supplied (and maybe the SST if supplies drop low)


[04-Apr-23 04:59 PM] archielvahr#0000

Sorry to do it, but I'm going to have to step away from the game.  I'll likely sell everything I have over the next couple weeks and then send out whatever cash I have to active members of the corp.  If there's anything I produce that you'd like in particular or other needs, please let me know.

besides inflation


[10-Apr-23 10:07 AM] churavis#0000
Nobody is selling crops because it just makes more sense to convert them into RAT yourself


[10-Apr-23 10:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
true, but the people selling crops are still selling them like RATs are at 90 and not 130


[10-Apr-23 12:35 PM] exeler#0000
It could be that nobody is buying the crops from the CX. 

I think any one base processing a meaningful volume of crops will dry out the CX completely so nobody really relies on the CX for basic crops.

yeah, true

I think it's close enough to a solid color that when it is small it might as well be.

Has anyone else stopped supplying COF to some/all bases?


[27-Apr-23 06:48 PM] churavis#0000
No, I make it myself and even have some surplus that I use for Phobos upkeep. I can supply small amounts in an emergency


[27-Apr-23 06:49 PM] churavis#0000
You could always put a base on Norwick and make it yourself


[27-Apr-23 06:50 PM] churavis#0000
You kind of have to make your own FP base eventually as the market is just too unreliable


[27-Apr-23 06:57 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah I have considered a multi permit etherwind base to make DW and RAT, those are bigger opportunities than COF but I also have to consider the cost of not using COF at all

Bot doesn't put nickname into auction bidders list (#1) ¬∑ Issues ¬∑ ...
It uses the raw username for the user, so if a user's propserous name is different from their discord username the auction results are harder to use.

[27-Apr-23 06:59 PM] churavis#0000
If a production line isn't adding enough value to make COF worth it then you should consider restructuring or getting rid of it as that's a really low bar even at the high prices for COF on the CX


[27-Apr-23 07:04 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah probably but if I was to go to the CX and attempt to start buying the ALO output of Nascent, CUO output of KI-840c or BOR output of Electronica then I would have other problems

I'm working on the savefile then I'll make a PR


[27-Apr-23 07:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
does gitlab do PRs?


[27-Apr-23 07:15 PM] churavis#0000
Well that's why I said production line instead of base, because even if mining ALO isn't worth it, the whole AL line is worth it and all the things made with AL even more


[27-Apr-23 07:16 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, they're called Merge Requests instead of Pull Requests with gitlab, but it's the same concept.


[27-Apr-23 07:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah, right, a better name if you ask me


[27-Apr-23 07:19 PM] exeler#0000
I agree. 

For the savefile I was planning on using an sqlite database since I'm pretty savvy with database stuff and python has a built in sqlite driver. 

Makes an easy transition to something like MySQL if the bot ever does get some heavier use (or a web UI frontend if we ever want an Ooga Booga webpage that is integrated with the bot)


[27-Apr-23 07:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
I was just leaving it in memory and making a json savefile üòÖ but it looks like the routed bucket endpoints associated with hikari need to be saved too or else the buttons are useless after a restart


[27-Apr-23 07:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
since each Bid and Finish button gets its own special endpoint


[27-Apr-23 07:34 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, Hikari has some magic going on with how it associates the objects with the messages. 

I picked the library up randomly just for this so I'm definitely not an expert on how to use it lol.


[27-Apr-23 07:39 PM] exeler#0000
The json savefile as a stop gap is a good idea though. It'll make it so the app can be redeployed without wiping everything, which is the biggest problem right now üòÖ


[27-Apr-23 07:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, lol


[27-Apr-23 07:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think I found an example in the miru code on how to make this work, I'll see if I can get an MR tonight maybe


[27-Apr-23 07:55 PM] exeler#0000
That'd be super cool. I've got some work projects wrapping up so I'll have some more bandwidth for code things. I was hoping to get back to this bot and make it nice.

Thanks to @hernanduer  the bot has some cool new features !

`/auction` now has a field for the `location`

Auctions also won't be forgotten about if the bot restarts.

Completed auction results will also now list out our display names rather than our raw usernames.

So agricultural, make food, or make chemicals that's pretty good

FP base on Norwick could be interesting, even if you don't have enough crops and water, I think we have enough, and also HER, MTP,  etc that can be converted at a good profit

It finally went away after several minutes - Most likely a server update issue with my buffer


[04-May-23 04:23 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
You needed to update the page/buffer pretty regularly. I now do it all the time - instead of closing all open tabs when making a sale/contract/etc, I often refresh the page instead. It's probably a lot more than is required but this makes sure the buffer is always up-to-date.

I don't have a channel anywhere set up yet. 

So far there hasn't been a huge need for it. The occasional DM and discussions in the issues are good for now. 

I wouldn't want to put the dev channel in here since the bot isn't specifically an OOG thing (although we're the only ones using it so far). 

I also don't think the project is quite ready for announcing/sharing in the general tools discord yet, but when it is ready for more eyes and collaboration I think asking for a channel there would be the way I'll go.

There's generally two things to look for in a planet. The resources it has available, and what the CoGC typically gets voted for. 

The resources are important if you're planning on doing extraction, and the cocg provides the boost to specific industries. 

You should be able to see the resource info from the planet's view in game. That view should also link to the cogc if the planet has one built.

The COGC (the first image) has the construction campaign so that gives a 25% bonus to construction. The extraction rates in the second image are the 100% rates, with the COGC and experts etc being put on top of that.

why we have etherwind channel but no ice-station?


[23-May-23 09:34 PM] martin1194#0000
etherwind not ANT area. what make us prefer etherwind more than ice-station?


[23-May-23 09:39 PM] martin1194#0000
H2O price rise again.  LOL


[23-May-23 09:44 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Etherwind is cheaper to build on isn't it? It's also nearly equal distance between Antares and Benten.

Etherwind is 50% further than Ice Station from ANT, and makes 10% less H2O, but is _a lot_ cheaper to build on.


[24-May-23 02:35 PM] allocater#0000
if investment capital is no issue, I wonder which one is more profitable.


[24-May-23 02:36 PM] allocater#0000
building decay vs 10% water


[24-May-23 03:05 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
In this case, _all things being equal_ (i.e. building repair amd consumables are taken at market value), Etherwind is more profitable even though it makes less H2O.


[24-May-23 04:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think ISA also causes more ship damage


[24-May-23 04:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
not much though, small factor


[24-May-23 04:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
Etherwind's price is ~9.75/u, ISA is about 12/u with depreciation and taxes taken into account


[24-May-23 04:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
ISA has a cooler name, although Etherwind is up there.

[24-May-23 04:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
I guess they have the same efficiency either way


[24-May-23 04:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
maybe it's a subterranean ocean?


[24-May-23 06:26 PM] erklein#0000
I know I prefer ISA as it's also right next door to my base on ZV-639d which helps with keeping the NS running


[25-May-23 02:30 AM] martin1194#0000
only can repair at shipyard?


[25-May-23 02:46 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
This isn't true; an EXT takes up 25 area and 60 PIOs, while a RIG takes up 10 area and 30 PIOs, yet they function exactly the same. A RIG is 2.5x more efficient than an EXT.

No, you can only repair at a base with the mats in the base inventory


[25-May-23 08:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
That‚Äòs why I left over 10 LHPs at all my bases


[25-May-23 08:47 AM] yuen8241#0000
It's really strange why we can't repair ships at  CX. Don't all space games have space shipyards?


[25-May-23 08:50 AM] churavis#0000
There has been talk of my it so you can repair from warehouses on planets with shipyards as that's what a lot of noobs assume is how it works anyways.


[25-May-23 08:52 AM] yuen8241#0000
So why can't a shipyard be built in CX in the game?


[25-May-23 08:53 AM] churavis#0000
Because the CX doesn't have enough gravity or population to support it?


[25-May-23 09:02 AM] yuen8241#0000
But many spaceships are only more suitable for building in space, because there is no gravity. As for manpower, robots can be used completely.


[25-May-23 09:04 AM] churavis#0000
It's not that you need gravity on the shipyard itself, it's that you need a body large enough to produce a Lagrange point stable enough for a large structure


[25-May-23 09:40 AM] yuen8241#0000
Considering that the shipping volume of prun' spaceship is so low, I don't think it is necessary to have a huge structure.


[25-May-23 09:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, even the VCB is only about the size of 5 houses strapped together. 2000sqft=185m2 * 3m average height * 5 = 2775m^3


[25-May-23 09:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
or another way, it's about 45 standard shipping containers


[25-May-23 09:55 AM] hernanduer#0000
or even a better way, SpaceX starship, which is launching from the ground, is 1k m^3


[25-May-23 09:55 AM] hernanduer#0000

[25-May-23 09:56 AM] yuen8241#0000

is there any way to do it?


[05-Jun-23 04:19 AM] mrtcsmith#0000
The number of warehouses is limited by the level of the warehouse, there isn't much reason to limit it lower


[05-Jun-23 09:29 AM] churavis#0000
You have to upgrade the warehouse, every two upgrade increases the number of warehouses each player can rent


[05-Jun-23 09:31 AM] martin1194#0000
:/ i see. that why I can't set it to 2 for each player to let haven't base player can fulfill before ship arrives.

[05-Jun-23 02:43 PM] allocater#0000
2 more permits to make 250k more? sounds like a deal. HYF is producing more crops per base than FRM.


[05-Jun-23 02:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah but you have to subtract out Etherwind and ISA though


[05-Jun-23 02:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
prunplanner needs to work out the profit/revenue bit, haha


[05-Jun-23 02:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
so it's more like 291k vs 150k


[05-Jun-23 02:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you set the price of H2O to 0, and the Etherwind base will make $95,912 less and the water consuming planet will make $95,912 more.


[05-Jun-23 02:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
So it's just a matter of where you attribute the profit to in a vertically integrated system


[05-Jun-23 02:47 PM] allocater#0000
I would set it to market price and then cut the 2 bases with the least profit aka outsourcing it to the market (if volume allows)

less water but more NS


[05-Jun-23 02:55 PM] allocater#0000
less shipping demand


[05-Jun-23 02:55 PM] allocater#0000
also with water at 50 maybe profitability even switched to MUS


[05-Jun-23 02:55 PM] rune_242#0000
and shipping is EX-PEN-SIVE


[05-Jun-23 02:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
but it's only maybe 40t/d


[05-Jun-23 02:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
and you have to make 1 more HYF to cover the loss of efficiency


[05-Jun-23 02:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
for equal RATs


[05-Jun-23 03:03 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
I plan to make SE-110b into Ag (HYF) and SE-110d into FP, they're the same system as Ice Station Alpha


[05-Jun-23 03:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
HYF makes 24 MUS / day. It replaces BEA, made in a farm at 10.5 BEA / day. The HYF is half the area. So it's 4x the RAT components per area per day. NS is pretty cheap and easy. Having MUS in your rotation can allow you to fine tune your HYF water consumption if needed, which is nice.  (swapping off CAF usually).


[05-Jun-23 03:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
I haven't really been into ALG. It's a lot of water for a pretty small time savings. Someone could do the math but I suspect the water shipping isn't worth the trouble for ALG over MUS.

but imagine the economic boom when new players instantly build new bases, instead of being stuck for 2 months


[15-Jun-23 11:41 AM] exeler#0000
100%

For us that is amazing, but for a player looking to enjoy the early stages of the game and use that early period to learn how things work maybe they'd prefer not to. 

If they join the corp, those corp dividends actually are a pretty decent booster, and socializing with the corp members and seeing a niche they can fill might also convince them that "a loan is okay"


[15-Jun-23 11:54 AM] hernanduer#0000

You end it  yourself

ah, i see.
thanks for all the help.


[18-Jun-23 07:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, it gives you the quantity and price for each person, so it's easy to send a bunch in a row through APEX


[19-Jun-23 02:21 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
"Auction" is a misnomer, since it's not a bidding system and winner-takes-all. It's more of a collective "Equal Share" disbursement. But once you run one it's easy to understand.


[19-Jun-23 02:22 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Though, as usual, it's also easy to mess up the contracts, and having to fix 5-10 contracts all at once is a mini-game I know I play often.

With a lot of more experienced players retiring, the landscape for long-time players is changing. I think it makes sense to reach out to them again. I think new players who are joining now are also a bit different than folks to joined a year ago, although it's hard to articulate how

I can supply both, I can also give you an overview of all of the bases I had that feed the 3 SPF

Or just let it increase your electronics multiplier


[29-Jun-23 10:13 AM] hernanduer#0000
well, that's actually part of the plan. I'm only using phobos for a single CLR to make NCS. <100 area. Need to do _something_ with it


[29-Jun-23 10:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
also @habix3956 has been missing for a bit, so I might need to make a TIO base...


[29-Jun-23 10:19 AM] churavis#0000
I seem to remember someone else asking me for a regular supply of NCS, more than I could provide since my electronics base is full

Hello everyone! I'm letting you know that I will be retiring from the game in the near future. I've had a great time playing with you all, but other aspects in my life require more of my attention and I've been losing interest in the game. As far as in-game, my main contributions to the corp have been NS, some SCA items, and keeping Harmonia up and running. I'll put my thoughts and notes for Harmonia in the Politics thread. Otherwise, expect some fire sales over the next couple of weeks including NS on Harmonia/ZV-639d, C on Nascent, and TCS on Nike as well as all the miscellaneous items I have stockpiled over time.

I think it's not just another reset needed but seeing more of the features that are on the roadmap from the devs, they're just tinkering and it feels like they have less than a fulltime dev on it. No one seemed to be asking for the rating stuff they've spent the last months on.


[13-Jul-23 10:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, development has been really slow, especially for "new things to do". Since I started... Faction Contracts were a bust- ship upgrades were great but not groundbreaking. And private contracts. That's it for my 450 days of play


[13-Jul-23 10:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think they need something larger like: player built orbital somethings... asteroid mining... electricity/energy system... or a political rework larger than "governors get separate wallets"


[13-Jul-23 10:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
that being said, I'm optimistic about the upcoming release

I just released a new update for the auction bot! Sorry for ignoring the project for a month üòÖ

If you've already bid on an auction, hitting bid again will cancel your bid so you can undo misclicks easily.

There's also a new button to change the maximum amount of your bid.

So if someone starts an auction for say, 18 FSE, and you only need one you can update your bid to only request one and the bot will respect that when the auction is finialized. This feature was contributed by @martin1194  who's MR sat patiently waiting for nearly a month while I didn't look at it. Sorry again for the wait

The bidders list will now display the effective maximum request for every bidder. The format is "<username>: Up to <max amount>". This defaults to the entire amount of the auction but can be updated to a different amount after a bid is made.

To go along with :this:  I just put up some auctions for items (Construction mats, hull plates, and OFF) that I've not done auctions for in the past because I thought the chances someone wanted that many of the item would be low. But now that you can set a max, feel free to bid for just the amount you want/need üòÑ

Is there any disadvantage to slightly overcrowding workers if there's no space for a Hab? For example, you're like 5 capacity for pioneers short.


[18-Jul-23 02:23 PM] melon164#0000
you'll get a proportionate slowdown


[18-Jul-23 02:24 PM] melon164#0000
so if you need 1000 PIOs but you only build habs for 900, your PIO efficiency will be multiplied by 90%


[18-Jul-23 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, it's often fine to run a few short. Especially something like orchards, whihc use 70 settlers and 10 technicians. Not gonna build a hab for 10 people


[18-Jul-23 02:46 PM] melon164#0000
If your agriculture planet even _has_ ten TECs


[18-Jul-23 06:05 PM] churavis#0000
Just remember that the slower efficiency compounds when combined with other multipliers, so losing 10% efficiency in workers ends up with 16% less efficiency than what you could have otherwise, assuming full experts and COGC bonus

Is there any FAQ to start a base in a zero-population planet?

pretty straightforward, it just takes a little while. You get a happiness boost for the first 4 or 5 weeks to promote faster migration, but otherwise it's just waiting

no need to build any thing? just make sure it have some stuffs to up keep?


[19-Jul-23 09:26 PM] churavis#0000
It depends on the tier of workers you need


[19-Jul-23 09:29 PM] martin1194#0000
just pioneer


[19-Jul-23 09:30 PM] churavis#0000
You get 200 for free, if you need more super fast then maybe build SST


[19-Jul-23 09:30 PM] martin1194#0000
These 200 no need up keep at 0lv SST?


[19-Jul-23 09:32 PM] churavis#0000
One base produces enough life support for more pioneers than you can use but not enough to produce a ton of natural growth


[19-Jul-23 09:57 PM] martin1194#0000
um, let me repeat what I understand. if it had mistake, please correct me. aAlso my gramma : P
If i never put upkeep in Population Infrastructure, i can still have 200 pioneers if my base have upkeep.
But if need more than 200 pioneers, I need to put upkeep in 0Lv Safety Station. Am I correct?


[19-Jul-23 09:58 PM] churavis#0000
Without any infrastructure or ADM, you'll have 200, plus a slight increase every week


[19-Jul-23 10:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
With no infrastructure and a single base, you can eventually support >= 400 pioneers


[20-Jul-23 03:03 AM] martin1194#0000

If a planet is unnamed currently, you can name it by donating extra money up to the Star level and then messaging Molp. There are also occasional events where they allow everyone to vote on a planet to name and then hold another vote to choose the name

Man, that's on me for putting my hand up, lol


[30-Jul-23 12:53 PM] emperyan11#0000
Not opposed .. but how time consuming would that be?


[30-Jul-23 12:54 PM] emperyan11#0000
And would I need a base there?


[30-Jul-23 12:55 PM] churavis#0000
You don't need a base there, you mostly just need to monitor the population and set a calendar reminder to make sure the COGC and infrastructure are funded, plus the occasional program if necessary, which we can reimburse you for.


[30-Jul-23 12:57 PM] churavis#0000
If you did put a base on Demeter there would be plenty who would buy your crops or water


[30-Jul-23 12:58 PM] emperyan11#0000
Could use a garden station tbh... free up some space on Deimos for more smelting / prefabs


[30-Jul-23 12:59 PM] emperyan11#0000

[30-Jul-23 06:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly planets that are mostly pioneers are almost no work at all. Demeter is sitting at 18.8% safety and 30% health and it's doing fine. Ignore the POPI entirely and run the festival 3, and it will be totally fine. Or only provide DW, which is fairly cheap. Bring in a few basics for COGC. A shipful of goodies keep it stocked for many months at a time. This is what Demeter needs each week for the COGC

[30-Jul-23 09:56 PM] sage42#0000

[30-Jul-23 09:57 PM] churavis#0000
If we have someone willing to take on the responsibility, yes. The new governor seems to frugile to be able to do a good job


[30-Jul-23 09:58 PM] sage42#0000
Right now I can't even keep my bases running all the time, but I should have more shipping capacity by next election, I could take it on if needed.


[30-Jul-23 10:10 PM] higgsy#0000
I don't anticipate Harmonia getting upkept well with caskman as governer. GTU is based around MOR and far more de-centralized than OOG.


[31-Jul-23 10:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah there's no program running there also


[31-Jul-23 10:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
I mean maybe that's not necessary on Harmonia, but I find it pretty effective


[31-Jul-23 10:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's still sailing on Erix's contributions too, very little added by the new governor

harmonia's gotta play at least a part


[31-Jul-23 09:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think the recent decline is largely from Harmonia. Demeter didn't add anything to taxes  and I think that's all we lost


[31-Jul-23 09:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's nice someone else increased the taxes on harmonia for us, once we retake it üòõ


[31-Jul-23 09:56 PM] archielvahr#0000

no real public metrics for that

Hey, I just wanted to check up on a few folks who are still in the corp but seem to be inactive:

@dehzhas  @sginga  
@yuen8241  @namthorn 

I wanted to let you all know about the new update, in case you missed it. And see if you were interested in returning to the game or adding your accumulated dividend cash to either the OOG bank, the CORPARC, or your personal apex representation center. Or just let us know if you're definitely done for this universe too. (It will help me know if we should step up recruiting). Thanks!


[03-Aug-23 07:24 AM] namthorn#0000
I think I'm done for this universe.  Is there someone I can send my cash to to distribute accordingly?


[03-Aug-23 07:29 AM] namthorn#0000
Or I can just dump it in the corparc if the bank has too much cash to know what to do with already


[03-Aug-23 09:30 AM] archielvahr#0000
Either allocater or the corp arc. Allocater can always dump it in the arc if we want to

A loan is also an option rather than a flat out gift. I was also in the camp of not accepting handouts early, but a loan applies some pressure to grow that the game otherwise doesn't have.

No. Cheap as chips


[07-Aug-23 04:02 AM] melon164#0000
I think a week's worth of a 20√óIDC base produces about 80 SNM?  I don't really need that many though, more like 20 or 30?


[07-Aug-23 05:15 AM] domicius#0000
Hahaha.... No. Not 80 SNM


[07-Aug-23 05:16 AM] domicius#0000
2 SNM takes 36 hours.


[07-Aug-23 05:17 AM] domicius#0000
IDC takes 18 Hours.


[07-Aug-23 05:20 AM] domicius#0000
And you need 1 WAI for each SNM and 1 IMM, 36 hrs and 27 hrs


[07-Aug-23 05:20 AM] domicius#0000
All this at 132% efficiency


[07-Aug-23 05:22 AM] domicius#0000
I do, however, have a stockpile of the necessary materials and can make you the required SNM.


[07-Aug-23 05:23 AM] domicius#0000
I mean, if someone has a base that is just SL and has the inputs it can go faster.  A 20x IDC daily base could do it... That's 15 SLs though


[07-Aug-23 05:23 AM] domicius#0000
Anyway...


[07-Aug-23 05:27 AM] domicius#0000
Hmmmm.... With a bit of investment I could actually build another 5 SLs and pump out IDC. The bottleneck for WAI though is the SDs


[07-Aug-23 05:28 AM] domicius#0000
Didn't mean to be rude BTW. Was just surprised by the calculations.  Making t
SNM is pretty involved.


[07-Aug-23 09:06 AM] allocater#0000
I have it on malahat, also EDC bases are there, so you can use it as a production chain


[07-Aug-23 09:11 AM] allocater#0000
gotta bring a lot of SA SAL NF LD though, so maybe it's easier to slow-buy SNM from domicius


[07-Aug-23 09:12 AM] allocater#0000
or NV1 from me, unless you want NV2


[07-Aug-23 09:15 AM] domicius#0000
I mean, it's only slow because I'm mostly engaged making WAI and SNM for Allocater üòÇ.  But if I don't make IDC for a while, I should be able to crank it out in a couple of weeks. Let me know, anyway.

I can already set up the NN contracts to me, depending on which of the 4 SE bases will participate


[07-Aug-23 02:39 PM] allocater#0000
@sage42 @neth_havoc @draconisdomini who wants to produce 10 NN?


[07-Aug-23 02:43 PM] draconisdomini#0000
I doesn't make much difference to me what my Malahat base is producing.  If you give me the inputs I'm happy to make some NN

[07-Aug-23 02:44 PM] allocater#0000

Roger.  Send me contracts for the inputs melon and I'll get those in production

[07-Aug-23 02:55 PM] allocater#0000
Archiel will also need inputs for 10 NN, so we have 20/30 planned


[07-Aug-23 02:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's such a small difference for HPR to HYR, I figure it's always better to make that jump. Especially since with an LCB, it's 1.2ps/h, a 35% faster ship...


[07-Aug-23 02:59 PM] allocater#0000
30 DV we can also already start, that leaves inputs for 30 DA and 30 DD


[07-Aug-23 03:07 PM] martin1194#0000
looking for PWO


[07-Aug-23 09:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
Did anyone else listen to the livestream? They announced player constructible space stations for the next update (although they haven't really started on it)


[07-Aug-23 10:07 PM] churavis#0000
I did, not only player constructable space stations but also space elevators within the next year


[07-Aug-23 10:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah, did they say what Space Elevators did? I had to stop midway through


[07-Aug-23 10:08 PM] churavis#0000
The most explanation they gave was: "players can imagine what they would do"


[07-Aug-23 10:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
ü§î


[07-Aug-23 10:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mean.. I can


[07-Aug-23 10:09 PM] churavis#0000
And that it would be a material benefit


[07-Aug-23 10:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
We have plenty of things without material benefit, so that's good üòÑ


[07-Aug-23 10:09 PM] churavis#0000
I imagine it would mean you can skip the landing and takeoff phase of a journey to the planet


[08-Aug-23 12:02 AM] domicius#0000
That would save a bunch of fuel.


[08-Aug-23 12:03 AM] churavis#0000
It would save time and damage, especially on some planets


[08-Aug-23 08:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
the space stations would be so nice


[08-Aug-23 08:18 AM] churavis#0000
What do you assume they would do?


[08-Aug-23 08:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
we can just post our corp priced items there, finally. Not sure it was next update though, sounds like next was translations


[08-Aug-23 08:19 AM] churavis#0000
They said it would be within the year


[08-Aug-23 08:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
right, so 4 updates


[08-Aug-23 08:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
space elevators will be cool too, not sure how it will work as its a public/private partnership or even entirely privately owned


[08-Aug-23 08:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
sounds like they'll need new boundaries on interactions that don't currently exist


[08-Aug-23 08:20 AM] hernanduer#0000
also might be unintentional nerf to somewhere like promitor, since I assume it'll take a plot of land and they're all out


[08-Aug-23 08:21 AM] churavis#0000
They also mentioned that they were going to update politics so that planetary governments would get their own accounts to recieve taxes and then pay out contracts to build infrastructure to players


[08-Aug-23 08:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, and to stock infrastructure too


[08-Aug-23 08:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
not sure about the legislature though, they didn't seem to know much about that one


[08-Aug-23 08:21 AM] hernanduer#0000
yet


[08-Aug-23 08:22 AM] churavis#0000
They also said they were planning on dropping the one governorship per player rule so that will be nice


[08-Aug-23 08:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
definitely


[08-Aug-23 08:23 AM] hernanduer#0000
let's see how long it takes for someone to get voted in as governor for all of a faction's core worlds


[08-Aug-23 08:24 AM] churavis#0000
The big world's are usually quite coveted but I could definitely see some enterprising individuals with a dozen governorships of mostly small, sparsely populated worlds where no one else wants the responsibility


[08-Aug-23 08:26 AM] draconisdomini#0000
I would guess space elevators would work like the other planetary infrastructure.  Perhaps like the warehouse in needing to be expanded to increase shipment capacity


[09-Aug-23 01:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
so... much... CHEMISTRY


[09-Aug-23 01:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
my new plan is to basically pick up my Griff base's 8 LABs, move those to into 10 LABs Elon, and pick all my 10 CHP and 8 POL on Elon and move them to a new base on Electronica. Then make Griff into 6 AML + 1 EEP


[09-Aug-23 01:31 PM] hernanduer#0000
then I can move into engine production


[09-Aug-23 01:33 PM] hernanduer#0000
but maybe Elon is better suited for AML + EEP? the population charts are interesting


[09-Aug-23 02:05 PM] churavis#0000
I make MG on Elon so if you want to save some space then you can buy it from me and get a bulk discount.


[09-Aug-23 02:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'd still have to have the EXT for AUO extraction


[09-Aug-23 02:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
but thanks


[09-Aug-23 02:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
think I'll do 5 AML + 1 EEP on Elon, 1 AML + 10 LAB on Griff, it's an interesting setup, requires fewer changes though


[09-Aug-23 02:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
then a PHF even fits on Elon


[09-Aug-23 04:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
I need 10 BAI and 10 MLI to make my 10 NN on Malahat - @melon164 The DV I am making are almost done

[10-Aug-23 11:00 AM] melon164#0000
I see, that's why you rejected mine

I was looking to sell higher tier prefabs since they're my money maker at the moment. Is it a good market?


[11-Aug-23 11:20 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, but only if you can make your own inputs. That's the hard part and the reason they aren't cheaper.


[11-Aug-23 11:22 PM] higgsy#0000
I make EPO, AL, FLX, and C. Just running low on EPO until I expand.


[11-Aug-23 11:22 PM] churavis#0000
RSE uses so much EPO, it's ridiculous

Relaxing doesn't make you sick, jet lagged lack of sleep and unhealthy travel food make you sick

definitely the lack of sleep that time, didn't sleep well leading up to it. Then the fever gave me a resting heart rate of 90, gl going to sleep with that

Hello! everyone. I'm here to find someone who need to long-term buy SME stuff.
now, I long term export AL to 2 members in Ooga.
feel free to ask if want to export SME stuff in the future.


[14-Aug-23 07:53 PM] hernanduer#0000

about 100/d


[14-Aug-23 07:54 PM] martin1194#0000

no worries, I'll take anything extra, preferably delivered on ANT

Deimos only uses about 20/d for me

so ANT is easier access for moving it around

goodluck 

[14-Aug-23 08:38 PM] fremen45#0000

[14-Aug-23 10:13 PM] higgsy#0000
My Deimos is full AL and a bit of STL prod. Any AL not going to Nike is auctioned off on ANT. I'll update the spreadsheet at a later date.

The market ran out, it might still be worth it


[15-Aug-23 07:53 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, I've got a base with a couple of buildings on it that's overproducing HE. If we need more, I can scale up like 10X without needing another permit.

I've got 950 on ANT right now. Send me a contract for however much you want, just make up a price. I basically print this stuff for free. 

If you need more, I've got 3.5k just waiting at the source I can ship in.

dayum, I only saw hortus and already dumped 15k


[18-Aug-23 12:51 PM] churavis#0000
He did make a mistake in not setting the prices to be the same all over, that presents and arbitrage opportunity for anyone with a free hauler


[18-Aug-23 12:52 PM] allocater#0000
or it's a trap, and when you buy on ANT, he will remove the hortus buy üòÑ


[18-Aug-23 12:52 PM] churavis#0000
If he removes the hortus buy then you can undercut his sell order

or he wants to move RAT and this is the way of paying for the transport üòÑ


[18-Aug-23 12:54 PM] churavis#0000
I'm quite certain a shipping order would have been simpler and cheaper

I haven't advertised it here since I was looking for a general broad spectrum of investors so it wasn't just an OOG thing, but I did offer an IPO. Several OOG members did invest, so I thought I would mention it in case anyone else wanted a piece of the action. This is probably the only time I will mention it here.

Wondering what the demand is around GL. I was considering putting in a GL base and wondering if there would be a market for that?


[29-Aug-23 05:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I will buy GL / RG / NG in moderate quantities. Like a few hundred GL per week, a hundred RG a week, and maybe 10 NG / week


[29-Aug-23 05:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mostly grab it off the CX now


[29-Aug-23 05:55 PM] churavis#0000

[30-Aug-23 08:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
interesting, but a single RDE is worth more than a single NN


[30-Aug-23 08:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
and I don't even mean on the market, I mean its input values are about 50% more


[30-Aug-23 08:38 AM] churavis#0000
NN mid CX price is about 30k, RDE mid CX price is about 20k


[30-Aug-23 08:38 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah but the CX doesn't move NNs, the input values on an NN are about 10k in workforce usage


[30-Aug-23 08:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
while the RDE input cost is about 15k, and that's with reduced prices from vertical scaling


[30-Aug-23 08:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
for selling to corp, I always look at input costs rather than market


[30-Aug-23 08:39 AM] churavis#0000
Price doesn't depend solely on input values, it depends on supply and demand


[30-Aug-23 08:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
right, but NN demand is super low


[30-Aug-23 08:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
apparently there was a single sale a couple weeks ago, then the next one was 10 units in April


[30-Aug-23 08:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
so CX is useless for it


[30-Aug-23 08:41 AM] churavis#0000
The price isn't much different in any other CX


[30-Aug-23 08:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah but price doesn't matter if no one buys it


[30-Aug-23 08:42 AM] churavis#0000
In any case, I'll give you the upgrade components for the 15 NN


[30-Aug-23 10:07 AM] fremen45#0000
Thanks. Where do you want the NN? I have it on Phobos currently.


[30-Aug-23 10:34 AM] churavis#0000

is there a reason that there is no governor on Electronica? it looks like @parisinspringtime was running it before. I know there has been talk of him taking over Deimos? but I'm not sure on the details of that situation.


[31-Aug-23 05:18 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I built the Admin building there and I used the planet to learn about governorship. I overdid things and the PIO population ballooned massively; that has slowly bled down to manageable levels.


[31-Aug-23 05:18 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I left the governorship because it's a small planet that doesn't need a governor to run programs; things can be maintained by feeding the consumables.
I built the extra SST & INF to ensure the above. I still feed those.


[31-Aug-23 05:18 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Some people decided a small baby planet like this was the perfect place to put high-POP buildings. That is their prerogative, but these same people won't feed the consumables required to build or maintain those POPs. I am no longer feeding for POPs I don't use for a planet I am not governor for. I already feed 4-6 other small bases as necessary. People need to take responsibility for their own decisions/goals.


[31-Aug-23 05:18 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Next POPR will:
- continue to bleed off PIOs. Goal is to get PIO unemployment to 10-15%.
-  clear the SET unemployment completely, leaving unemployment around 10%.
- help with the TECH shortfall with +75 TECH & +50% ENG POPs (this is an unintended improvement but I don't begrudge others the benefit they receive. However, if people want more TECH, ENG & SCI, they can put in the effort themselves).


[31-Aug-23 05:23 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Next cycle I will only be feeding the SST with OFF, which will maintain the PIO & SET populations pretty steadily (if someone adds low-POP buildings and eats the available unemployment, I'll revisit those levels). However, that will mean the TECH & ENG populations will fall. It's unfortunate but also not my problem.


[31-Aug-23 05:23 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
The buildings to build up and maintain those POPs already exist on the planet; others just need to feed them properly.


[31-Aug-23 09:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
I figure that's a good way to live by


[31-Aug-23 10:05 AM] churavis#0000
Wouldn't DW be cheaper and easier than OFF? A full upkeep category carries the same weight as any other.


[31-Aug-23 10:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
per market, OFF shows as cheapest


[31-Aug-23 10:27 AM] hernanduer#0000
even SUN is somehow cheaper than DW


[31-Aug-23 10:29 AM] exeler#0000
I also sell OFF regularly for better than market rates. 

I also can make SUN super cheap


[31-Aug-23 01:48 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
exactly this üëÜ


[31-Aug-23 01:48 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I buy cheap OFF from Exeler, and also now make my own SUN. I don't make enough DW yet to cover planet consumables.

these are my current costs for Electronica


[31-Aug-23 01:49 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
(were I to fulfil all 3 consumables on the SST)


[31-Aug-23 01:50 PM] churavis#0000
I suppose it depends on whether you can make it yourself and scale it up or not, it's quite easy for me to scale up DW but not OFF or SUN. Making it yourself is always cheaper than even corp rates.


[31-Aug-23 01:52 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
100% 
"something-something-opportunity-costs", but I agree with you that it's often cheaper (and more reliable) to make the things yourself.


[31-Aug-23 01:58 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I opened up a FP/FER base to handle the what I would have needed for Deimos: DW & FOD (+some extra DW, COF & ALE for my Empire)


[31-Aug-23 05:38 PM] exeler#0000
I'm pretty confident I can scale up OFF to provide for basically everyone in the corp that would need/want it. 

At 60/u it looks like Archiel's sheet shows OFF as one of the most cost effective inputs.

SE-648b is the other option for BER extraction, similar distance to ANT but has a COGC and everything else already built


[01-Sep-23 01:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
You could even run for governor there, we used to run it, but it's empty now


[01-Sep-23 01:33 PM] fremen45#0000
I was using the IY-206D for TAI and then plan was to feed them into electronica for aml processing which is like 1 jump away. Let me think about it. There is real advantages to moving to SE-648b but that‚Äôs a decent scale restructuring.


[01-Sep-23 01:55 PM] fremen45#0000
do we have Suppliers for BOR? the TAI tap is a minor loss for me. but at some point far in the future I very well might try to make engines and I would loose BOR production if I pull all 3 of those bases off the map.


[01-Sep-23 01:59 PM] exeler#0000
Sorry about the struggles with the auction bot recently. I did some more work on it this morning. 

If someone who has an open auction can try to finish it and let me know if it works as expected that would be lovely. I tested the auctions on my test server, but I suspect there's something off about the data/db currently live that might be tripping up the bot somehow. 

I want to get it back into a stable state before I start adding some of the new features I was planning. Hopefully over the weekend it'll become more than just the auction bot üôÇ


[01-Sep-23 02:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Looking at the LEAD for BOR, I don't think anyone in the corp is making it now. Most of those names aren't ANT people I think. Nike has a tiny bit.. probably not enough to be effective but it would be pretty convenient

out of curiosity what's the price per unit?


[01-Sep-23 02:13 PM] churavis#0000
As it says on the sheet, 20k each


[01-Sep-23 03:32 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I also make TSH, and unfortunately 20k is a good price for it, considering the cost of raw materials.

MCG is one of those things goods where the rate limit on how much money you can make from it is how many you can sell. 

So pretty much regardless of how much you need, someone will have it laying around and be itching to sell it.

Electronica could do with a governor. I cut my teeth as governor there and it was great. It's all gone a little downhill since I left. It's ticking along but could do with a program or two.


[06-Sep-23 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
So you'll definitely want a small planet, and one that is Pioneer focused, otherwise it would be a big challenge for a new player. And elections run for a week so... a 10 day timeline will be tough.


[06-Sep-23 10:53 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Would fit your window perfectly too.

Yuen is the only other OOG member with a base there, and he's inactive. So it will all come down to your vote, Paris üòõ


[06-Sep-23 10:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
What does the governor do exactly? Do I need to move building materials / supplies with ships?


[06-Sep-23 10:56 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Does anyone have/produce AEF? I've tapped out both Churavais' and my own stores, but I'm still 60 units short.


[06-Sep-23 10:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is it necessary to get at least one vote to get elected?


[06-Sep-23 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
Technically you don't need a base there, but you do need at least one vote.


[06-Sep-23 10:57 AM] parisinspringtime#0000

[06-Sep-23 10:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
The governor definitely needs to run programs. Usually they are responsible for upkeep, like filling the safety, health, etc ( see `POPID p-IY-028c t-SST` as an example)


[06-Sep-23 11:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I bet @melon164 would be happy to let you have that one


[06-Sep-23 11:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also KI-401a doesn't start with a deficit of 400 technicians.. which will be much easier on a new governor

Why is MAI better to produce on FRM than HYF?


[06-Sep-23 12:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
I only use FRM to make GRN and HER, because you can't use HYF


[06-Sep-23 12:42 PM] hernanduer#0000
everything a HYF makes is more expensive, just volume is greater


[06-Sep-23 12:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
so 2:1 farm:food planets, or with hyf it reverses, 1:3


[06-Sep-23 12:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's the true "(margin) quality < (volume)quantity" argument

[06-Sep-23 01:27 PM] exeler#0000
I use FRM for MAI because the HCP recipe for the HYF is just a lot better imo. So I make HCP, CAF and RCO in the HYF with MAI and GRN in the FRM.


[06-Sep-23 01:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I use HYF for MUS so I don't have to make BEA. I did the math once and convinced myself it was a good plan. I couldn't really rationalize it now

Hi folks! We have a lot of plans for what a future universe map could look like. However, to shake things up in the currently running universe, the topic of making changes to the map as it is right now came up quite a few times already.

[06-Sep-23 02:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think they liked my idea in the "behind the scenes" discord channel when I mentioned a "mysterious subspace anomaly" upgrading existing planets, and that seems to be the direction discussion is going


[06-Sep-23 02:32 PM] pateirn#0000
Yeah, I wanna think about it a bit more, but that was basically an idea I had.


[06-Sep-23 02:33 PM] pateirn#0000
I don't think it should be possible to have a system of all garbage. Maybe some sort of tiered procgen, where you get something good, maybe a few medium, and then a few truly randoms


[06-Sep-23 02:34 PM] pateirn#0000
But just hand upgrading a bunch of stuff near the active zones as a band-aid for this wipe seems very reasonable


[06-Sep-23 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, I like that idea too.


[06-Sep-23 02:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect they will do a procedural change to planets away from the core


[06-Sep-23 02:38 PM] pateirn#0000
Yeah, I like that. And I feel like anyone who did get affected by that, could be Admin spawned stuff at a cx, because it would just affect so few people

It would only last for a short time, though


[06-Sep-23 02:41 PM] pateirn#0000
And I feel like Terraforming would fit in very nicely with this. Maybe a special ship module to do terraforming, and specific mats would facilitate that process? Makes turning a whole system into something useful possible


[06-Sep-23 02:42 PM] pateirn#0000
Sure, but then we have those planets to use still, maybe too much work for a feature like that


[06-Sep-23 02:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
don't get too excited here, it takes them 3 months to implement some rather basic changes due to low manpower

terraformers, warp gates, all these kinds of changes are interesting but way out of scope


[06-Sep-23 02:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think they'll only rerun procedural generation on some sectors/systems, manually fix some old bugs (like weird system naming that doesn't match sectors), and then maybe manually add some special planets


[06-Sep-23 02:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
and maybe add a CX somewhere in the south

They're much less frequent now that they've added stability improvements and measures to protect against data corruption.


[06-Sep-23 02:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
asteroids seem like the next trigger for a wipe though, just way too much change to incorporate here

Minor update for the auction bot (unless you're a database nerd, then this might be mildly interesting): The database schema is now under proper version control (for the nerds: using a tool called alembic).

No noticable change in behavior is expected, but this means a huuuge amount of pain translating data to support new features is gone now (I committed many sins to add a new column to the DB and backfill it with data from the discord api last time). I'm hoping to add some cool new things to the bot soon so stay tuned!


[08-Sep-23 01:31 AM] exeler#0000
Related to :this: 

I'm working on a new `order` feature for the bot. It'll function like a reverse auction. I want it to be useful for coordinating large orders of MATs for base building, collecting ship comments for a ship build, or just requesting a huge volume of a specific good to be filled by multiple people.

I wanted to use a discord modal to fill in multiple products you need... but discord modals suck and it looks like I can't do that üò†

So instead, it looks like it's one item per modal, but at that rate I might as well just use inputs to the slash command like how `/auction` works.

Would you guys rather the `/order` command takes the first (only?) item as a modal (the command would just be /order with no arguments) or have it work like `/auction` and take all the numbers at once with no secondary pop up to type stuff into.

I've attached a screenshot of what the modal would look like (since I went and wasted my time writing the code to build it üòÖ)

[08-Sep-23 01:50 AM] melon164#0000
Assuming you're passing the input to some sort of programming language, could you do string parsing of an input like `108xABH@40000,72xADE@20000,3xADS@100000` to get the multiple items?  First split by `,` to get the different items, then split each item by `@` to get the price and rest, then split the rest by `x` (please support `√ó` also if you do that or I will be sad!) to get quantity and item?


[08-Sep-23 01:51 AM] melon164#0000
If it really is restricted to one order at a time then the slash command is probably faster/easier to input into


[08-Sep-23 02:59 AM] exeler#0000
That's really easy to do in code, but I wonder if the typical humans driving the bot would find it intuitive to stuff all of that into discord's sad excuse for a text input control üòÖ 

I forsee a lot of "Aaaah! I forgot the x" or "Aaaah! I typod one of them" with that since not everyone is a data entry expert.

I'm thinking the slash command and one-per-order is a good workaround. It's quick, keyboard only, and discord has support for some rudimentary typing that helps correct some typos nicely. The modals are really bad when it comes to UX imo.


[08-Sep-23 03:02 AM] exeler#0000
Progress so far. I want to add a "Fulfill some" button that will hit you with a box to type in how many you want instead of doing them all (or in this specific example, one less than the max so I could test the "x remaining items needed" logic)

Back to the ship build naming that was going on recently, could we support something like that? Tell the bot you want a hyper carrier and it spits out a big list of all the items you need? Would be ship specific; if you wanted regular items you have to go one item at a time. Would also need some reference to know what each ship name does


[08-Sep-23 08:53 AM] pateirn#0000
This is a kick ass idea if it is possible!


[08-Sep-23 12:21 PM] exeler#0000
Oh yeah!

If we had premade configurations it would be really easy to do that!

After the basic command is working, I'm gonna look into setting up something like that


[08-Sep-23 01:01 PM] higgsy#0000
Is there a demand for PPF goods within OOG? Like, do y'all need PSL, PSM, and PSS?


[08-Sep-23 01:04 PM] higgsy#0000
Also, which infrastructure items are needed? I'm not well-versed in govt stuff yet.


[08-Sep-23 01:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect PSL/PSM/PSS and the DCL/DCM/DCS are mostly made by the people who consume them. I make my own, at least.


[08-Sep-23 01:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Personally I think there's a growing market for some of the weirder POPI items like STR, PFE, UTS... maybe DEC, FOD, SUN


[08-Sep-23 01:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the two factors that would need research are: 1) What's the $/Satisfaction and 2) what's your profit margin for that


[08-Sep-23 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
if cheap HOGs become available, they will get used, but I don't know the component cost offhand


[08-Sep-23 01:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Here's a chart of $ / Satisfaction at the AI1 prices I have listed:

How much are PAR's used? I looked at DEC a while back and the volume seemed very low.


[08-Sep-23 03:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
DECs are very expensive for PARs, it's sort of a last result, but I have been known to use them. They also fit in ARTs, which is convenient


[08-Sep-23 03:05 PM] mrsmith33#0000

Better question is what habitation modules are used there to fit into 500 area?


[08-Sep-23 05:14 PM] mrsmith33#0000
5 HBB + 2 HB2 seems to be the best


[08-Sep-23 05:29 PM] mrsmith33#0000
`YI-705c` seems to be better than `ZV-759d` for EPO


[08-Sep-23 05:30 PM] higgsy#0000
I've got 750 on Griff: 10 EXT, 15 CP. There are lots of chemistry planets around so the next base is gonna be an EPO/PG one with imports from Griff


[08-Sep-23 05:30 PM] higgsy#0000
Buuut, I'm still working on balancing.


[08-Sep-23 05:31 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Are mixed habitation modules better that non-mixed?


[08-Sep-23 05:31 PM] higgsy#0000
Yes


[08-Sep-23 05:33 PM] higgsy#0000
I build as many HBB until either the PIO or SET are all housed, then build HB1 or HB2 to house the rest.


[08-Sep-23 05:36 PM] mrsmith33#0000

[08-Sep-23 06:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's exactly 500 area, 5 HB1, 5 HB2. It's before the habitat changes, and the base ones are cheaper. And it has 2 STO


[08-Sep-23 06:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 8 POL, it slightly overproduces HAL and CL


[08-Sep-23 06:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
2 STO is overkill there, but I put at least one on every base because it enables me to be lazy üòÑ

Hey @parisinspringtime  and @fremen45  I think both of you have ended up with corp tags (HI and SS1) that were previously used by another player. As a result, your data doesn't show up in FIO and in my spreadsheets. If possible, can you try resetting your FIO data on this page? Click the "Reset My Data" button.... that's assuming you have FIO accounts set up already. https://fio.fnar.net/settings


[10-Sep-23 10:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you don't have one, I will talk to Saganaki about how we can fix that. (I think he can remove the old player's accounts)


[11-Sep-23 01:19 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
You are correct and this did cause a problem when I was registering places, including UFO, FIO and certain Discords - I've reset my data twice now and my FIO data is pulling through to another Discord successfully. I'd appreciate not resetting again and having to set up all my stuff again if possible.

Where are you sourcing your C from? The corp can help with H and MG but C will be more difficult.


[12-Sep-23 09:35 AM] mrsmith33#0000
big question, lol


[12-Sep-23 09:46 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I guess I should build C base first


[12-Sep-23 09:46 AM] mrsmith33#0000
What are the planets for that?


[12-Sep-23 09:48 AM] churavis#0000
Crops for burning aren't available in large quantities either but water is so you'll want to build an agricultural base on Harmonia or Demeter and then a C burning base on Nascent. I also extract ALO on Nascent to free up space on Deimos. Use the slow burning recipe as farms take up more space than incinerators. MAI grows slightly faster but is heavier to transport


[12-Sep-23 10:13 AM] churavis#0000
If you need a loan to pay for all these bases all at once then talk to Allocater on the back channel. You'll want to build things quick to take advantage of the high pg prices before they inevitably go down again.


[12-Sep-23 10:32 AM] churavis#0000
You could probably make more C than you need right now and sell it at a good margin while prices are high and use it for future expansion if prices ever go down.


[12-Sep-23 10:42 AM] mrsmith33#0000
So, GRN or HCP?


[12-Sep-23 10:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
sizing of FPs frustrates me


[12-Sep-23 10:43 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Also, there are recipes with 1, 2, 4 water


[12-Sep-23 10:51 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Harmonia 13xFRM
```
        H2O OUTPUT
GRN  -40.42 161.67
GRN -215.56 215.56
HCP  -80.84 161.67
MAI  -57.74 173.22
```


[12-Sep-23 11:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Got pretty close numbers
```
Harmonia 13xFRM+1xRIG max experts
-189.06xH2O +215.56xGRN
Nascent 33xINC max experts
-211.86xGRN +211.86xC
```


[12-Sep-23 11:20 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Or I can remove 1 HB1 and add 1STO. This will be 20 Pioneer deficit. Gives `-208.65xGRN +208.65xC`


[12-Sep-23 11:21 AM] pateirn#0000
From my knowledge, HCP+GRN, HCP+MAI, and the recipe with all 3 are the best (the last one juices speed for production cost)


[12-Sep-23 11:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
that depends on if you're short INC space or Agri space. Agri space tends to be more difficult to find


[12-Sep-23 11:23 AM] pateirn#0000
Okay, I am still building out and very interested in this discussion. Let's say 2 bases feeding INC (harm, demeter and nascent). What is the best math?


[12-Sep-23 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think you'd really go the HYF route, so I'd crank out HCP from HYFs on Harmonia


[12-Sep-23 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
my Demeter base is 2 ORC and 6 FRM


[12-Sep-23 11:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
so it's a matter of if you want to go all in on C production, or do you want to make foods too?


[12-Sep-23 11:25 AM] hernanduer#0000

[12-Sep-23 11:25 AM] hernanduer#0000

[12-Sep-23 11:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
you need a permit


[12-Sep-23 11:25 AM] emperyan11#0000
doesn't that just allow more bases?


[12-Sep-23 11:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
nope it increases base size


[12-Sep-23 11:26 AM] pateirn#0000
And to boost to 750 and 1000


[12-Sep-23 11:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
500, 750, 1k for 3 permits


[12-Sep-23 11:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
if you have the logistics though, probably better to make a new base


[12-Sep-23 11:26 AM] emperyan11#0000

33 INCs with MAI and HCP


[12-Sep-23 11:31 AM] hernanduer#0000
gets you 316 C/d, and uses I think 14 HYFs


[12-Sep-23 11:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
17 HYF


[12-Sep-23 11:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
so that's only two bases netting you >300C/d


[12-Sep-23 11:33 AM] hernanduer#0000
and a little space for some CAF farming or something


[12-Sep-23 11:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
might want another STO on Nascent though with that, 500 in, 700 out/d is a LOT lol

some are building dependent, but the general order is unchanging

you can basically ignore BL and MGC

[12-Sep-23 11:54 AM] churavis#0000
Trust me, do the slow recipe. If you're able to buy more burnables or the price of C is super high then you can temporarily use the faster recipe, but you can't really depends on the CX for crops and fertile planets are in short supply.

Send me a contract for the PSL. Put up LM ads on Nike for everything else in chunks of no more than 1000 for the MCG and 50 for anything else. Start with the one base first and build up inputs for the next one before you move on.


[12-Sep-23 01:43 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Do I post SEA on LM too?


[12-Sep-23 01:54 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Posted SEA in chunks of 100 to Nike

We've got upgrade kits to make them haulers with 3kt/1kv

I am wondering if there is need or interest in acquiring CLI? none on ANT yet but seeing if there are interested buyers?


[13-Sep-23 12:51 AM] exeler#0000
The auction bot got a new feature: A `/order` command for requesting items rather than providing them.

It works similarly to the `/auction` command, just you're asking for items at a specific price in a specific place. Other people can choose to fulfill the whole order, or just a portion of it. 

Hopefully the command and buttons are fairly intuitive, especially if you've been using the auction command already. As usualy though, if there'ss any questions let me know!

Also, if there's any feedback on how the command might be improved, let me know. This was put together pretty quickly, so if there's a way I can make it better I'd love to hear it!

What does Finish button do on auctions?


[13-Sep-23 12:58 AM] exeler#0000
It only works if you're the one who started the auction. 

You press it when you're ready to distribute the goods and the bot will calculate how much each person who put in a bid will get. It'll also calculate the total cost for each bidder so that it's easy to put in the contracts


[13-Sep-23 12:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I guess there is no way to hide this button for other users?


[13-Sep-23 01:00 AM] exeler#0000

[13-Sep-23 05:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Looks like 2k/2k is better on some bases. On others 3kt is slightly better


[13-Sep-23 08:46 AM] churavis#0000
For upgrading starter ships, you'll want to do a hauler. The 2kt/2kv carrier upgrade is much more expensive since it requires a bigger crew quarters and more besides. Two haulers will be enough for 3 bases even if they're not optimal.


[13-Sep-23 08:46 AM] mrsmith33#0000
ok, how much is the hauler?


[13-Sep-23 08:47 AM] churavis#0000
You'll have to ask the ship building channel as I don't produce WCB

[15-Sep-23 11:22 AM] hernanduer#0000
@exeler maybe for the requests, there be a possibility to counter as well at a different price point? Then a button to accept it that's only clickable by the request owner


[15-Sep-23 11:28 AM] exeler#0000
I think that the limitation there would be implementing a way for the request owner to accept/reject the counter offers. 

Discord doesn't really have a way to put lots of buttons onto a message. So ideally I'd love to have a little accept/reject button next to each counter offer, but that doesn't seem possible with discord unless there's a new message per counteroffer. I suppose the bot could DM counteroffers to the request owner who could then approve/reject them ü§î 

I think for now just starting a normal conversation with the owner for a counteroffer might be easier. I'll take a look at adding a cleaner counteroffer option though.


[15-Sep-23 11:29 AM] hernanduer#0000
ahhh, yeah that's what I was kind of picturing. Shame that's not possible then, but you're right, conversation would probably just be easier at that point


[15-Sep-23 11:31 AM] churavis#0000
DMs would be preferred so as to not clutter up the auctions channel


[15-Sep-23 11:32 AM] exeler#0000
Yeah, discord's commands and modals are limited pretty heavily when it comes to cramming lots of buttons and input fields together. Unfortunately PU is a game about lots of little UI components crammed together üòÖ


[15-Sep-23 11:34 AM] exeler#0000
Related to cluttering up the auctions channel, I was wondering if we should keep /order usage out of there. 

Doing order requests manually, we've been putting "Looking for X" type messages into the planet channels where they're relevant. Perhaps we could do the same with /order? Although it could get buried under normal conversation. 

Should we add a #orders channel for requesting items?


[15-Sep-23 11:34 AM] exeler#0000
Or is having auctions and orders mixed together fine?


[15-Sep-23 11:35 AM] hernanduer#0000
maybe once an order is filled it can be blanked out as a message?


[15-Sep-23 11:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
but keep it in auctions


[15-Sep-23 11:36 AM] hernanduer#0000
that's just my opinion - if it takes up less space once resolved I'd be fine with keeping it there


[15-Sep-23 11:38 AM] exeler#0000
ü§î 

I could have the bot clean up completed orders and auctions after a while (maybe a week or so?)

It can't clean up the messages immediately because people need to read the final state to send out contracts, but I do think some kind of eventual cleanup would be handy. 

That way it's easy to see all the active auctions with just a few scrolls.

[15-Sep-23 11:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
the auctions I'm happy with, but isn't the person fulfilling the request the one sending the contract?


[15-Sep-23 11:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
so they don't need to see anything except the person to send the contract to


[15-Sep-23 11:46 AM] churavis#0000
Maybe make an archive channel for finished auctions/orders?

[15-Sep-23 11:53 AM] dehzhas#0000
This would actually work amazingly well. It would keep all the active ones in one place but all the history would be there if you needed it.


[15-Sep-23 02:22 PM] exeler#0000
The bot also has the auctions stored in a database. We wouldn't need them stored in discord channels at all. 

Could retrieve them on demand if you were looking for something. 

I also have some wild plans to make a webpage for the bot so get around discord's UI limitations a bit.


[16-Sep-23 01:01 AM] fremen45#0000

Would it make sense to have an optional ending date of auctions? This way bidders would know when to expect the contract

they were originally going to be timed, but really it's just gonna happen when it happens


[18-Sep-23 03:43 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'd say don't expect the auctions to ever finish by a certain time

because no matter what the person is gonna have to get on to make the contracts

I found that FEO transport cost is higher than ALO.
Seem not good for PP1 to make B's prefab.


[25-Sep-23 01:57 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Does PP1 even make sense? I am doing every bfab in PP2

[25-Sep-23 03:14 AM] rune_242#0000
I have 5 PP1 making BDE


[25-Sep-23 03:47 AM] domicius#0000
Same


[25-Sep-23 08:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
since I don't have any PP1s, BDE are actually the only prefab I don't make üò¥


[25-Sep-23 08:31 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I rarely produce BDEs, mostly BSE, BBH, BTA, LDE


[25-Sep-23 08:32 AM] churavis#0000
AL has been more expensive than FE on the CX for weeks. Judging by prices at all the other markets, it's going to stay that way for a while longer.


[25-Sep-23 08:39 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm doing my own AL on Deimos, so it is cheap for me


[25-Sep-23 08:40 AM] churavis#0000
Opportunity costs aside, you can do your own FE on Vulcan too


[25-Sep-23 08:55 AM] mrsmith33#0000

I would need to consult the oracle that is my production. But there is a chance that I might be able to influence that market. Not saying it‚Äôs a certainty, but if we wanted to plan it out my production with a little help could probably push that price lower.


[25-Sep-23 09:02 AM] fremen45#0000
That‚Äôs for AL.

Hi 
does anybody know this relation? 
Level    Required    Current Workforce    Capacity    Satisfaction
Pioneers    1,310    1089 (119)    1,200


[25-Sep-23 03:11 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
I built pioneer habits but the  workforce isnt raising. I made already one permit


[25-Sep-23 03:11 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
i just activated the permit


[25-Sep-23 03:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which planet is it?


[25-Sep-23 03:12 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
main base Deimos


[25-Sep-23 03:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
A few things: you need 1310 Pioneers, but only have enough habitats for 1200.


[25-Sep-23 03:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
You only have 1089, but more will show up next population report (in 1 day, 12 hours)


[25-Sep-23 03:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
the (119) is 119 pioneers from the "workforce pool"


[25-Sep-23 03:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
I notice that the pioneer count on Deimos is close to 0% unemployement.


[25-Sep-23 03:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
weirdly 1089+119 > 1200, so I'm not sure if the 1089 includes the 119 or not


[25-Sep-23 03:15 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
thanks Archiel


[25-Sep-23 03:15 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000

[25-Sep-23 03:15 PM] archielvahr#0000

[25-Sep-23 03:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Deimos has low unemployment, so it's possible the extra workforce pool ran out


[25-Sep-23 03:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Either way it'll probably fix itself in 1d 12h, which is when the next report happens


[25-Sep-23 03:16 PM] xfeuerdrachenx#0000
maybe it makes sense to start second base?


[25-Sep-23 03:16 PM] archielvahr#0000

[25-Sep-23 03:31 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I'm sure it's been discussed before, but I just realised that the base GL recipe produces THE SAME UNITS PER DAY as the FLX recipe?!
I feel like I'm going crazy. Why would I use the FLX recipe?


[25-Sep-23 03:35 PM] mrsmith33#0000
You are totally right, this doesn't make any sense


[25-Sep-23 03:39 PM] domicius#0000
Might be a typo?


[25-Sep-23 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
More GL for for SIO I guess.. but  if it's not faster....


[25-Sep-23 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
They did rework the SIO recipes during this universe


[25-Sep-23 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Before that, they didn't use NA


[25-Sep-23 04:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
but yeah, it's a weird one


[25-Sep-23 04:23 PM] mrsmith33#0000
it is cheaper it seems


[25-Sep-23 05:12 PM] higgsy#0000
Anyone interested in separating the Auctions channel into separate Buying and Selling channels?


[25-Sep-23 05:13 PM] exeler#0000
I'd like that. Maybe #auctions and #orders?


[25-Sep-23 05:13 PM] higgsy#0000
Sounds good


[25-Sep-23 05:27 PM] churavis#0000
We talked about this already and decided it would be better to have an auctions and archive auctions channel rather separate auctions and orders


[25-Sep-23 05:29 PM] churavis#0000
That way, everyone can mute the archive channel but still have it for reference if needed. The bot can clean up the auctions channel every day or so and then it will only have open or recently closed auctions and orders.


[25-Sep-23 09:34 PM] tuffyless#0000
So the ship STL travel time -vs SF usage is so glitchy.
My kids use that 'glitchy' term and I hate it but seems fitting to use here.

One click says 13h49m.
But another says 13h2m.

I know the ETA timing is accurate but is the STL use too?
Any idea about the damage calc differences?

EDIT: Just noticed the distance changes too, even though the source/destination is the same.

QUESTION:  Would this mean to keep clicking the same Fuel Usage until the minimum distance is appears and then go with that?

[25-Sep-23 09:52 PM] fremen45#0000
I‚Äôve seen this behavior. While I don‚Äôt have an answer. I would say check your fuel usage when you do this. Because I have noticed that sometimes the shorter time has a higher fuel usage even though I would have sworn that I did not move the slider.


[25-Sep-23 10:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
My understanding is that there's a known bug where clicking multiple times in the same spot on the fuel usages will cause it to recalculate the flight path. Usually it gets the same path, but sometimes it ends up going the wrong direction around the orbit of the Hohmann transfer and ends up with a path that takes more time (sometimes drastically more).  Cause all that stuff is modeled as part of SF flight and there are multiple valid transfers.


[25-Sep-23 10:46 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, this is exactly it. If you open the system view while you're planning the flight, you can see the planned transfers before sending the ship. You'll see the approach direction go with or against the orbit of the planet, vastly increasing or decreasing the travel time


[25-Sep-23 10:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
I wish it would just always pick the fastest time. Also, the arbitrariness of the FTL inlet/outlet points really bothers me. There's no guidance on if it's gravity wells or what exactly the ships are flying away from, but that can also impact the planned flight on the initial section as well (does it fly to an FTL exit point behind the planet or in front of it)


[25-Sep-23 10:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah, @exeler if the bot can do it, that'd be the best. I thought that's what we sort of decided on before?

I can help with that if you don't have time, maybe some weekend


[25-Sep-23 10:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
the fact that STL flight takes a different amount of time depending where things are in their orbit is "neat"... but actually awful because you don't really have the information to make use of those time windows... it just means STL travel is different each time for no gameplay reason


[25-Sep-23 10:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, STL flight to distant planets within a system can take quite a bit more time than FTLing out and back in


[25-Sep-23 10:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
which is obnoxious, and given that, it'd be nice if the route planning system tried to jump out then back in


[25-Sep-23 10:57 PM] archielvahr#0000

I'm having a consumables giveaway (courtesy of our beloved retirees) now that I have a new better empire plan. Oh, and apparently they are needed in fixed ratios, which would make managing them so much easier.


[17-Oct-23 10:30 AM] higgsy#0000
I forgot what I bought and what was donated so in the interest of simplifying my ANT warehouse, I'm just giving stuff away until the numbers remaining are pretty and balanced. Like, 200 EXO, 200 PT, 400 KOM. Odd numbers are bad juju.

star names are fun; I played some multiplayer game where you found a bunch of cities, and I named each of mine after a star. After 25 cities it was getting hard to find ones that didn't have stand-alone letters in the name

and report here if any look exciting for us


[25-Oct-23 09:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
rather, they made 60 more connections, so 120 more stars connected

Anyone making UTS and SUN, I need both for Nike when you get a chance. @exeler a way to counter a price in the orders seems like the best way. Like I don't care about the cost of these I just want them

How many jumps from ANT->OS-099 now? It's 39 steps now (19 jumps)


[30-Oct-23 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
eh I'm guessing it took like 5 jumps off at the most


[30-Oct-23 12:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
I actually didn't really see much good in the WR/MG sector, the branch to the south-east of ANT space


[30-Oct-23 12:39 PM] pateirn#0000
I am hoping this is just the first pass. This seems very useful, but unless we can setup mini hubs with good stuff far away, it seems kinda irrelevant still.


[30-Oct-23 12:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah OS-099 has some cheap planets but it's just so far away it's not worth it.

I looked really hard for a way to rationalize it

[30-Oct-23 12:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
yes, but only once they have a change that would radically break the current universe. Current top expectations for that are introduction of asteroids


[30-Oct-23 12:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
minimum another 1.5 year, since we know their plan through next summer


[30-Oct-23 12:57 PM] churavis#0000
In the last dev discussion they said that resets are a lot of work and that they wouldn't be doing one until they are forced to and only with a lot of prior warning


[30-Oct-23 01:00 PM] pateirn#0000
That makes perfect sense. Sounds pretty fun since I started so "late", but I am sure that would shed a pretty decent chunk of the player base too

I can certainly see both sides. Especially if they do some marketing with a reset too


[30-Oct-23 01:02 PM] churavis#0000
If the game is changing enough to require a reset, they would certainly get a bunch of inactive players back who only left because they ran out of new things to do

hopefully they link it with OS-476 at least


[30-Oct-23 03:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
and AU-709 to GM-037 would be another big cut, it would probably knock it down to ~2d travel time

[30-Oct-23 03:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I do believe it's the only system in game with 3 habitable planets though


[30-Oct-23 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
I should update my algorithm to find clusters of resources. at the time I was just looking at water for HYF planets


[30-Oct-23 03:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah it's a link between OS-099 and OS-476, so that cuts GM-498 down to only 4 jumps


[30-Oct-23 03:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
GM-498a is HSE+TSH though, oof


[30-Oct-23 03:39 PM] hernanduer#0000
also they connected GM-212 with GM-332

those are the two red circles I have down there

[01-Nov-23 03:12 AM] exeler#0000
I added a new feature to the bot. Now it has a `shipping-offer` command that helps handle coordinating shipping contracts. 

The command lets you say "I have X weight and Y volume going from A to B" and then helps keep track of how much space is left.

The bot will calculate the weight/volume of the items other people add to the shipment and it'll reject attempts to overfill the ship with a message that tells you exactly how many items would fit.

Optionally, you can set a price per t/m (whichever is higher,  it defaults to 10 AIC) and a time you intended to depart (set in minutes until departure like a countdown). The bot will calculate prices and display a cool countdown timer (if you set a duration)

For an example I put an offer in #shipping : https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/923700039497424967/1169185991525933136 (yes, it's a real offer)

As usual, let me know if you have any questions or feedback.

I've ben kicking around the idea, as a flashy way to show off to the community. FIO has a ton of integration options, none of it seems very heavily used, although I guess there are some corps that use the shared data functions.


[01-Nov-23 09:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
Even if it was just simple stuff like a live roster of the corp, it would be neat to see it on a web page. I'll leave the discord bot integration ideas to you


[01-Nov-23 09:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
but if I got more serious about my insurance offering, I could post it there


[01-Nov-23 09:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
or if we started selling completed ships again in some capacity


[01-Nov-23 09:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
There's an open question: what does the webpage do better than a shared google doc? I think the main thing is just showing off the corp in a fancy way


[01-Nov-23 09:55 PM] exeler#0000
Related to the ship idea, I had an idea of adding on to the bot's order fearture to help with managing building ships. So we could take orders internally and externally and have the benefits of a managed queue without turning that management into someone's second full time job


[01-Nov-23 09:56 PM] exeler#0000
A webpage where we could configure the offers, take orders, and view the queue could be handy

If individuals could list their stock, the bot/page could determine if a whole ship can be assembled. People need to do the extra work to keep updating their stock numbers though (if they add more items or sell some outside the bot)


[01-Nov-23 09:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
the tough part is wondering... does anyone have this engine? or a different engine that I'd be fine with? etc


[01-Nov-23 10:10 PM] exeler#0000
Considering I hear complaints about people trying to sell engines often, giving someone a tool to advertise their stock and get it sold easier seems like it might have some benefit

[10-Nov-23 09:18 AM] churavis#0000
The COGC, faction bonus and expert bonuses all compound. For example, I get 111% extra faction bonus with only 1 extra permit but have 177% efficiency on Phobos instead of the 160% you would get with just COGC and full experts combined.

[17-Nov-23 05:14 PM] exeler#0000
I've wanted to implement this for a while, but discord actually doesn't support dynamic UIs like this. 

There's two potential work arounds that I've thought of. 

1) Make the price per item optional, if not specified the price defaults to some value. Could be corp rate, or some average value calculated from somewhere (FIO CX data maybe? Could also read from past auctions/orders, or even let people configure the defaults themselves). Downside is that you'd have to know beforehand what items the bot doesn't have defaults for and then remember to set those explicitly. 

2) Remove the price option from the command arguments and use a modal (the pop up window that asks for data) instead. Same deal here, if the bot has enough info to put a sane default, you don't get the model prompt. This could also apply for options like location (read from channel name?) or currency (configurable by server/channel?). Downside here is that there's no way to override the default unless the modals are always displayed, but prefilled out for you.

Or some hybrid of the two, most command options could be made optional, then modals prompt for anything the bot doesn't have a default for. This way you could still override defaults, but skip the modals if you're happy with accepting defaults.

The fundamental problem is that the bot has no way to interact with the clients (us typing in commands) while the command parameters are being filled out. It can dynamically generate modals based on data put into the command (or a modal, the bot can chain modal responses, but I think getting multiple pop ups for a single command is annoying).


[17-Nov-23 05:50 PM] churavis#0000
It's not that hard for people to look up a list of prices on the shared sheet


[17-Nov-23 06:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think a lot of people search the price sheet, and if someone doesn't have a price listed, they just take someone else's price. That's what I ask people to do for me because I make more stuff than I can list now


[17-Nov-23 06:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
(and they're all at ANT)


[17-Nov-23 06:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
An official list would be nice in a lot of ways, but also I don't want people to push people too hard to sell at prices they haven't come up with themselves

1 or two EXT?
`2xHB1 8xHB2 2xSTO 2xEXT 10xGF` is looking good


[18-Nov-23 08:19 AM] churavis#0000
I've got 3 EXT, 3 SME and 8 GF because I wanted to export some SIO and SI as well.


[18-Nov-23 08:20 AM] churavis#0000
I'm sure you won't need 2 STO, The planet does have a warehouse and GF products are lightweight


[18-Nov-23 08:48 AM] mrsmith33#0000
2 HBB, 2 HB1, 5 HB2, 1 STO, 4 EXT, 8 GF, 2 SME is pretty space efficient (198 area)


[18-Nov-23 09:13 AM] churavis#0000
Is that going to produce too much SIO for you? It goes up and down in price all the time.

I wish there was a way to tell what I am selling. Every once in a while I try to sort through my CXOS but it‚Äôs really tough to tell where most of that comes from. I imagine it‚Äôs mostly contracts rather than the CX

Yes, but are they all on the flow chart, at least for Antares?

More importantly, what are their implications? do they make any new planets or regions viable that weren't before?

you can get from Norwick to Etherwind a lot faster, and ANT to Demeter (since KI-401 now connects to Demeter system)


[29-Nov-23 09:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
or Harmonia to 602c

[07-Dec-23 03:24 PM] cleavingambiguity#0000
I am working with a friend to create a vertical in ANT by partnering with his agriculture buildings. I'm currently leaning toward C or RAT production and would like to tap the knowledge here.

Is one or the other more needed by OOGA? Is there a different product I should consider for a vertical with a farmer that could better meet needs in ANT?

My default would be to build on Harmonia next to him. But I would like to know if there are agricultural refinement-focused planets that would be better suited.


[07-Dec-23 04:36 PM] churavis#0000
We have Norwick right next to Harmonia as an FP planet and Nascent is a resource extraction planet we use for burning C as well as mining ALO. Fertile planets are scarce so it's best to use them exclusively for farms.

[07-Dec-23 05:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep, either RAT or C are good starting points for you and your friend. Both are very liquid and will sell quickly on the CX or in the corp


[07-Dec-23 05:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you make your own C a next natural step after that would be either smelting or plastics


[07-Dec-23 05:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
And if you are doing food production, a common next step after RATs is FIM. Growing HER on the farms using DDT is a bit more complicated but has good profits

but yeah the volume change since late october has been pretty significant


[09-Dec-23 03:33 PM] dehzhas#0000
Ok, maybe that was me


[09-Dec-23 03:33 PM] dehzhas#0000
Not only me, but I probably contributed


[09-Dec-23 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
90k DW in the last week means 120k H2O, right? Total volume on the CX is something like 25-30k H2O a day


[09-Dec-23 03:51 PM] dehzhas#0000
I probably only average 2-4k a day, but I switched to mostly direct contracts when the 25/u ran out.


[09-Dec-23 03:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh? Am I misunderstanding the LEAD board numbers?


[09-Dec-23 03:56 PM] dehzhas#0000
I think I did math wrong


[09-Dec-23 03:56 PM] dehzhas#0000
I use water for DW and HYF


[09-Dec-23 04:17 PM] dehzhas#0000
I'm short about 32k on producing H2O for my DW. MAI production uses another 6.6k, VEG is 10.6k, so I buy roughly 50k/week or about 7k/day. Some I buy off CX, but a lot I was buying on CX.

If @archielvahr is right and CX is 25-30k/day, I consume probably 20-25% of the market on ANT


[09-Dec-23 04:17 PM] dehzhas#0000
So, yeah, might be me running the supply out


[09-Dec-23 05:37 PM] exeler#0000
I mean, we went from "MHL is hard to sell" to "Who has MHL? we all need MHL". Not surprising the H2O marker noticed a large volume uptick


[09-Dec-23 07:29 PM] higgsy#0000
I mean, the new HYF hub near ISA we're building could be a factor


[09-Dec-23 09:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it only has 4 bases right now so the whole planet is consuming like 4500 H2O/day

a lookup command for past prices from yourself or others before doing an auction would be helpful


[21-Dec-23 10:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
same for orders - really just a generic "what was this item last bought/requested for and when" would be nice

Would be cool if all O buyers that want to buy from me could broadcast their demand of O to me. Something like a sum of burn values of `O` on each planet where they want to buy. Then I can compare this number between Vulcan/Deimos/ANT and bring the next load there.


[26-Dec-23 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I use 100/day but it's across like 4 or 5 planets.


[27-Dec-23 11:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
I use 200/d, but same thing. Better to just take shipments on ANT for me


[27-Dec-23 11:46 AM] tuffyless#0000
I use 100/d and same as above; easier to make the trade on ANT.


[27-Dec-23 12:34 PM] mrsmith33#0000
yeah, bringing it to ANT is more convenient, as I can refuel and fly back immediately.


[27-Dec-23 12:34 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I will also sell some TIO occasionally


[27-Dec-23 12:36 PM] neth_havoc#0000
150/d, ANT is good enough for me


[27-Dec-23 02:01 PM] exeler#0000
I also overproduce O and bringing it all to ANT is easiest

Sorry for disappear awhile. 
I think I will remake my base because I diversifying into too many industries has often led to a problem of insufficient supply for me.


[07-Jan-24 09:58 PM] martin1194#0000
So I removed some of my supply list in excel. 
I will auction when I have spare stuff.


[07-Jan-24 10:03 PM] martin1194#0000
diversifying into too many industries let me can't offer best price in Ooga D:


[08-Jan-24 12:13 PM] exeler#0000
So I may have accidentally left TRU on recurring for waaay too long. 

Would anyone be interested in buying a lifetime supply of TRU?


[08-Jan-24 12:14 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I will take 1000


[08-Jan-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
lol they add up really fast.


[08-Jan-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Once I made 2k.. they did actually sell pretty quick on the CX


[08-Jan-24 12:16 PM] exeler#0000
Send me a contract on ANT. Make up whatever price you want.


[08-Jan-24 12:16 PM] mrsmith33#0000
100AIC?


[08-Jan-24 12:17 PM] exeler#0000
That works for me.


[08-Jan-24 12:17 PM] mrsmith33#0000
buying 2k then


[08-Jan-24 12:19 PM] exeler#0000
I've only got 1.4k

I forgot I cleared out a bunch of CX orders already üòÖ


[08-Jan-24 12:20 PM] mrsmith33#0000
ok, cancel the first contract


[08-Jan-24 12:22 PM] exeler#0000
I mean, I can always make more TRU if you really want lol.

I'm curious how you'd even go about spending 1k TRU


[08-Jan-24 12:24 PM] mrsmith33#0000
that's enough for a while


[08-Jan-24 12:37 PM] churavis#0000
1k sounds like a lot but a few high HQ upgrades will use those up quick


[08-Jan-24 01:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
@emperyan11 I offer much cheaper HE3 if you would rather just buy direct than off the CX


[08-Jan-24 01:39 PM] emperyan11#0000
That works for me too! What's your "usual" price and I'll set up some contracts in the future


[08-Jan-24 01:40 PM] hernanduer#0000
135/u is fine, I'm shipping a lot more to ANT since I setup some REFs on 206i, so just target them for ANT. I still have 5k available on ANT right now


[08-Jan-24 01:41 PM] emperyan11#0000
Perfect! I'm probably good for a few weeks here now but I'll be back for certain!


[09-Jan-24 04:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
weird, I got a Materials Sold line a few minutes ago in my FIN buffer, but I didn't get a materials sold notification


[09-Jan-24 04:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
I checked all my orders too and none of them are showing the 645k I got, or even any sells in the last hour


[09-Jan-24 04:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
like 645k is a lot, I should be able to see that


[09-Jan-24 04:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
wallet shows the increase though, so it's not just a spurious log


[09-Jan-24 04:07 PM] churavis#0000
Did you buy anything for that amount?


[09-Jan-24 04:08 PM] hernanduer#0000

[09-Jan-24 04:09 PM] churavis#0000
It wouldn't be the amount of the order but the amount of the part of the order that sold at that moment


[09-Jan-24 04:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah but I got no sales notification (which I do have turned on) and I checked all orders that could possibly have that value - nothing


[09-Jan-24 04:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
like I opened them up to see if a sale occurred


[09-Jan-24 04:11 PM] churavis#0000

[09-Jan-24 04:12 PM] hernanduer#0000

Formatted that way it should be a sale on a CX thing. I would suspect it was just a notification lost in the ether (i didn't know you could turn those on for partially complete cx orders actually)

[14-Jan-24 10:01 AM] donmega1983#0000
I was a customer at the bojidar. I notice that I can't cope on my own anymore. I need more shipping capacity now. I think it might be easier in a community.


[14-Jan-24 10:35 AM] allocater#0000
have you upgraded the starter ships yet? That is usually the first step, after that, building more ships


[14-Jan-24 10:36 AM] donmega1983#0000
I tried. Then the message comes up that there is no difference between blueprints.


[14-Jan-24 11:03 AM] allocater#0000
in the second blueprint you have to change the cargo bay to High-load Cargo Bay, that should give a difference of:

WCB + LFE + 25 SSC + 16 BHP

Astraeus is god of dusk, wind, stars, and planets. It fits with the theme. I suspect we'll end up calling it "Astra".

That looks like a new planet, so you should get your starting 200 people, then more will show up each week. Being governor and running immigration is really really helpful for new planets

On that note, at what condition should you start thinking about repairing ships? I‚Äôve been playing a bit over 100 days now and haven‚Äôt repaired any yet üòÖ


[21-Mar-24 08:10 AM] melon164#0000
They start slowing down when condition drops below 80%


[21-Mar-24 09:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
i left mine until they were either just over 80% or just below it


[21-Mar-24 11:39 AM] churavis#0000
Now that there are higher fixed costs for repairs, I've been repairing them around 81% or 82%

It's been a while, but I just pushed a new update to the bot we have in here!

Nothing major is new, but the OG `/auction` command got a bit of a face life. The bid and partial bid buttons should now behave the same as the `/order` command (you can now set a partial bid straight away without having to create a full bid first)

90% of the other changes I made were backend refactoring stuff to make things work more consistently, but shouldn't impact anything

Ironically though, I broke the partial bid buttons on any currently open auctions, the other buttons for full bids and finishing them should still work though üòÖ


[27-Mar-24 11:01 PM] exeler#0000
For fun facts, the bot has 738 auctions in its database. Considering it's only about a year old, and didn't even have a database at first, that's roughly 2 auctions per day on average.


[27-Mar-24 11:01 PM] churavis#0000
It's been super useful


[27-Mar-24 11:03 PM] exeler#0000
I've been considering sharing it more publicly in the community tools discord, seems unbalanced to let OOG be the only benefactors of it ü§£

I wanted to get some CI/CD on it and make the codebase a bit more pretty before doing that, but considering my off-hours programming escapades have been near 0 for the last 6 months, that's probably not happening anytime soon

ANT or Griff, depends on how much you want refined I suppose. Just add a couple days buffer to whatever the refining time / 8 and it should be good

Completely anecdotally, it seems like CL.AI1 has way more supply than demand, so maybe that‚Äôll encourage more chemistry. Which means more SC. Maybe.

Another fun tip from this report. We had a drop in CIS money supply. Looks like 3 big players disappeared probably. A net loss of 124m CIS, when there's typical growth of like 200m+... probably means 324m across those players who quit.

The interaction has a timeout set. So I think that means that like 10 minutes or so after the command is used the nav menu won't work any more.

1 little trip from ANT to Vulcan made the SSC count for repairs go up 1.  of course, the game won't let me mostly repair my ship.  It's all or none

Forget to haul something else after already sending a ship to deliver a forgotten item and now it'll have to do a slow hour(s) long turn to get back to pick up that other item? (No, that definitely hasn't happened to me repeatedly )

For repairs, always buy a little more than you need. You'll use the extra for the next repair anyways

I don't have deep pockets yet to keep stockpiles of stuff


[09-Apr-24 07:09 PM] exeler#0000
You only need an extra 1 or 2 or things. 

If you're so strapped that an extra LHP or SSC is gonna cause a problem, it's probably not worth repairing the ship at all.


[10-Apr-24 02:22 PM] allocater#0000

A new update for the auction bot!

It should now go through and clean up old auctions (if you had an old auction, you probably already noticed. The bot will send out DMs to people when it closes an auction for you)

The default setting is 7 days. No option added to the command to set a max time yet, but that's coming next.

Sorry to anyone who got spammed from lots of forgotten auctions üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I feel like I have saturated the corp's demand for hydrogen so I'm going to move to a request system for hydrogen instead of an auction system. When you need hydrogen, simply send me a contract at 60 AIC/u on ANT for however much you need

I also produce a lot of hydrogen which I sell on ANT regularly.  If there are orders on the exchange at 70 AIC/u I fill them, so if Churaviis happens to be out, just put up an order on the exchange.  I ship from IIg every couple of days.

Is anyone interested in opening an EDC base for the bank? It's 525k AIC per week (175 EDC @ 3000/u), with no costs to you - you just have to accept a bunch of contracts from me every 60-90 days. There's still plenty of unemployed engineers on Mahalat.


[13-Apr-24 10:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
about to get HQ level 25, opening a base on 110a. After reconfiguring my 3 FP planets, I'll be able to provide ~25 GIN/d, ~100 ALE/d, and ~50 FIM/d in excess in corps auctions, so look forward to that increase coming soon to a station near you! Also +1 WIN/d and new 5 MEA/d, but given such low quantities auctions will be very infrequent

[15-Apr-24 12:46 PM] churavis#0000
When you have a large pile of something on ANT then do an auction and everyone interested will get an equal portion


[15-Apr-24 12:52 PM] katinga#0000
I am not familiar with that bot here.  The bot traffic on the auction channel is a little confusing.  The auctions aren't bid on?


[15-Apr-24 12:53 PM] churavis#0000
It's a reverse auction where anyone can put a bid in and then get an equal portion of the total material on auction. Simply go to the Auction channel and then type a "/" and then auction then fill in the fields


[15-Apr-24 12:54 PM] churavis#0000
Wait a day or two and then finish it and send out the contracts


[15-Apr-24 12:57 PM] turlorn_angren#0000

The devs have said that they won't be starting a new universe for a while since it's a lot of work and they've stabilized the servers so the data is less likely to become too corrupted.


[19-Apr-24 06:45 PM] churavis#0000
They've also said that planet names will carry over, although there's no guarantee that a name will end up on a similar or even relevant planet (e.g. Apothecary)


[19-Apr-24 06:49 PM] draconisdomini#0000
So Asbestos Lead Asbestos could end up as an agricultural planet

I feel like there's an argument that prosperous universe is a post-apocalyptic dystopia. no one gets paid but us CEOs, everyone eats bars of vegetables and grains. if you work hard, you get flavor. and there's like 200 million people max in the universe

It's only a dystopia for some people.....


[19-Apr-24 07:30 PM] exeler#0000
Not to mention the 24 hour shifts with no days off


[19-Apr-24 07:31 PM] churavis#0000
I don't remember anything about 24 hour shifts. I assumed they were rotating shifts to allow the equipment to be used 24/7 even if the workers rotate


[19-Apr-24 07:32 PM] exeler#0000
True, could be that. 

And missing 10% pop slowing things for a short order down by 10% is just 10% of the equipment not able to be staffed?


[19-Apr-24 07:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, missing 10% of the hours you need to staff it day-round


[19-Apr-24 07:33 PM] sidepipe#0000

Oh, and the only thing the government does is supply office supplies and posters about how you should work harder (on most planets)

[22-Apr-24 04:56 PM] sidepipe#0000

[22-Apr-24 04:57 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000

[22-Apr-24 04:58 PM] sidepipe#0000

[24-Apr-24 11:08 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Maybe we should have an ability to specify who will create a contract, when fulfilling an order?


[24-Apr-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, it wouldn't be bad if they weren't so tedious


[24-Apr-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000

also we still need an "AT ANY PRICE" order setting

[24-Apr-24 01:46 PM] exeler#0000
I think defaulting to the person selling the thing sends the contract works out okay. 

Or, in other words - Whoever clicks a button that results in a valid trade sends the contract. 

For auctions that's whoever clicks finish since the amounts aren't known until a its over. For orders, that's whoever is fulfilling the order since the amount is known as soon as someone signs up to provide. 

Otherwise if we flip it then the people who bid on an auction need to come back to a discord message regularly to see if the auction is done or not. 

Same with orders. The person who placed the order would need to come back regularly to the discord message and see if it was clicked on or not. In both of these cases there's no guarantee so the constant "polling" of the message is often wasted time. 

There absolutely is a case for BASIC licenses who can't send contracts but want to fulfill an order or run an auction though. I'd want to add a feature for this use case that doesn't create overhead for the more typical use case.


[24-Apr-24 02:43 PM] zipatsu#0000
Would it be possible to add a NOTE optional option to the command like the currency option?  It could be used to, if desired, add a short bit of text at the end to inform people that they'll have to be the one to send the contract / give a rough estimate of delivery or production time etc ?

Alternatively, when ship is taking off of planet and you cancel, the ship with only finish the takeoff (which is usually ~5mins)

i'd like it if you could set a manual delay time of like, say, 5 minutes, before a ship would begin to take off

yes of course you'd wait longer before your ship leaves, but at the same time, having that grace period to cancel the flight with no delay whatsoever would be amazing

Oh, was there another one?

There should've just been one bad contract I sent out for an auction (accidentally put the entire auction worth instead of the divided amounts). 

If there's another contract that got terminated or cancelled that you cared about let me know and I'll resend it.

I suppose there's the possibility that he did it just to hopefully make me buy all of it back in order to sell that ~60k H2O  at 31 instead of my listed 30.90 buy price,  not really sure what other reason there'd be for relisting it for 0 profit


[01-May-24 05:07 PM] exeler#0000
I mean, won't doing this make the volume for the day look pretty wild?

It'd be funny to start a bunch of these ping pong matches all over the CXs

My heart goes to the poor warehouse employees that are tasked with hauling all that water back and forth between the same area just to satisfy that game üòÑ


[01-May-24 05:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
speaking of warehouse, if you don't mind me asking - is your ANT warehouse just a solid block of H2O? I always wondered if you had it all listed or more in storage

Don't mind at all, I mostly just relist the buys and sells every week or so or when it gets below 100k on sale

[01-May-24 05:18 PM] zipatsu#0000
If it hits around 200k on sale I'll probably start holding some in storage just in case someone buys it all up again but so far that hasn't really been an issue apart from one player who bought everything I had listed a while back only to sell it back to me at a 0.10 / each loss shortly after üòÑ


[01-May-24 05:18 PM] zipatsu#0000
That could've been a thing had I not decided to branch out to Moria as well as people kept buying my stock on ANT to sell there :p

I've mostly covered all the nearby-ish planets so I'm currently working on gathering all the materials needed to build a CoGC, Warehouse, Popi and SST on GM-498a

[01-May-24 05:25 PM] zipatsu#0000
No problem ‚úåÔ∏è H2O does see a fair amount of sales so it's nice being able to supply it at what I hope is a reasonable price, someone suggested at some point that it was a plot to make COF cheaper somehow but really my only goal is to provide affordable H2O for (mostly) newer players to do whatever they want with without having to sacrifice space for rigs


[01-May-24 05:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's a plot by big H2O to sell more hydration

[02-May-24 05:18 PM] darjaves#0000
for example rn on Harmonia it's -3.14 or something


[02-May-24 05:19 PM] tuffyless#0000
The Fertility applies to FRM & ORC's.
On Harmonia, it is 97% rounded up.  So 100%-3.14%

harmonia is that sorry


[02-May-24 05:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, for any resource just look at the raw number. Etherwind is 42 flat


[02-May-24 05:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
ISA is like 53 or something, and Harmonia is idk 17? I haven't checked in a while


[02-May-24 05:21 PM] darjaves#0000
and harmonia is like 25.7


[02-May-24 05:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah yeah, not great, but it does something


[02-May-24 05:22 PM] darjaves#0000
So that does matter a lot in production?


[02-May-24 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
Fertility? No, fertility only matters in ORC or FRM outputs - not HYF


[02-May-24 05:22 PM] darjaves#0000
Ye, i mean the Raw number you talked about


[02-May-24 05:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh yeah, that's the only thing that matters


[02-May-24 05:23 PM] hernanduer#0000

okey, so one more question for now, hh, i produce BBH atm, but idk if that is the smartest thing to do, i'm looking in the market and see other nice things but idk, it's working fine now i'm earning lots of money. (enough)

[02-May-24 05:50 PM] churavis#0000
If you want to keep upgrading your HQ, you'll eventually need to make your own Afabs as well as Rfabs


[02-May-24 05:51 PM] darjaves#0000
Well HQ is for more bases right?


[02-May-24 05:51 PM] darjaves#0000
Or like sort of benefits


[02-May-24 05:51 PM] darjaves#0000
I can make 7 I think rn and it's based on Nike


[02-May-24 05:51 PM] churavis#0000
Either one


[02-May-24 05:51 PM] tuffyless#0000
right, more bases.  Each HQ upgrade gives you another Permit


[02-May-24 05:52 PM] darjaves#0000
So its only ness if you need more bases? Further no benefits?


[02-May-24 05:52 PM] churavis#0000
For Antares, free base permits also increase the efficiency of your electronics industry


[02-May-24 05:54 PM] tuffyless#0000
For neutral, you get Chem, Fuel, ResExt.
Guess it's a benefit but eh.  Kinda/Sorta.  
Seems kinda small to me considering the costs to upgrade.

Yes.  Like Churaviis said, if its based on a planet in ANT, then thats 10% Electronics.
If neutral, then its Chem/Fuel/ResExt.

Sneak preview of a new feature coming to the bot, didn't have enough time tonight to do everything in one sitting, but it's getting pretty close (just need to add some buttons to actually interact with it)

I also plan on having commands to create and load template projects as well. So we could store all of our standard ship configurations as templates and it'd be a super simple command to throw down a bulk order for all the parts for one. Could work for bases, hq upgrades, warehouse upgrades, etc as well.

An interesting thing I'm going to try out for this is that prices and currencies are optional when setting up the project. So you could just put down a list of materials, then let the people with the goods propose prices that the project owner can then review and accept/reject. If you do set a price up front like in the example I showed, then the negotiating process is cut short and it works essentially the same as /order does.

If this is useful enough, I might port that option/mode over to /order as well

@archielvahr for the ship stuff, did you figure out you can press up to redo the last auction command and just change a couple args?

Like for making new /auctions?

Made some more progress on this today. I found out discord has dropdown lists and have made good use of them for this. 

Would you all prefer the message to include the list of materials as well as the dropdown list? I was thinking the message would he handy for looking at what's still needed without having to click on something.

The dropdown will only include materials still needed, but I was planning on leaving already fulfilled materials as part of the message.


[05-May-24 02:48 AM] exeler#0000
Let know if there's anything you all would like to see (or not see) for this. I'm kind of just implementing what I think would be useful, but if you all have ideas as well I'd love to hear them!

[05-May-24 03:21 AM] allocater#0000
maybe something where you can say who should send the contract?


[05-May-24 04:22 AM] exeler#0000
I wonder if it'd be worth just having the ability to set "I have a basic license" in the bot so that it can track things. 

That'd let me do things like notify the bidders of an auction to send contracts if the person hosting the auction only has the BASIC license. Same for orders and now these projects. 

This project workflow is a little more complex and the rules for "who sends the contract?" aren't as intuitive as order vs auction (it's basically the same rules, but a project is a bit like both an order and an auction at the same time). So I definitely want the bot to say something like "please send the contract" to make it clearer who should do it. 

I'm getting very comfortable with the discord API at this point, so doing fancy things like this is a lot less troublesome than it was when I started.

Finally got that `/project` feature done (well, mostly. There's still a couple things I want to polish up, but it is functional now)

To kick it off, I've used it to try and organize building a new standard 2k/2k ship in #ship-building 

Eventually I want to create a template system for this so it's easier to configure and place big orders like these, but for now we can share the bill of materials easily. The one for the order I placed is:
`1 BR1@700000AIC/u, 1 CQM@850000AIC/u, 1 FFC@350000AIC/u, 1 FSE@650000AIC/u, 1 LCB@325000AIC/u, 2 LFE@200000AIC/u, 94 LHP@2100AIC/u, 2 MFE@80000AIC/u, 1 MFL@80000AIC/u, 1 MSL@100000AIC/u, 1 QCR@700000AIC/u, 1 SFE@50000AIC/u, 128 SSC@300AIC/u1 BR1@700000AIC/u, 1 CQM@850000AIC/u, 1 FFC@350000AIC/u, 1 FSE@650000AIC/u, 1 LCB@325000AIC/u, 2 LFE@200000AIC/u, 94 LHP@2100AIC/u, 2 MFE@80000AIC/u, 1 MFL@80000AIC/u, 1 MSL@100000AIC/u, 1 QCR@700000AIC/u, 1 SFE@50000AIC/u, 128 SSC@300AIC/u`

For more details (like screenshots showing different steps, or the source code if you're a big nerd like me) check out the merge request on gitlab: https://gitlab.com/Jordan-Cottle/prosperous-bot/-/merge_requests/25

Hopefully the commands and the prompts/messages it gives are straightforward and intuitive, but if anyone has any questions, please let me know!

Ideally you should maximize CoGC gains, by only putting corresponding production, but in reality you have limited permits


[17-May-24 05:03 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
yeah true


[17-May-24 06:23 PM] exeler#0000
Also, the only cogc industries that actually benefit from the planet are resource extraction and agriculture. 

Most of the time the other planets are just taking advantage of the conveniently co-located resources, but everyone who builds the resource extract buildings is sacrificing space they could've used for a cogc boosted building instead.


[17-May-24 06:26 PM] zipatsu#0000
All those beautiful planets with plentiful water, only to be ruined by those.... farmers and their talk of ''the good fertile soil''  taking the CoCG hostage for non-resource extraction options üòí

[19-May-24 01:28 PM] zipatsu#0000
Am not outrageously rich either so really all it would take is one player like Allocator just buying up all my supply without selling it back to me to start raising the price again. Granted I do produce a metric ton of H2O myself but shipping that back and forth takes at least 2-3 so there'd definitely be an opportunity to break the price I've set currently (am just hoping both old and new players appreciate being able to get H2O at a stable price and thus don't do this üòÑ )

So far most people I've seen talk about it do seem to like the stability of it when it comes to planning things out, and as far as I'm aware (haven't done too much research) pretty much anything you do use the H2O for sells for a good amount of profit like DW is 187 per FP slot with the H2O recipe or 328 per FP slot with the H2O + PG recipe

I was half tempted to leave the game up in the background in order to delete the buy listing as soon as they bought out the 200k sell and then lowering my 200k buy down to 25 or something while listing more supply myself at 31/u but I figured the optics of that gap would reflect poorly on me from an outside perspective üòÖ

[30-May-24 11:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
The open jobs will push the happiness up. It will still be ramping up from prev values. doing the math in my head.. the max migration in you'll get is ~300, and it wont' have ramped up, so maybe like 200. Family support will boost is 20% to 240... sooo if you can run a program do the settler immigration to get it to 400 (+200 from the program)


[30-May-24 11:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
It still caps at 100% happiness even with a huge number of open jobs, so you won't ever get "migration in" above 30% of the start of the week's settler population

A reminder to myself for later tonight. I'm think I'm going to:
1) start advertising for recruitment, with expectations of a pretty high bar for people who come to us .
2) Update shipbuilding quantities, buy next batch of components.
3) Considering buying components at our internal price for sales inside OOG (any interest for that)? I would do that with existing contracts and a rebate maybe, as a way to minimize contracts / clicking. Which is already a lot üòõ 
4) Make a list of prunplanner recommended bases for OOG members who have permits available but no plans to use them. SE-110 combos (H2O + DW, H2O + HYFs + INCs, etc). Ant2D EPO base, growing technician population on Malahat. 
5) Work towards personally providing of certain HQ upgrade materials for free to OOG members.
6) Delegate someone to clean up the retirees out of the production sheet. 
7) Mark retirees in discord too.


[31-May-24 03:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
8) Oh yeah, maybe a shipyard in SE-110 if enough people are interested. Mostly just as a funsies project. I do move a ton of stuff around in-system

Reactors scale roughly equal


[31-May-24 08:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
so if you put them both to 0/minimal FF usage, the fuel usage will be the same, but because of the slightly larger size of the HYR+BR2 it'll be slightly slower


[31-May-24 09:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
they give you a wider range to choose from

I don't really think about the cost of fuel at this point anyways with maybe a resupply to each base every 10 days

I have buy orders up for a bunch of them


[31-May-24 11:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't mind paying CX prices, really. Especially if it's in corp


[31-May-24 11:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
I did buy from a bunch of your orders today, hehe üòÑ


[31-May-24 11:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I'd take all that, for sure. I could use like 50 OLF per day it looks like


[31-May-24 11:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Will also take your MHP/HOG/BID. BID probably won't be worth it given the price of KV. And HOG might be pretty price ineffecitve to. Ideally like 5k per HOG. But the pink ones I'll need for Comfort


[31-May-24 11:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh HOGs are good at like 8k in the 4-d arcades.


[31-May-24 11:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
SOI is pretty good at 445. PFE at 679. Still way better than FOD.


[31-May-24 11:54 PM] hernanduer#0000
I produce some excess BID/MHP


[31-May-24 11:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
BID would need to be like 27k/u


[31-May-24 11:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah BID sucks üòõ


[31-May-24 11:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
MHP I could do like 3.5k. I don't make a lot of excess though, just here and there


[31-May-24 11:55 PM] hernanduer#0000
lol ya it gave me an outlet for excess KV


[31-May-24 11:55 PM] archielvahr#0000
I wish they would rebalance the biggger buildings


[31-May-24 11:55 PM] hernanduer#0000

[31-May-24 11:56 PM] hernanduer#0000
I make so many SAR now


[31-May-24 11:56 PM] archielvahr#0000

That'll keep your CX buys up if wanted.
How much for the OLF? ; I'll contd that too.


[01-Jun-24 12:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
For OLF I think I could go up to like 780


[01-Jun-24 12:02 AM] archielvahr#0000

Lemme know if I screwed anything up in them; alittle tipsy tonight.

[01-Jun-24 03:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
Kinda interested in people's ideas here - I'm working on revamping some of my bases and can't decide what to do next:


[01-Jun-24 03:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have 3 permits on harmonia feeding RAT/FIM production on Norwick. I also have a HAL mine on Halcyon that I don't need anymore since big HAL is up and running. I'm trying to decide if it would make more sense to start up burning C on halcyon and feed that from Harmonia or HYF on Life, or if I should focus on moving farms from harmonia to life to free up two permits


[01-Jun-24 03:30 PM] churavis#0000
I'm starting to burn C on Halcyon with HCP from Life, it saves a permit over Harmonia but requires a ludicrous amount of MHL


[01-Jun-24 03:31 PM] sidepipe#0000
Are you able to feed a full INC base on Halcyon with HYF on Life?


[01-Jun-24 03:31 PM] mrsmith33#0000
There is also Demeter for FRM


[01-Jun-24 03:31 PM] churavis#0000
I could feed like 5 or 6 bases

{Reactions}
‚ÄºÔ∏è 

[01-Jun-24 03:32 PM] churavis#0000
At the slow recipe


[01-Jun-24 03:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe that's the move, then. I'd like to free up those 2 extra harmonia permits if I can. Demeter might be a good idea as well


[01-Jun-24 03:33 PM] churavis#0000
Demeter won't need MHL or any special MATs but it is far away.


[01-Jun-24 03:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
True. I could also do both. At the end of the day, I want to repurpose those 2 harmonia permits + 1 halcyon permit for _something_ else without changing my RAT output too much


[01-Jun-24 03:35 PM] churavis#0000
Personally, I have my Demeter base just for feeding my 25 INC on Nascent


[01-Jun-24 03:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll have to stare at prunplanner for a while, but this at least gives me some ideas to look at üôÇ


[01-Jun-24 03:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe I could even build another CHP base to use up all that HAL from @.urpalhal üòÑ


[01-Jun-24 03:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could


[01-Jun-24 04:57 PM] melon164#0000
Demeter FRM ‚Äî> KI-401d INC is the magic carbon formula for me


[01-Jun-24 04:57 PM] melon164#0000
It‚Äôs a shame the other planets in Demeter‚Äôs system are so awful


[01-Jun-24 05:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since Demeter is far, it's good for HER.


[01-Jun-24 05:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
I really enjoy the combos on SE-110. Get water from ISA, then there's a planet for FPs, INCs, and HYFs. Looks like 110d is the only one you are missing.


[01-Jun-24 05:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
As far as profits, more chemistry seems to be good. You don't have a base on ANT 2d, and this planet makes EPO with very few visits: http://kortham.net/temp/firefox_2024-06-01_17-44-52.png

KV, EPO, NR are going to be long term winners I think


[01-Jun-24 06:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
doing HER on demeter is a solid idea, that way I can dedicate harmonia to just RATs

So I used to send grants out personally for a long time. But then Australis started the ADI before he joined OOG. And they had a grant program, and I figured I didn't want to duplicate efforts or step on any toes. So I just pay my grants through there


[05-Jun-24 12:18 PM] akyantor#0000
I benefited from the same scheme to the tune of 750k. A very helpful kick start, providing you had a good plan to use the funds.

New version of the bot released with the updated /project command. The message is now a "nav view" which means the message is split into pages with buttons to switch between them. 

Items still needing to be fulfilled are on separate pages from ones that have already been fulfilled.

Contributions are now also listed next to the items they are for, so everyone can see what offers are pending, rejected, and accepted.

I've also updated the messages themselves to be more useful, including having the bot do the math to calculate total costs to make putting in contracts easier.

I've also updated it to send a message to the project manager when a contribution is automatically accepted.

Overall, I hope this version is a lot more pleasant to work with. As always, please let me know if there's any issues or anything else you all would like to see added to it


[05-Jun-24 10:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ooh I got a message from the bot


[05-Jun-24 10:55 PM] exeler#0000
The update is also backwards compatible. Any existing projects will snap to the new style once someone interacts with them by placing an offer. Yours was almost done, so I bought an FSE off the CX and fulfilled one on yours to trigger the update üòÖ


[05-Jun-24 10:56 PM] archielvahr#0000

[05-Jun-24 10:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
So are you going to buy a new ship every time you test the bot? üòÅ


[05-Jun-24 10:57 PM] exeler#0000
Lol, might as well if people are willing to sell the parts. I bought 2 ships last time and my liquid assets didn't disappear like I thought they would.


[05-Jun-24 10:58 PM] exeler#0000
Next time I might be buying bases though. I intentionally avoided calling this the `/ship` command for a reason üòÑ


[05-Jun-24 11:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah this is really nice now. Awesome job


[05-Jun-24 11:04 PM] exeler#0000
Thanks! I had to re-think it like 4 times while making it...

The `NavigationView` class that gives me all the buttons and handles page management was super nice until I realized it can't handle updating from anything other than buttons on that message, and that it can't be persisted. I had to resort to some truly "cursed" (quote from the dev of the library I'm using üòÖ) hacks which turned out to be surprisingly effective.

Can't wait to tear even more holes into this discord api and library for the next feature üòÖ

Morning folks,
A quick question about the auction system. Does it have a fixed time to allow folks to submit bids, or is it auctioneers choice how long to wait for bids? May be a convention that folks generally follow.


[06-Jun-24 02:48 AM] mrsmith33#0000
You have to click `Finish` to finish each auction


[06-Jun-24 02:49 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, so whomever posts can decide when to finish. Cool.


[06-Jun-24 02:49 AM] akyantor#0000
I may have some materials to post in a little bit, so wanted to make sure I understood how folks used the system.


[06-Jun-24 03:16 AM] exeler#0000
The bot does close out auctions after 7 days, but it's intended just as a cleanup measure for forgotten auctions rather than some limit to how long an auction should be open for.

Eventually I want to implement an option for an auction creator to set a different duration for the auction auto close to trigger. Not sure how useful it would be though since usually you want to send the contracts right after you finish the auction. So having it close at some arbitrary time where you might not be at the game is a bit questionable.


[06-Jun-24 03:35 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, probably fine as it is as it allows some flexibility.


[06-Jun-24 03:36 AM] akyantor#0000
I mostly wondered if there was some convention on the time period that folks follow, but makes sense for this to not be the case.

[07-Jun-24 08:49 PM] zipatsu#0000
Appreciate the offer but I've a feeling they'll just buy up everything until I'm out of stock completely, 's not super difficult to do if you're willing to spend ~10m total on raising the price of H2O there. I've listed 60/106k for now so that if they do end up buying it tonight I'll have some more to throw up tomorrow. I think it'll go back to me just filling most of the buys down to my price for a while again until they get bored of whatever it is they're trying to achieve by this üòÑ

[07-Jun-24 08:53 PM] zipatsu#0000
I only have 2 bases supplying the Moria CX but it wasn't a super fast moving market generally which allowed me to stock up some 300k so it might turn out to be a good thing that it's all being bought up for now, only ''bad'' part would be the nice flat price line being interrupted again and I guess potentially the price of water rising on Moria but that's all part of the fun üòÑ


[07-Jun-24 08:57 PM] zipatsu#0000
Did see some players discussing H2O in game chat a few days ago with one of them believing I've been artificially inflating the price of H2O, which came as a surprise to me as I've worked on bringing it down from its high point, could be that this person's buying me out as a result of that but who knows really ü§∑

[11-Jun-24 08:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
I make NS on 639d too, but use 80% of it. Still excess 35/d


[11-Jun-24 08:33 AM] katinga#0000
I have the LST for someone making NS.  so one of the ingredients is available

I produce some NS, but not enough to supply my needs.


[11-Jun-24 12:01 PM] neth_havoc#0000
Do we have someone who can supply TIO? I'm always in need of TI and do have some smelting capacity.


[11-Jun-24 12:18 PM] melon164#0000
I could produce TIO on KI-401b but don‚Äôt have the capacity to move it anywhere


[11-Jun-24 01:18 PM] katinga#0000
2 spots in the KI hexagon for it.  SE-648 might be a good spot, too


[11-Jun-24 01:20 PM] churavis#0000
Can I buy a load of 1,265 TIO from you on KI-401b?

Should my third ship be a LCB or WCB ship?


[19-Jun-24 11:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you got two WCBs, generally the third will be an LCB for a bit more variety / flexibility. They actually hold about the same amount of HAL (921 vs. 1000)... and I assume you do move non-HAL  materials too üòÑ


[19-Jun-24 11:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess if you just have C on Nascent, metal on Deimos -> Nike, and HAL from Halcyon... it's kinda a wash


[19-Jun-24 11:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
More ALO fits in a LCB than a WCB


[20-Jun-24 12:03 AM] hernanduer#0000
It took 8 ships before I built another WCB


[20-Jun-24 12:03 AM] hernanduer#0000
LCB are definitely the most versatile


[20-Jun-24 12:19 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I guess the next in the plan is SE-110d for C with 110b and Harmonia fueling those INC


[20-Jun-24 12:19 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So in that sense LCB would make a lot of sense

[22-Jun-24 10:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
So - let's say I have 2 HYR. Is it worth it to upgrade my previous LCB ships with them, or would it make more sense to build a new ship entirely? It looks like it'd need a new bridge, crew quarters, and everything to upgrade, which feels like 90% of a new ship

[22-Jun-24 10:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
And then follow-up question - if I'm going all the way and putting a HYR in an LCB, what else should I add to it? üòÑ


[22-Jun-24 11:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Large FF and SF tanks probably


[22-Jun-24 11:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
Seats are cheap. I think the STS doesn't add to repair costs


[22-Jun-24 11:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
You might double check if the seats make a difference with the FSE. I think they can occasionally.


[22-Jun-24 11:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
Cool, I‚Äôll take a look. I don‚Äôt really _need_ more ships right now, but I do want to use these reactors üòÑ


[22-Jun-24 05:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
LSL are pretty pointless extra weight, MSL pretty much covers everything. On the other hand, I'd really like an extra large ftl tank


[22-Jun-24 05:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
BGS won't matter for an LCB with FSE, it might work for a VCB though given the lighter weight


[22-Jun-24 05:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
Could wait for the shields update before upgrading the ship, it's likely to reduce both maintenance cost and increase time between maintenance significantly


[22-Jun-24 05:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's probably reasonable, especially since this is kinda a vanity project üòÑ


[22-Jun-24 08:18 PM] martin1194#0000
@archielvahr Do u still have any help for new player in Ooga? Or only in ADI?


[22-Jun-24 08:19 PM] martin1194#0000
I thinking if I help new players, I should help in Ooga or ADI.


[22-Jun-24 08:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep definitely in OOG. And I just fill extra grants in ADI.


[22-Jun-24 08:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
If any new people in OOG need help, just ask! Lots to go around!


[23-Jun-24 03:09 AM] akyantor#0000
I suspect I'd benefit from some help when I eventually need my 3rd ship... but need to figure out when they'll be necessary. Will be getting a WCB upgrade in a week or two, which will make logistics a lot more manageable for the short term.

[23-Jun-24 12:25 PM] akyantor#0000
I guess there will be a lot more need for folks to participate in administration post release... minumum number of elected positions will be 2 per planet (providing two people get votes).


[23-Jun-24 12:26 PM] mrsmith33#0000

I'm wondering how things will work once the update releases - will they just have elections on every planet in the galaxy that has an ADM?


[23-Jun-24 12:30 PM] akyantor#0000
If 5 people can get enough votes across all the planets.


[23-Jun-24 12:30 PM] akyantor#0000
Yes, I'd imagine the election cycle will be the same, but with more than one person elected (if more than one gets votes).

And kinda related, maybe this was mentioned somewhere before and I missed it, but is it clear how exactly the voting will work? i.e. do we get 5 votes for 5 seats?


[23-Jun-24 12:35 PM] akyantor#0000
My interpretation is one person, one vote still.


[23-Jun-24 12:36 PM] akyantor#0000
That's why if you wanted more than one OOG member to be elected to a big planet it may require some co-ordination. If we all voted for a current member governer, then you'd potentially have 4 other seats filled with other folks.


[23-Jun-24 12:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, that's what I suspect as well. There'll be some strategy there depending on how many people run on a given planet


[23-Jun-24 12:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd assume we'd want to shoot for a majority of OOG members so there's not _too_ much democracy on any planet we govern üòÑ

Either way it'll make planetary management a lot more interesting / dynamic üòõ


[23-Jun-24 12:43 PM] katinga#0000
yeah, but it's hard enough getting 1 or 2 people to run on planets, let alone 5


[23-Jun-24 12:44 PM] katinga#0000
I don't the player pool is that large, is it?  Unless one player can hold office on more than 1 planet


[23-Jun-24 12:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can hold as many offices as you want


[23-Jun-24 12:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
and the parliamnet will shrink if less players run, acoording to the comments in that post


[23-Jun-24 12:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
So if you're on a planet large enough for a 5-member parliament, but only 4 people run, you'll end up with a parliament of 3 after the election if I'm understanding this correctly


[23-Jun-24 12:46 PM] katinga#0000
interesting


[23-Jun-24 01:09 PM] akyantor#0000
Tbh, it‚Äôll be interesting to see what happens on larger planets. Just how common it is that 5 people run & get votes?


[23-Jun-24 01:14 PM] akyantor#0000
I suspect it'll be somewhat rare for there to be that many.


[23-Jun-24 02:15 PM] katinga#0000
does anyone have some OFF that I can buy at ANT?


[23-Jun-24 02:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's absolutely unheard of to have 5 people running at once for the current governor system. 90% of the time it's uncontested.. 8% of the time some random newbie clicks run and doesn't say anything. 2% of the time it's an actual 1v1 actual competition. But I assume that will change once we get the update.


[23-Jun-24 02:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
since it mostly comes down to packing the parliment, and those members don't really ned to do anything, so they can pile in


[23-Jun-24 02:42 PM] akyantor#0000
Not yet, but I plan to be making a modest regular suppy from next week or so.


[23-Jun-24 02:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
MrSmith did a nice writeup of those added costs here: https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/870777970367811604/1223285097424228474


[23-Jun-24 02:45 PM] akyantor#0000
I think at the moment it would seem improbable to most folks that they'd upset an incumbant. I suspect we'll see at least a few more volunteers when there's more than one member of each parliment... that said, I'd still be quite surprised if you saw many planets with 4-5 people successfully elected.


[23-Jun-24 02:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
@exeler  is my usual OFF supplier. I'll ping him in case he has a bit laying around


[23-Jun-24 02:46 PM] katinga#0000
I wound up buying off the CX


[23-Jun-24 03:08 PM] exeler#0000
Yeah, I make a ton of OFF. 

If you buy regularly I usually run auctions once I have a good bit stockpiled. If you have a specific amount you need, you can let me know or run a /order. 

I usually make OFF as one of many things in my BMP, but if a large order comes in I have the inputs stockpiled so I can crank out a ton really quickly.


[23-Jun-24 03:10 PM] katinga#0000
I had a buy order since yesterday.  I had a ship at ANT when I asked a little bit ago.  lol


[23-Jun-24 03:20 PM] exeler#0000
Fair enough. I didn't check the game yesterday so I would've missed it üòÑ

it got lost in the scroll too.  i almost couldn't find it


[23-Jun-24 04:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe mildly interesting to some. I was playing around with trying to price options (european calls and puts) on different commodities using the Black Scholes model. Returns on FIM.AI1 are almost log-normally distributed, with just slightly fatter tails than the normal distribution:

[23-Jun-24 04:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don't think it'd be feasible to write options in Prun because the liquidity just kinda isn't there, but it was a fun exercise üòÑ


[23-Jun-24 04:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
Here's what they would cost if you did 7-day options on FIM anyway (Ks are the strike price, S0 is the current price for FIM). I can't guarantee any of this is correct though

[23-Jun-24 04:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
What might be more interesting is that you could use something like this to come up with confidence intervals for what prices might be in a given number of days. But again, it probably underestimates tail risk (so how likely a big price swing up or down might be)

[24-Jun-24 02:01 PM] churavis#0000
I assume that Governors will be able to give themselves the contracts to provide upkeep


[24-Jun-24 02:01 PM] mrsmith33#0000
CoGC will be supplied as before


[24-Jun-24 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the contracts don't fill the POPI, basically governors will fill the POPI as before and write themselves payouts

[24-Jun-24 02:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think as an organization OOG could set a price list for upkeep items so we have something official to point at when we are doing our government payouts.

It was in AA


[25-Jun-24 02:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But


[25-Jun-24 02:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
‚Äòhere‚Äôs what I think will happen:
- planets under 25 bases - will be easier for people like rise and myself to look after because they won‚Äôt require puppets. The management will be more tedious because even as a solo gov you need to use the whole motions nonsense to do everything, but perhaps tolerable
- planets with 26-99 bases - these get 3 seats and are the worst part. Aceland just sits over this threshold, as do probably most other ‚Äúmid‚Äù size planets with a few tens of thousands of pop. Managing these is currently trivial, but after the update everything needs to go via a committee and get 3 votes. Recently I updated the SST and INF on aceland because the happiness and Archiels sheet said it was probably a good idea. I did this by just‚Ä¶ bringing the mats and doing it, took me like 12 hours after deciding to do it to have it done. Fuck having to do this through a fucking committee, I‚Äôd rather quit the game.
- planets with > 100 bases - 5 seats. Maybe this will fix the classic OOG problem of neglecting big planets because they‚Äôre harder, but probably not since what we‚Äôll get in practice is 5 OOG seats. I think the classically well-managed starters will see existing governors who are otherwise performing well leave‚Äô


[25-Jun-24 02:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
‚Äòbut I accept my take might be too cynical. I find this whole update very frustrating. There‚Äôs so many other things wrong with the game that could‚Äôve been fixed, fuck we still have that stupid ‚Äúcan‚Äôt update just the qty or commodity‚Äù in a contd that was introduced in the i18n patch and it‚Äôs been a good 6 months, and yet here we are with the next patch completely wasted imo‚Äô

well when the game calls it rations.  it makes me think of ration bars you see in sci fi movies and books.  so plant based pemmican isn't a stretch.  it's not like we want our PIOs to enjoy life or anything

chemically, cotton and PG are similar.  the main diff is the MG that goes into the PG.  PE is just CH2 molecules

Is it possible he‚Äôs over exposed on governance materials, either production or stock, and if he loses control of all the planet then he‚Äôll have some kind of loss? Or so wealthy that it doesn‚Äôt matter? *I recall his most recent post emphasising that he wanted to maintain stability for at least one election cycle on each planet, so could infer a need to run down stocks.*


[27-Jun-24 05:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
Nah, he won‚Äôt contribute to most of the planets he‚Äôs elected as an MP on, just wax poetic about how much work he does overseeing everything while other people do the work. I‚Äôd imagine he‚Äôs going to keep actively maintaining the 12-17 planets he was on before

[27-Jun-24 08:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
I guess I should be a bit more precise about what I meant here. His stated goal is that he just wants to do oversight and offer advice on a lot of these planets - take Halcyon for example. He gave Hal some useful pointers about what inputs are cheapest, and he generally knows what he‚Äôs talking about. As long as he‚Äôs offering advice in that manner (and not like he did on Nike, for example) I‚Äôm all for it. He‚Äôll definitely keep governing the planets he was on before, and probably pick up a few he couldn‚Äôt find some for (like that Chem planet he offered me, KI something something)


[27-Jun-24 08:32 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm all for helpful advice. I guess from an image perspective what I‚Äôm worried about is that he portrays himself as taking an active role in the government of those ‚Äòadvice‚Äô planets even as folks like Hal (in the above example) are doing all the actual hard work

It can get a lot worse than that. Idk if you had a base on Nike or not at the time

Still, if a topic you want to discuss is important and you don't want it to get drowned out by other topics, the General channel is not your best choice


[27-Jun-24 09:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
The reason I am very vocal with Malahat is that it has had a engineer deficit for quite a while now, and it's in a fairly unique place and I'm taking a sort of unconventional approach to fix the situation.


[27-Jun-24 09:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
Also being super clear about the engineer shortage being something we caused with our EDC program helps give it some context- pointing out the sheer amount of growth


[27-Jun-24 09:16 AM] archielvahr#0000
The Nike issue is surreal and a lot of people are parroting it. I've considered explaining it and showing larger and longer deficits on Rise's planets, but I don't really want to engage on that. I don't think you can win that with logic, even if I spend an hour making comparison POPI charts


[27-Jun-24 09:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Rise does run out of steam if you just don't reply, because, as he says, he's in it for the trolling

You're not wrong, but we really should do a better job of checking on each other. The mistakes of a single member will reflect on the whole corp.


[27-Jun-24 09:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
I do agree with that. It would be nice to have, for example, COGC checkers. I don't know if we could do that with a sheet or what.


[27-Jun-24 09:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
I also personally think running _any_ project every week is a good way to demonstrate you're an intentional governor. It's awkward because sometimes one isn't really needed, and some people have a weird thing against festivals... but people can point to "no project" as a mistake


[27-Jun-24 09:20 AM] churavis#0000
Could you set up a sheet to automatically check each day if there is a COGC that needs to be fed within a day or something?


[27-Jun-24 09:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
mayyyybe? Maybe someone else can take a crack at that? I'm still trying to get my planet tracker to be in better shape. It takes 400 FIO queries to populate it because you have to mix together /planet, /planet/sitecount, /user, and /infrastructure to make the sheet


[27-Jun-24 09:23 AM] churavis#0000
Does FIO provide data on COGC or population infrastructure upkeep donations?


[27-Jun-24 09:23 AM] archielvahr#0000
And FIO has sooo much bad user data


[27-Jun-24 09:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
It shows COGC votes... start and end time (so we probably can figure the due date). I don't see contributions.


[27-Jun-24 09:25 AM] akyantor#0000
I tried poking around in the APIs, and couldn't find endpoints for a lot of the useful data points.


[27-Jun-24 09:25 AM] akyantor#0000
Also don't know how reliable it would be...


[27-Jun-24 09:25 AM] churavis#0000
Due date you could put in manually and then just add 10 days


[27-Jun-24 09:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
https://rest.fnar.net/infrastructure/Nike  has each building but the upkeep/contribvutions fields are always empty


[27-Jun-24 09:27 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think Yuen had a screen in Apex that was just all the planet COGCs


[27-Jun-24 09:27 AM] churavis#0000
Doesn't FIO depend on someone with the extension looking at a page with the relevant data? Probably it's empty because no one is regularly looking at it.


[27-Jun-24 09:27 AM] akyantor#0000
I've a screen like that. üòõ

To add to this, I did entire write-ups when I took over Deimos from Bob (they can still be found on the UFO channel). That's because it was a hot election, and a number of people were upset when Bob was ousted, even though he wasn't managing properly. Those write-ups helped overcome the initial resistance, to where I don't need to post them anymore.
With the new changes, I plan to post a summary in chat every time I feed the upkeeps, breaking down the costs vs the planet income. Since I know it's at a deficit every week, people won't want to change governors in case the new governor doesn't run the planet like a charity.


[27-Jun-24 05:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
I plan on setting up a sheet regardless, to track the value of payments


[27-Jun-24 05:35 PM] hernanduer#0000

[27-Jun-24 05:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
I don't want to run Nike like a charity, but since it's not a starter planet that should actually be pretty easy

üéâ Hello @everyone, especially our inactive and retired members! üéâ 

As you may know, the politics update recently released and we've had a ton going on in OOG. There's been a lot of close elections in ANT as we fill seats in the new parliaments. The introduction of governments as entities has also changed the way OOG operates, as we no longer receive dividends as a corp.

If you're interested in re-activating at this time, please check out a few key upcoming elections and üó≥Ô∏è  Vote üó≥Ô∏è  for OOG members on these planets:

* Nike
* Griffonstone
* WU-070a
* Demeter

We've received our final corp dividends, and if you're sitting on a bunch of money you're not intending to use, please consider donating it to one of our corp projects:

* **QJ-382 Fuel project**: Katinga is developing a few planets in this system for fuel production. Send any donations directly to Katinga (co IHM) to help out.
* **Project 6115**: OOG's secret project to colonize the only triple-green system in the game, on the outer reaches of ANT space, and to meaningfully use it as a triple Electronics system. Send donations to Archiel. By using the new Base Establishment Fee, we can choose to make this prestige system OOG only, or bring others in as the population grows.
* **New player donations**: Allocater manages the OOG bank which has given out starter funds and cheap loans to our new players.

Awesome, I'll tell @katinga  to request some money for the #‚õΩromulan-system project, and I'll send a request for #project-6115 . Honestly it looks like 7m (at corp prices) covers all the initial costs of the project- 3x ADM, LM, WAR, and COGC. The bfabs will probably be bought at MM prices. Thanks üòÑ

i need other bfabs, too.  I'll buy what I can get for now.  I can buy more from you later if I still need it

I have a question. How exactly do auctions work?


[03-Jul-24 12:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can start an auction with the /auction command. The person making the auction specifies the thing they are selling, the location, and the quantity they have.


[03-Jul-24 12:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can then bid, by default for the maximum amount- although if you want less, you can bid for a smaller quantity. When the auction starter clicks "finish", the system evenly spreads out the available quantity to all the bidders, up to their requested maximum.


[03-Jul-24 12:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
The prices are fixed, so as a bidder you don't increase the price - it's not like ebay


[03-Jul-24 12:44 PM] lancercaster#0000
Oh! I see. So it's split between those who are bidding.


[03-Jul-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep


[03-Jul-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Orders are the same, but you use them when you want to buy something.


[03-Jul-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
If there's a question about prices, then you just message them or bring it up in the channel.


[03-Jul-24 12:45 PM] archielvahr#0000
The /project command is for when you are buying a ton of things, like ship components or a whole base. That has a system in place for price negotiations.


[03-Jul-24 12:48 PM] lancercaster#0000
So are auctions for bulk selling? I have a few A-Fabs I get from the coop I'm in every week. Would anyone be interested in those, or should I build them up?


[03-Jul-24 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Afabs are pretty high value so people would be happy to buy just a few


[03-Jul-24 12:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
There's no real guidelines about it, but I'd probably roll my eyes if I saw 100 DW on there ü§£

It's more of a bulk sale thing where you can decide what the maximum amount is that you would want to buy at the given price, can also use it to just sell a single item too though. Then when the person who started the auction decides to finish it they'll send out contracts to the buyers (assuming the seller has Pro active), 's a nice system ‚úåÔ∏è


[05-Jul-24 06:35 PM] exeler#0000
Yup, that's exactly it. Auction is a bit misleading since it has basically nothing to do with how real auctions go.

Have you considered using something like caddy for handling SSL for this (or any other hosted projects)? It'll get rid off all those pesky warnings the browsers hit people with when going to http sites.

I've been using it for all my stuff and it's super simple to set up if you don't care about flexing how much you know about nginx configs.

I have had success with Lets Encrypt certs, I just didn't set it up yet since I figured there would be a proper domain name soon


[08-Jul-24 12:12 AM] archielvahr#0000
It is on a shared host, not one of my machines

If I were to make some Afabs to sell at CX, would the market be able to absorb it or would I need to sell through private deals?


[09-Jul-24 08:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don‚Äôt actually make Afabs, so others might be a better source on this, but they should sell. They might sit on the market for quite a while, but they‚Äôll sell eventually


[09-Jul-24 08:12 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Hum I might hold off a bit then. My liquidities are too low to be able to wait for sales


[09-Jul-24 08:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm sure you could sell them here faster if you needed quick money üôÇ


[09-Jul-24 08:13 AM] sidepipe#0000

Since you‚Äôre in the Corp now, you can roll my loan forward as often as you need - I‚Äôll just send you a new one to replace the old one üòÑ


[09-Jul-24 08:17 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Should be ok, what iv built so far is within what I can pay. 
But Afab inputs are beyond my cash for now


[09-Jul-24 08:18 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im gonna be sitting at about 30 mil in loans in a few days so i kinda need to chill a bit


[09-Jul-24 08:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs some serious leverage üòÑ


[09-Jul-24 08:20 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
When you HQ upgrades are so cheap, and the ROI is so quick it makes sense to borrow


[09-Jul-24 08:20 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But I‚Äôll be at 11 bases and 4 ships by the end of next week so cheap expansion is kinda done


[09-Jul-24 08:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, makes sense. I would‚Äôve taken loans early on but back then I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was gonna play for 60 days


[09-Jul-24 08:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
And here I am, 200 days later üòÑ


[09-Jul-24 08:21 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Also helps that here is so much liquidity free in the game


[09-Jul-24 08:22 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
When I last played about a year ago it wasn‚Äôt the same


[09-Jul-24 08:45 AM] archielvahr#0000
I find afabs sell fairly quickly on the CX. Sometimes they'll float around for a few weeks, then someone decides to pay for an HQ upgrade and they buy out a big chunk of the CX. Internally I think there's always a demand for them, because there's always a latent desire to work on the next HQ level... and most players have the capital, it's just a question of timing and asking


[09-Jul-24 09:12 AM] hernanduer#0000
I have 3 PP4s making Afabs non stop (except for the random TSH) and it still takes me months to get the next level


[09-Jul-24 09:12 AM] hernanduer#0000
there's always demand for Afabs üôÇ


[09-Jul-24 09:42 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

I was thinking of making more C by building a HYP base on Life

Ahh yep a HYF base can make a ton of carbon. Looks like you've got some water bases already too. I use Thalassa for a lot of those types of things. Since you can kinda do it all in system: http://kortham.net/temp/firefox_GIraSu8DPm.png

[10-Jul-24 10:21 AM] lancercaster#0000
Getting the FET seems like a big investment.


[10-Jul-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, it's not too bad. This is how I do it: You can mix in ASMs with your SMEs, so that's not too hard to deal with. I buy and import most of my ore anyway since it's so cheap, so making AL/FE/TI/SI in one place is no problem. On Deimos, I only have two ASMs, so it really just reduces the amount of shipping per day I have to deal with for metals.


[10-Jul-24 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
And all the ASM products are pretty handy. There's always a demand in the corp so I have just been sending them to Hern or other members as soon as I get to 100 of any type


[10-Jul-24 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
AST is needed in pretty big quantities for LCBs for ships. The other ones go into other ship components


[10-Jul-24 10:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
HWPs are also metallurgy so they could go on the same planet and you can do all the steps in one place and still get the COGC


[10-Jul-24 10:46 AM] lancercaster#0000
How's this base potentially look? AL is being produced nearby.

Though FET is the limiting factor IMO...:spinthink:


[10-Jul-24 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah looking at the plan, I think that's pretty good.


[10-Jul-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
And I think we, as a corp, will commit to buying a lot of AHP each day, (right everyone..???)


[10-Jul-24 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
And you can always flip to make other plates (although LHP go a lot faster, and that would be a problem)


[10-Jul-24 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
I imagine if you ended up with a few hundred on the CX, ie: enough for someone to make a ship out of them, they would start selling on the CX


[10-Jul-24 11:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'd totally front the cost and post them myself if you end up with more AHP than you can sell


[10-Jul-24 11:09 AM] lancercaster#0000
Thinking about it 14 and a quarter doesn't sound too bad considering an advanced ship should only use 100 and those aren't built every day.


[10-Jul-24 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. Today's patch will really shift things regarding AHP usage


[10-Jul-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
AHP makes sense with the high end ships


[10-Jul-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
if you pay for all the shields, you're losing a ton of money if not using AHP


[10-Jul-24 11:14 AM] hernanduer#0000
vs just using LHP with no shields


[10-Jul-24 11:15 AM] archielvahr#0000
Having the weight nearly halved (17t to 10t) for AHP is really nice


[10-Jul-24 11:15 AM] lancercaster#0000
Oh! Just saw the patch notes on AHP. That's a big buff


[10-Jul-24 11:16 AM] lancercaster#0000
I mean. All hull plates were buffed but AHP got the best one.


[10-Jul-24 11:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
now it's just equivalent to the old BHPs


[10-Jul-24 11:16 AM] hernanduer#0000
which is fine enough


[10-Jul-24 11:27 AM] akyantor#0000
Does that mean now it makes sense to switch to AHP, and stack ships with all the specialised shields? *Just tried it in the sim, and doing this reduced damage taken to 0.08% vs 0.32% on a sample journey, almost a 75% reduction of damage (which doesn't including the savings on now less frequent repairs)*


[10-Jul-24 11:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
I will be doing it for my new ships. Swapping existing ships is a little less cost effective, but I will probably do it also eventually, just to save on repair times


[10-Jul-24 11:30 AM] archielvahr#0000

Vulcan is normally the alternative, same system.

Can't do. Already have a base there.

An alternative option for metallurgy a lot further out, is WU-070a.

I‚Äôve my glass factory there


[12-Jul-24 09:05 AM] lancercaster#0000
Out of the way, but it'll have to do.


[12-Jul-24 09:06 AM] akyantor#0000
It at least doesn‚Äôt have any special build requirements, so is cheap to setup.


[12-Jul-24 09:07 AM] akyantor#0000
It‚Äôs pretty much a full tank of FTL fuel out and back for a starter ship though

I think there are about 6 OOG members there


[12-Jul-24 09:07 AM] lancercaster#0000
I'll also need to pay for Technicians and Engineers...


[12-Jul-24 09:08 AM] lancercaster#0000

[12-Jul-24 09:10 AM] akyantor#0000

ZV-194d, IY-816c, KI-401b


[12-Jul-24 09:11 AM] akyantor#0000
May be worth checking if any of those have existing stock of tech and Eng.


[12-Jul-24 09:11 AM] akyantor#0000
As the build may be more expensive, but less problematic getting workers


[12-Jul-24 09:11 AM] akyantor#0000
I look after WU-070a, and at the moment there are no other players with tech/engineering requirements, so would take a bit of time to build up


[12-Jul-24 09:12 AM] akyantor#0000
Can be done, of course.


[12-Jul-24 09:15 AM] lancercaster#0000
It's between SE-648a and WU-070a


[12-Jul-24 09:17 AM] lancercaster#0000
None of the nearby planets have engies aside from SE648a and they are near full employment and low happiness.


[12-Jul-24 09:18 AM] lancercaster#0000
Hell even Vulcan doesn't have the ENG I need...


[12-Jul-24 09:18 AM] akyantor#0000

[12-Jul-24 03:57 PM] lancercaster#0000
I think you're right.


[13-Jul-24 10:51 AM] akyantor#0000
I just cooked up a script of doom using FIO data to try to quantify the "real" cost of producing my end of chain materials (as it stands), includes:
- Consumable costs
- Production taxes
- Any purchase costs for materials not in my supply chain that have to be bought from the market
- And any of the above costs rolled up the supply chain where I produce in house (e.g. consumable/production costs for GRN are added to the costs to produce C)


[13-Jul-24 10:52 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh... there were some surprises in there for me... stupid stuff like HAL being surprisingly expensive despite it being a first order material. And that it's surprisingly frequent that the production costs (consumables) can often be more than input materials, even a few levels deep in the supply chain.


[13-Jul-24 10:52 AM] lancercaster#0000
Got a question. I was thinking about moving my HQ from Promitor to Phobos. Any thoughts?


[13-Jul-24 10:56 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess it depends on whether you'd fine the HQ bonus more profitable on Phobos or Promitor.


[13-Jul-24 10:56 AM] akyantor#0000
Doesn't it give a 100% boost?


[13-Jul-24 11:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
Nah it's like 10% I think

because it cuts the time down by 10%, and its' multiplicative with other bonuses, so it ends up being like 16%. Then that means your workforce costs are reduced by 16% on those products too.

[15-Jul-24 07:59 AM] akyantor#0000
I wonder if they didn't bother with space elevators as the first option, as it's a little less interesting. Space elevators just result in cheaper flights. The gateways opening up market / political opportunities, as well as potentially expanding the range of planets that may be viable from distance to CX


[15-Jul-24 08:33 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Gateways shorten distances, effectively bringing more planets closer to the CX


[15-Jul-24 08:34 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I wonder how the gateway connections will work. 1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many.


[15-Jul-24 08:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
it reads like 1-to-many


[15-Jul-24 08:39 AM] hernanduer#0000
but I also think you need a gateway on both sides


[15-Jul-24 08:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
`or expand the radius of potential targets for your gateway.`


[15-Jul-24 08:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
that's what makes me think it's one-to-many


[15-Jul-24 08:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
_potential_ targets, like the person performing the jump can choose where to go


[15-Jul-24 08:41 AM] hernanduer#0000
could be wrong though


[15-Jul-24 09:13 AM] melon164#0000
I read it as 1-to-1 but potentially retargetable


[15-Jul-24 09:15 AM] melon164#0000
regardless, there are still only a handful of places on the map that would be attractive to colonise even if the travel time _was_ greatly reduced...


[15-Jul-24 09:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
far north is interesting


[15-Jul-24 09:24 AM] hernanduer#0000
the two off-center CXs, really


[15-Jul-24 09:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
plus the OS system could become super powerful actually, if travel time is only half a day or something AND with minimal fuel use

{Reactions}

[15-Jul-24 09:25 AM] hernanduer#0000
depends what the cost looks like for the new HF (hyperjump fuel)

(idk the name :D)


[15-Jul-24 09:29 AM] melon164#0000
If it doesn't use at least one of the orphaned commodities I shall be very disappointed üò†


[15-Jul-24 09:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
the breathable liquid would make sense to use as part of gate upkeep


[15-Jul-24 09:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
maybe? idk


[15-Jul-24 10:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Presumably JUI, which was always intended to be part of space travel


[15-Jul-24 10:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
Although they said it was "something new"


[15-Jul-24 10:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
maybe it includes JUI


[15-Jul-24 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
I suspect there will be radius in actual lightyears that the jump works.


[15-Jul-24 10:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
So finding systems that are physically nearby but poorly connected would be the best places for jump gates.


[15-Jul-24 10:41 AM] archielvahr#0000
So candidate shortcuts to OS-099... would focus on avoiding the tangly bits. Unfortunately it's just kinda out there no matter what.


[15-Jul-24 10:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm also reading that the owner of the government of a planet controls the gateway, at least initially


[15-Jul-24 10:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
I think a double hop might make sense


[15-Jul-24 10:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
we basically own Demeter


[15-Jul-24 10:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
we can set Demeter up as the middle point, with a gate from Phobos/Heph -> Demeter then another gate Demeter -> OS


[15-Jul-24 10:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
probably be a lot cheaper than bringing the "range upgrade" on Phobos/Heph to level 7 or 8 or something, if it scales like POPI levels


[15-Jul-24 10:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
we could also increase Demeter establishment taxes to 10mil, to prevent people trying to edge us out

[15-Jul-24 11:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
KI-439 could be a good candidate, or Demeter if it reaches. KI-439 and Elon are right next to eachother on the map but it's like 5 jumps


[15-Jul-24 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Not sure if they are gonna max out at like 1.5 sectors in size or what.


[15-Jul-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
it has to be a place that we can convince inner ANT systems to build a gate to


[15-Jul-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
or we use something like 194d


[15-Jul-24 11:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'd hope at level 10 that we could go from OS-099 to Hubur


[15-Jul-24 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
depends on the speed vs. cost vs. build tradeoffs


[15-Jul-24 11:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
we'll have to see


[15-Jul-24 11:07 AM] hernanduer#0000
but I figure we'd have an easier time convincing the Heph/Phobos/Eos government to make a gate to Demeter than most other planets


[15-Jul-24 11:08 AM] hernanduer#0000
which are basically all Rise right now üôÑ


[15-Jul-24 11:32 AM] archielvahr#0000
Hm yeah, each planet in ANT 1 will probably end up with a gateway going somewhere specific


[15-Jul-24 12:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
they said you could build more than 1 per planet, I just don't like the idea of us funding it and then someone getting a bug up their butt and changing its target through a government motion or w/e


[15-Jul-24 03:08 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Haven‚Äôt been here long enough, is there any intention of developing around OS or just that system?


[15-Jul-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Definitely open to it, it's all under the umbrella of #project-6115


[15-Jul-24 03:10 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Maybe with the gates and the new politic update there could be a reason to build out a region


[15-Jul-24 03:10 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
There is some nice smelting potential around there


[15-Jul-24 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah gates will definitely change the situation, I just don't know how much


[15-Jul-24 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
The big questions are the range and the cost per jump


[15-Jul-24 03:11 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Indont think alot, there are just so many open good planets


[15-Jul-24 03:12 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
There would need to be a 5x player increase to fully saturate the middle for it to become worth it


[15-Jul-24 03:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, that‚Äôs largely true. In a lot of ways. I think I have run out of good electronics planets in ant space. But if I wanted to, I could pick and choose planets out of other regions.


[15-Jul-24 03:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
it‚Äôs kind of fun that we have the new system on complete lockdown. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs actually useful. But it‚Äôs fun

showing only the best (most jumps skipped) gateway path from one region to another region. Otherwise it spams a lot of very similar paths.

[16-Jul-24 12:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
So those red lines are gateways. Generally they are physically closer than they look on my map. Downside with this whole thing is that it doesn't recognize the paths you'd actually want to travel on. So it's a bit dubious in that regard, üòÜ


[16-Jul-24 12:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
I guess the question becomes "What paths save the most jumps to ANT"

For everyone who's encountered the timeout on the project create modal, I'm sorry. It was using the default timeout of 5 minutes and I'm happy to say that it's been bumped to a full hour now. That should cut down on the pressure to type fast a good bit.

If anyone hits the limit still, or anticipates hitting it please give me a shout and I can bump the time up higher.

Hey @parisinspringtime  I accidentally shipped some of the MGS back from Elon to ANT.  I can either:
1) send you 1500 MGS on ANT
2) Send you 900 MGS on Elon + 600 on ANT
3) Send you 1500 MGS on Elon but it takes like.. a couple days


[18-Jul-24 10:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
Likewise for @neth_havoc with the AUO
1) I can do 700 on ANT + 300 on Elon
2) 700 on Elon or 300 on ANT
3) all of it on Elon but it takes a bit longer


[18-Jul-24 10:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
actually I gotta send a few ships to Elons so I could ship some of either back out there, lol

This is my plan for a base. It will be build in waves Starting with BMPs up to x15


[24-Jul-24 11:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
Any suggestions would be very welcome


[24-Jul-24 11:45 AM] marat_sh#0000
Heavy focus on MCG and PE since it's being traded daily. Tried to keep it under 500t per day


[24-Jul-24 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think that's a really solid starting Heph base. And it's a good idea to push to Heph for manufacturing. BMPs are very flexible. So you can totally focus on just a few of those items in order to simplify logistics. MCG is at the MM max price so it will continue to sell at that max price for the foreseeable future.


[24-Jul-24 12:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Total return on investment of 13 days which is pretty solid


[24-Jul-24 12:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
After that focus on components for electronics


[24-Jul-24 12:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
So yeah, I think it's a good plan!


[24-Jul-24 12:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
Now the employment might me in question. I am not sure how population works just yet so we will see


[24-Jul-24 12:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
Good options for growth into making PG also


[24-Jul-24 12:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
Heph and Phobos are both pretty big, so the population will just show up when the population report rolls over once a week. And the workforce pool (which you get immediately) is probably pretty big


[24-Jul-24 12:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
I've got PRO so if anyone wants to help me make this base happened would be very welcome


[24-Jul-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
ah 1500 pioneers. I think you'll get like 400 out of the pool maybe...? The rest should come when the week rolls over. On heph it's 13 hours from now. (or 7d 13hr for the next one)


[24-Jul-24 12:14 PM] archielvahr#0000

[25-Jul-24 08:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
Good question - I haven‚Äôt done much with electronics so hopefully someone else will weigh in. My perception has been that a lot of electronics stuff is traded off the CX since they‚Äôre often components of ship parts and the like. Obviously EDC and IDC is a bottomless pit of money with the MM orders being what they are, but they‚Äôre also not super interesting


[25-Jul-24 08:59 AM] zipatsu#0000
Yeah.... wish I could say that never happened to me but it's definitely occurred more times than I'd like to admit. And it's almost always MCG or TRU somehow, likely from focusing on making sure the expensive stuff is all accounted for üòÖ

[25-Jul-24 10:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
electronics are more for advanced pipelines, because historically the products are low volume or simply lacking on the CX, anyone who needs electronics chooses to setup their own manufacturing of them


[25-Jul-24 10:26 AM] hernanduer#0000
sometimes you can sell them on the CX, but expect orders to sit there for a while


[25-Jul-24 10:28 AM] marat_sh#0000
do you think if electronics where more accessible people would start buying them instead of setting up own production? If they are primarialy used for ships I can understand that though


[25-Jul-24 10:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
maybe, but I wouldn't play that game as a new player üôÇ


[25-Jul-24 10:30 AM] hernanduer#0000

[25-Jul-24 11:03 AM] archielvahr#0000
Nike has the corp headquarters and with the construction COGC it can be a very high efficiency planet for construction. As you transition it makes sense to put some of your highest value buildings there. So starting with PP2s because they use AL instead of FE, and have a big variety of outputs, then eventually transitioning to PP3 and PP4 to make the most out of the corp HQ bonus


[25-Jul-24 11:04 AM] marat_sh#0000
I've seen numbers and PP1 not worth at all So yeah PP2 all the way

{Reactions}

[25-Jul-24 11:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
It is nice to have someone running LST on Nike and selling it locally but it's relatively low profit compared to using it for construction. It would be a sacrifice, hehe


[25-Jul-24 11:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
LST is used in my MCG and late Manufacturing


[25-Jul-24 11:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
Regarding the electronics stuff: I know personally I would buy more intermediate electronics products if they were on the CX.... So there's something to be said for "making the market".. but it's true you'd be sitting on them for a while, which wouldn't be good as a new player. 

But you could pre-arrange buyers, especially in-corp for things like that


[25-Jul-24 11:07 AM] archielvahr#0000
Or there's a trend towards governors buying HD and MHP so you could focus on those, and I think they'd move


[25-Jul-24 11:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
is LST consumption in corp covered by production or some people buy it of CX?


[25-Jul-24 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
Zipatsu and MegaSaberEXE both make a lot of LST on Nike


[25-Jul-24 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
So I think it's pretty well covered


[25-Jul-24 11:14 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
If you need AL, I make a lot of it as well and already move most of it to Nike


[25-Jul-24 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
Actually Katinga makes a lot of LST on Nike too


[25-Jul-24 11:16 AM] marat_sh#0000
Awesome ü§ù For a corps benefit Where would you suggest for me to expand in a future? I don't mind making a sacrifice as long as I don't lose money


[25-Jul-24 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
heh definitely chase the profit for the first few bases. But EPO is always in demand both in general and in the corp, so that's good on the chemistry side of things.


[25-Jul-24 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
On the electronics side, making HDs might be a good one.


[25-Jul-24 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
construction fabs, as mentioned before: those are good, we seem to be short on those, just looking at open orders.


[25-Jul-24 11:19 AM] marat_sh#0000
Chemicals sounds more convincing Since I would be using a lot of PG myself, but yeah construction also sounds nice


[25-Jul-24 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you end up in metals, I think more hull plates work well


[25-Jul-24 11:20 AM] archielvahr#0000
On the chemistry side, if you make PG, you can manufacture it into PSS/DCS and PSM/DCM, as you have started on Heph... and those products end up in a lot of electronics eventually. So that all feeds into an eventual goal, while also being useful in the near term


[25-Jul-24 11:21 AM] marat_sh#0000

Is there a way to search just one channel for one word?  Whenever I do a search, it searches the whole danged server.  It's kind of annoying.

[27-Jul-24 12:01 PM] exeler#0000
I had a bunch of people at work complain about having to switch from teams to zoom+slack. I've never used teams so figured I was missing out on something


[27-Jul-24 12:02 PM] exeler#0000
For searching auctions I usually search for the ticker plus the @ symbol. 

Try searching for INS@, or C@. Assuming you want to search up past auctions


[27-Jul-24 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
then they clearly weren't using the "one drive integration", or actual features zoom offers


[27-Jul-24 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
well going from teams to zoom, I guess they wouldn't know about those features


[27-Jul-24 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
but the "one drive integration" is in quotes, because it's about as integrated as putting a hyperlink in discord


[27-Jul-24 01:57 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
We are going from the google suit to Office and I‚Äôm suprised how after just 2 years the switch is difficult

@archielvahr would you like some PE deliveries in a future?


[27-Jul-24 05:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, just keep sendin em and I'll keep buying them


[27-Jul-24 05:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
do you want me to stockpile them for a bulk trade or send them as they come to ANT?


[27-Jul-24 05:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Whatever's convenient for you. I would happily buy them on Heph or Phobos also, anywhere I have a base


[27-Jul-24 05:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
So you don't need to send extra ships around just for that reason


[27-Jul-24 05:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
most of it in Heph if you want to pick them up from there let me know For now I will send 6.9k PE next morning. They are currently on the way


[27-Jul-24 05:56 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds good!


[29-Jul-24 09:28 AM] hernanduer#0000
I've started using the PMMG item tagging in my planets and by golly does it make it a lot easier to just move all the outbound products over

Depending on your planet you can sometimes just drag all the outputs and call it good


[29-Jul-24 09:49 AM] hernanduer#0000
if an output is an input to another, where does it end up?


[29-Jul-24 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000

You should consider swapping that. Fewer buildings make HSE more advantageous, and Astraeus can support the pop needs of WPL

Not really. There are people who track the active CONS and honestly it's kind of down lately.

nobody sells BLE though


[01-Aug-24 12:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that's true, you might have to make your own


[01-Aug-24 12:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Not a huge market for SIL either but you can do NL and KV when you have TCL available


[01-Aug-24 12:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
The global demand for LC is incredibly low, but the other CLF items seem to move okay


[01-Aug-24 12:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
a bit expensive to start my own production, I would rather buy bulk from people who have Labs

Elon isnt a bad choice for a second or third chem

I know it's not optimal but I don't want to get into other industries. Just my preference of playing this game. If there would be a chem planet on QJ-382, I would place a base in QJ-382a


[01-Aug-24 01:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh yeah, I forgot Elon


[01-Aug-24 01:14 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
its all chem


[01-Aug-24 01:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
like 40% of the game is chem

[01-Aug-24 01:14 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
50%-60% of my income is chem

[01-Aug-24 01:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
unless you really dedicate to only doing metals


[01-Aug-24 01:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
even then, if you wanna use an ASM to its full abilities, you're gonna need AMLs


[01-Aug-24 01:15 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

im still in the middle of it so i can help you avoid some of the mistakes iv made


[01-Aug-24 01:18 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
you can easily drop a new base every 1-2 day for the first 2-3 weeks


[01-Aug-24 01:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
üòÖ  I don't like the idea of owning to someone. I would rather wait and make from my own capital. It's just there isn't that much to do in early game when it's just waiting and I am making different base compositions to look what's viable


[01-Aug-24 01:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
early game is very slow but I also don't want to overwhelm myself with new productions and upkeeps

That's pretty good profit! When I started you'd see ROI of something like 30d, and loans / capital wasn't so much of a thing. But now there is a ton of capital if you want it, and with abundant populations and luxury goods, doubling in 15d is pretty possible. A week is great though üòÑ

[01-Aug-24 01:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
Awesome! There wasn't any BLE on CX that's why I was concerned. Good to know that people have production of it


[01-Aug-24 01:35 PM] mrsmith33#0000
This bit of BLE is like a year worth supply with my consumption of HSS/LC


[01-Aug-24 01:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
sometimes it makes sense to not put items on the CX


[01-Aug-24 01:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
because it increases the entrance costs for competitors


[01-Aug-24 01:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
instead of buying the BLE you yourself make in excess, and then competing with you in HSS with a single manufacturing base


[01-Aug-24 01:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
now they have to make a whole chem base too


[01-Aug-24 01:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
or at least allocate from somewhere else on an existing base

looks a bit overpriced


[02-Aug-24 10:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
do people buy them?


[02-Aug-24 10:40 AM] akyantor#0000
It looks like someone bought 5000 of stock in one day a week or so ago, which is massively more than usual.


[02-Aug-24 10:41 AM] akyantor#0000
I suspect that's resulting in undersupply on the ask side of the order book

[02-Aug-24 10:41 AM] marat_sh#0000
SUN fills like a waste of C


[02-Aug-24 10:43 AM] akyantor#0000
The public order flow for sun is very thin. I did think about making some at one point, but feels a lot less reliably required than OFF. Office Supplies are required for some important plantary infrastructure buildings upkeep.


[02-Aug-24 10:44 AM] marat_sh#0000
That's why OFF is always filled but not the SUN


[02-Aug-24 10:44 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, also more expensive to make


[02-Aug-24 10:45 AM] akyantor#0000
It can often be cheaper long term to upgrade the pop infrastructure to a higher level and just use OFF, rather than feeding the building both OFF and SUN.


[02-Aug-24 10:46 AM] akyantor#0000
It's a bit situational if that's true or not, but if you're on a planet with just demand for PIO and SET pop, then you'll often see only the DW and OFF filled on population infrastructure, as they're cheaper.


[02-Aug-24 10:46 AM] akyantor#0000
The situation can be a bit different on more planets with more complicated needs, but naturally there are fewer of them.


[02-Aug-24 10:47 AM] marat_sh#0000
C is used in so many places but fertile planets you can count on hand


[02-Aug-24 10:48 AM] marat_sh#0000
10 C for SUN recipe feels out of place


[02-Aug-24 10:48 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, you can make the argi goods to produce C on non-fertile planets, but it's more expensive. You have to use HYF with NS and a lot more water, rather than a smaller amount of water on a fertile planet.


[02-Aug-24 10:50 AM] marat_sh#0000
I can start producing OFF as well of you guys need it


[02-Aug-24 11:02 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's pretty hard to see what's in the demand when large portion of trading is behind deals in the dark


[02-Aug-24 11:02 AM] marat_sh#0000
or when people just produce stuff for themselves


[02-Aug-24 11:04 AM] akyantor#0000
I don't think you'd lose out by making OFF. Generally good profit margins. There's demand within the corp too. I've never had trouble selling within the group, albeit at a discount to market, as many folks need it as governors. As an example, 5 bidders for this one recently: https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1085624056562335755/1265421564292366388


[02-Aug-24 11:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am saying about other goods Not specificaly OFF


[02-Aug-24 11:05 AM] akyantor#0000
Ah, fair enough.


[02-Aug-24 11:05 AM] marat_sh#0000
Plus If I sell OFF for 75/u that would be a loss


[02-Aug-24 11:07 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm using my own supply of EPO and PG, which makes it doable to offer at that price.


[02-Aug-24 11:08 AM] marat_sh#0000
Back to the point I was making üòÖ When people produce for themselves


[02-Aug-24 11:11 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, most intermediate materials are overpriced if you only account for consumables + base repairs. That's why I started out making most intermediate materials EPO, C, PG, PE, before attempting to make anything at the end of a production chain.


[02-Aug-24 11:11 AM] akyantor#0000
There's a lot of money to be made in those goods before working up to making end products.


[02-Aug-24 11:12 AM] akyantor#0000
It may be a little less satisfying than making stuff you can use yourself directly, but it was a good way for me to build up at the start. *I'm only 100-ish days in myself, and that's the route I went*


[02-Aug-24 11:14 AM] marat_sh#0000
It's just frustrating that game about trading and economy having central location for trading and it's not even reflecting actual demand/supply in full extant


[02-Aug-24 11:14 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh... that's somewhat true of the real world markets. A lot of trade isn't via an open market. üôÇ


[02-Aug-24 11:14 AM] akyantor#0000
Even in equity trading that's true.


[02-Aug-24 11:15 AM] marat_sh#0000
true but in real world you are not locked behind permits and there isn't 200-300 companies active


[02-Aug-24 11:16 AM] akyantor#0000
There are some indirect ways to see production/demand. If you have a look at the LEAD command, you can use that to see the top 20 producers for a particular good.

[02-Aug-24 11:16 AM] akyantor#0000

I've used this to understand the dark market for goods. i.e. would what I be making materially change the supply/demand based upon the numbers already in production.

Most of the time the answer is no.

Hello all, i'm interested in starting a bank to compete with lowstrife. The idea is to take deposites from large established players and loan it out to smaller players at a higher interest rate.


[03-Aug-24 10:24 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Out of curiosity, would any here be interested in depositing some cash. Before I post in the UFO server I might as well start here


[03-Aug-24 10:26 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
The idea would be that cash is deposited for 10-12 week as an interest loan at 1 or 2%. At the end of the period, the cash is either given back or re-invested for another period

Jokes aside, How many new players take loans? and how many of them are successfully repay it? Or play the game long enough to repay it


[03-Aug-24 11:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
according to lowstrife's posts for his loan setup, almost all of them get paid back


[03-Aug-24 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think it's a good idea but I am low on liquid cash, I keep spending it on neat projects, heh


[03-Aug-24 11:17 AM] hernanduer#0000
Not sure if he does some kind of vetting process


[03-Aug-24 11:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
also the OOG bank can guarantee your money at 1%/w, I think, and it's got a lot more solid backing


[03-Aug-24 11:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
since it's based on the electronics bases


[03-Aug-24 11:32 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
From chats I have had, there is quite a bit of demand for loans


[03-Aug-24 11:32 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
People just don‚Äôt know who to ask apart from lowstrife


[03-Aug-24 11:49 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
lowstrife as stated he gets 2-3 request per day


[03-Aug-24 12:17 PM] marat_sh#0000
is IDC a free money printer?


[03-Aug-24 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yep


[03-Aug-24 12:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
*cough* I would like to get a loan for 20 mil *cough*


[03-Aug-24 12:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
There's a lot of vetting and advertiing and daily maintenence if you were to regularly do public loans, and I think we can't automatically put that on allocater, so having a bank for that purpose specifically run independently by someone is a pretty good opportunity. There's also probably opportunities for cross-funding. Real banks loan each other money with a weird frequency


[03-Aug-24 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think there's a ton of capital in OOG player accounts but it would need someone to manage the loans (and maybe assume the liability)


[03-Aug-24 12:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
If Shrewdsun wants to take deposits, he can offer different rates for them based on which ones get lost first in the event of too many defaults


[03-Aug-24 01:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
Oh yeah, I wasn't implying that the OOGB should change its policies, just that I can invest with them and get safer guaranteed returns, vs maybe only 1% more but (in my eyes) far riskier investments


[03-Aug-24 01:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Indeed, I don‚Äôt think it makes much chance for OOG members


[03-Aug-24 01:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But also talking about it here may bring in some insights on the loaning business


[03-Aug-24 01:25 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Im mostly at the research phase right now, if it doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea or there isn‚Äôt much market fit, then no reason really to get into it


[03-Aug-24 01:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
This being said, I do think there would be a market for large players to deposit their money for at least some small return


[03-Aug-24 02:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
Archiel, are you content with daily contracts? amount? price? Any feedback? need more? need less? need less often? need more often?


[03-Aug-24 02:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup, it works for me! You can send them less frequently if you want to save clicks. I figure as a new player having the liquid cash is probably helpful for you


[03-Aug-24 02:51 PM] archielvahr#0000

There's also the opportunity for internally driven goals too, stuff like #project-6115

if feel thats just what the game does


[04-Aug-24 03:33 PM] marat_sh#0000
I just think it will make easier for new casual players to stick around more when they engage in dynamic trading world


[04-Aug-24 03:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
all activities happend behind PRO and not a lot are willing to pay


[04-Aug-24 03:34 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
iv heard from the dev that they have 50% conversion to pro


[04-Aug-24 03:35 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
making it more dynamic would in turn make it a different game


[04-Aug-24 03:35 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I like that it is slow


[04-Aug-24 03:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
New players have very little impacts since most trades happens not on CX


[04-Aug-24 03:35 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
thats normal


[04-Aug-24 03:35 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
cant expect every new player to impact the whole economy


[04-Aug-24 03:37 PM] marat_sh#0000
I see what you mean, but I am just giving a perspective of a player who enjoys this kind of games and haven't played enough to become a fan boy "go my team go"


[04-Aug-24 03:38 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
i get that, i just feel like you are expecting a different game that what its trying to be


[04-Aug-24 03:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
Well when I joined it I though it's a trading game + production in space. In reality it's a shadow market simulator with factorio kind of gameplay were inserters are operated through currency

if you get ride of the player to player trade you end up with an idle game


[04-Aug-24 03:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
that's my point! People don't trade and just hoard items


[04-Aug-24 03:42 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
iv got alot of ideas of things they could do but what you are pointing to for me really isnt an issue


[04-Aug-24 03:42 PM] akyantor#0000
I really don't think that's true for the vast majority of players tbh


[04-Aug-24 03:42 PM] akyantor#0000

[04-Aug-24 03:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I hoard things but that‚Äôs just because I don‚Äôt need the money immediately and get a better deal if I sell small bits over time


[04-Aug-24 03:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
you cant design a game where there is no end game players


[04-Aug-24 03:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the fault of the game mechanic, it‚Äôs just economics at work

[04-Aug-24 03:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
Like I said, if people are forced to sell their items since hoarding isn't profitable... we would have had more dinamic trades on cx


[04-Aug-24 03:45 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I dont know you could have that


[04-Aug-24 03:45 PM] akyantor#0000
You wold just switch from people hoarding goods to hoarding cash.


[04-Aug-24 03:45 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
also the markets the new players are in really dont suffer from that


[04-Aug-24 03:45 PM] akyantor#0000
I don't think economically it'd make any difference


[04-Aug-24 03:46 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Like sidepipe said, thats just economics at play


[04-Aug-24 03:46 PM] akyantor#0000
Agreed. The less complicated goods that are accessible to a new player are all highly liquid on the CX... e.g. consumables, intermediate metals/plastics etc.


[04-Aug-24 03:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
All I am saying oversupplying market should have downsides


[04-Aug-24 03:47 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
but it does...


[04-Aug-24 03:47 PM] akyantor#0000
And those goods are very much in demand from those older players. Every time I post an auction or CX post for them they're snapped up invariably by the older players. That's because they've moved on to higher complexity supply chains, and have don't maintain enough capacity for those goods to meet their own demand.


[04-Aug-24 03:47 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
thats the main consideration when planning a base with high profit items

[04-Aug-24 04:58 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'd argue it's emergent market behavior. While you see people put stuff up at really high prices, you're missing the part where the lower part of the market sells out and suddenly they're making the profit they've been waiting on on those goods


[04-Aug-24 04:59 PM] hernanduer#0000
Something like INS has big demand and doesn't go into much, so there's no reason anyone would hoard it. There's not really any reason for anyone to "hoard" anything. There are just people who are waiting for markets to dry up and they can take advantage. Idle items sitting on the top of the ask orders does nothing for anybody


[04-Aug-24 05:00 PM] hernanduer#0000
This happens periodically in just about all markets

I do disagree with using it as a storage, but the costs on the 500k CX storage are really so low it's not even worth the headache


[04-Aug-24 05:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
To be honest I didn't know that CX warehouse could go to 500k... Wow


[04-Aug-24 06:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah 1000 levels * 500 per


[04-Aug-24 06:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
per cx


[04-Aug-24 06:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
you can get 4 of those


[04-Aug-24 06:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
I agree that it‚Äôs bad that there‚Äôs not more liquidity on the CX, but I think part of the problem is that the thinner demand for higher tier items is kinda problematic if you‚Äôre trying to sell them, so you end up with a huge inventory or making big private deals (or a secret side market like ours üòÅ)


[04-Aug-24 06:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I know this is an old discussion now, but I was reading everything while I was at the store and couldn‚Äôt respond üòÑ


[04-Aug-24 06:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
I guess it‚Äôs just tough to optimize for a fun market when there‚Äôs a lot of different ways to have fun with a market


[04-Aug-24 06:59 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
my main counter-argument is that if you could find everything on the CX there would be no point in having a community


[04-Aug-24 07:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, and if we could do private or corporate CXs, there‚Äôd be no point in having a CX. It‚Äôs interesting because in one way, I don‚Äôt want any limitations on how I sell my things, but I also do kinda want a lot of limitations because they make things interesting (to me)


[04-Aug-24 07:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just some general thoughts I had. There‚Äôs been a lot of CX discourse in general, not just here - I usually don‚Äôt participate, but I do read a lot of it üòÑ

Such an interesting discussion was here last night.
When I was playing for the first time it was a lot of enthusiasm all over the UniverseüòÄ , but a lot of players gone after some time due to restrictions with basic licence and lost of interest to the game. 
Returning 2 months ago, I found that prices almost for everything is much higher than it was 2 years ago. In my opinion it gives a lot of opportunities to the new players, as they could start more effective and quicker.

So Scorpy want to start buying I (since it's not on CX)


[05-Aug-24 06:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
CLI sells for 215 (3x 215 = 645 AIC per 1 I)


[05-Aug-24 06:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
So he wants to provide CLI for free (transportation and rocks) and buy I for 400 AIC


[05-Aug-24 06:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
Feels like a fair deal... considering the only thing I am going to lose is potetial profits from products I could have been producing


[05-Aug-24 06:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
For now we agreed to my 12% daily production ( 10 I /d )


[05-Aug-24 07:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
On Heph it costs at least 130/cycle to run that at full experts


[05-Aug-24 07:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
So you'd only be making, at most, 270/cycle


[05-Aug-24 07:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
You can run it about 7.67 times a day per BMP, netting you only 2k AIC per BMP per day

[05-Aug-24 07:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
but it's also a deal from ADI which like a moral value


[05-Aug-24 07:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
A really bad deal, just about any run of BMP will get you twice as much


[05-Aug-24 07:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
that's what I am saying


[05-Aug-24 07:08 PM] hernanduer#0000
Of course, you do save on shipping


[05-Aug-24 07:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
So that's modest cost savings


[05-Aug-24 07:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
+ helping ADI


[05-Aug-24 07:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
12% production isn't that much


[05-Aug-24 07:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
I've told him that it's not going to be permanent deal. I am fine with it for now but I've told him that price would have to go up to make it on par with other products


[05-Aug-24 07:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
If you've received help from ADI then I agree, but I follow very much a take-a-penny, leave-a-penny philosophy


[05-Aug-24 07:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
I do get some items cheaper on ADI

The electronics bonus grows by the ratio of used to unused permits.


[05-Aug-24 10:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yup


[05-Aug-24 10:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
Also, Archiel, how much would be too much PE/d for you?


[05-Aug-24 10:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm, I can use up to ~14k PE per day


[05-Aug-24 10:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you want to specialize in it, others in corp could use more, I'm sure


[05-Aug-24 10:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
I was planning on it. Setting up a base on nike just for PE


[05-Aug-24 10:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
And some consumables


[05-Aug-24 10:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
You might want to do a manufacturing planet. PE has a cheap workforce but the cogc bonus can be really important. Lemme link a cogc example

[05-Aug-24 10:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah Astraeus is the option on Ant 1, it costs a bit more to build there


[05-Aug-24 10:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah, want to put less buildings there


[05-Aug-24 10:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
For now I think it‚Äôs fine to not use COGC until I build capital


[05-Aug-24 10:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
As long as I make money it‚Äôs fine


[05-Aug-24 10:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
Plus I would still get 10% from corp HQ


[05-Aug-24 10:40 PM] marat_sh#0000
and it‚Äôs cheaper to build there


[05-Aug-24 10:40 PM] archielvahr#0000


[05-Aug-24 10:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, those are good points


[05-Aug-24 10:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you can get a heph base earlier,  you can always retool it, there's not much cost in that, especially if you time it to when you'd be repairing.


[05-Aug-24 10:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
So both fair


[05-Aug-24 10:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
For BMPs, the workforce and degradation is very low, so you're mostly just missing out on the 1.25x multiplier.


[05-Aug-24 10:42 PM] marat_sh#0000
My plan for now build up 20 BMPs on heph, place a base on nike and start building BMPs there and slowly replacing BMPs from heph to PPF


[05-Aug-24 10:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which will be the from 128% to 160% (or on nike it will go from 141% to 176%) with full experts


[05-Aug-24 10:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Gotcha


[05-Aug-24 10:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that makes sense to me


[05-Aug-24 10:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
good use of the permit space


[05-Aug-24 10:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yes, plus liquidating as bases grow


[05-Aug-24 10:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
I have enough soon to finish Heph base


[05-Aug-24 10:44 PM] marat_sh#0000

[08-Aug-24 07:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
I would also take 100 bronze on ANT though, feel free to send some over üòÑ whatever price, I dunno


[08-Aug-24 07:59 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I just started making BRO and my supply of CUO is only 2 EXT, probably need to bump it


[08-Aug-24 08:04 AM] mrsmith33#0000
If I double my CUO extraction I could produce 60 BRO/day


[08-Aug-24 08:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ah nice, yeah I can probably only use like 10/d on average. Trying to get a stockpile though


[08-Aug-24 07:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
I've expanded my PE production... It will be more then 9000/d now


[08-Aug-24 07:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
Prunplanner says 12k per day. We will see if it matches my resupply cycles


[09-Aug-24 01:57 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Will you auction it?


[09-Aug-24 06:17 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yes, I will start auctioning, how often do you guys want the auction? I bring PE to CX every day


[09-Aug-24 06:18 AM] mrsmith33#0000
once or twice per week

High-G seats, or maybe heat sielding


[10-Aug-24 04:49 AM] akyantor#0000
AGS is probably the cheap option, just need to figure out if it's worth it


[10-Aug-24 08:44 AM] hernanduer#0000
Unless you're using HTE or AEN it's not worth anything. You could add drones

[10-Aug-24 11:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
Prun on the phone is surprisingly good for what it is, but still really rough to use compared to the desktop interface


[10-Aug-24 12:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Not to bad for quick and easy stuff but buying and loading 10+ things onto ships is not one of them


[10-Aug-24 12:24 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
We got 150mm of rain yesterday so iv got other things to deal with anyways


[10-Aug-24 01:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
I really like the transfer interface actually, since it's just drag and drop on the phone


[10-Aug-24 01:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
What‚Äôs impossible is knowing how much stuff is remaining in a base in terms of days.
But a simple pickup is really quick on the go


[10-Aug-24 03:08 PM] akyantor#0000
That'd work. I'd probably stick it on my starter ship. Thanks.

Just lowstrife is taking 20 mil in losses


[12-Aug-24 06:14 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Insula 17 mil


[12-Aug-24 06:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
He has 25m with me. I was gonna message him.

Yes, he had a pretty high interest rate with me. Not that high.


[12-Aug-24 07:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
At the time I was giving out something like five loans to different people. I had kind of mixed him up with someone else and accidentally gave him a second 10 million loan.


[12-Aug-24 07:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then I think I gave him loan for a ship he bought also

Insula shared me his repayment plan and it wasnt accouting for inputs it seems


[12-Aug-24 07:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahhh oops


[12-Aug-24 07:19 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Based on the Prunplan and his payment schedule, his repayment plan was taking the rough profit, not net


[12-Aug-24 07:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm well I think as debtors we could work something out.


[12-Aug-24 07:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
This interest rates were quite high


[12-Aug-24 07:20 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I know Insula is considering buying the debt from all the debtors and coming to a consolidated agreement with Rim


[12-Aug-24 07:21 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

i make ~1000 excess RATs a day to sell, with 5 bases supporting it (harmonia, norwick, SE-110a/b, ISA)


[17-Aug-24 01:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
but that's 60k/day at corp prices for 5 bases, which is why I make a ton into lux consumables to sell


[17-Aug-24 01:38 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, probably good for new players if the price is a bit higher


[17-Aug-24 01:38 PM] akyantor#0000
given it's a good starting good


[17-Aug-24 01:40 PM] katinga#0000
my FRM base on Harm is part of an AA project.  My FRM base on Demeter is for GRN to fuel my own burners for C so I can smelt my ore.  that leaves my base on Life where I grow CAF, which seems to be the only crop that's cost effective to grow on a HYF base given the cost of NS on the CX


[17-Aug-24 01:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a HYF base that grows HCP for burning. It seems very effective per unit area


[17-Aug-24 01:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
i get that. it just doesn't make a ton of financial sense for me to sink more bases into RAT production at corp prices atm


[17-Aug-24 01:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
not that I don't like giving you all cheap RATs üòÑ


[17-Aug-24 01:46 PM] katinga#0000
*sits down at the table with her reconstituted RAT meal and looks down at it*  Why is there a fingernail in this?


[17-Aug-24 01:47 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I'm fine getting it from the market at this point. üòõ


[17-Aug-24 01:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yes, rats are expansive but I think it‚Äôs not at the point that you can‚Äôt afford cx prices


[17-Aug-24 01:48 PM] akyantor#0000
I'll probably do as @archielvahr has done and move to HCP for burning with a HYF base so I can free up Harm for RAT focused farms, at some point after my current projects.


[17-Aug-24 01:49 PM] katinga#0000
Maybe we could recruit some newbie players and sponsor FRM bases for RAT production.  FRM bases on Harm wouldn't be that expensive to sponsor


[17-Aug-24 01:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've thought about doing something like that. It's just a tough sell because at some point, they'll want to drop FRMs for the same reason most folks do. There's just better things to do with the permits / area / fertility / whatever


[17-Aug-24 01:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
Do I count as a newbie üòÖ? 2.5 mil in equity and 1 full base permit?


[17-Aug-24 01:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
you want a FRM and FP base? üòÑ


[17-Aug-24 01:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
Not really what I want to do myself but I can help out if corp needs


[17-Aug-24 01:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
idk. at the end of the day, you should do what you think is fun because none of us will go broke buying rations from the CX

[17-Aug-24 01:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
but if you're interested, we can figure something out for sure


[17-Aug-24 01:54 PM] katinga#0000
As they get more established in the game, they could set up bases to increase their profits.  but the short term supply of the ag products and Rat production would be alleviated


[17-Aug-24 01:55 PM] katinga#0000
which RAT recipe should be favored though?  there are several


[17-Aug-24 01:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
i guess maybe put slightly differently - I'm not building more FRMs and FPs because there's more profitable things to do. how can I sell to a newbie that they should be building them when I don't want to? üòÑ


[17-Aug-24 01:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
i do GRN, BEA, VEG, with all the high h2o inputs (since I extract my own water and want to maximize output)


[17-Aug-24 02:00 PM] katinga#0000
Hi!  Some members of OOG will help sponsor 1 or 2 bases for you to help with our RAT supply, where you'll have an established customer base and demand.


[17-Aug-24 02:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
Sure, but selling to us at 60/u when you could sell them into the CX at 150/u is a rough deal.

[17-Aug-24 02:03 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah so a full harmonia farm base costs 421k, and makes a profit of 28,683 per day.

[17-Aug-24 02:03 PM] katinga#0000
RATs can also be processed again into FIMs or MEA.  also no reason they couldn't sell some RATs on the CX.  we wouldn't be their only buyers


[17-Aug-24 02:05 PM] katinga#0000
that's not terrible for a new player


[17-Aug-24 02:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hm, I dunno. 15d ROI isn't bad. It's kinda the lowest amount you can make with a full base I think. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  But it's cheap.


[17-Aug-24 02:06 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, in corp price should be higher üòõ


[17-Aug-24 02:07 PM] katinga#0000
A new player could cover that with an ADI grant.  just sayin.  ADI grants are usually around 700k?


[17-Aug-24 02:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
yup


[17-Aug-24 02:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that's 59 of each crop per day with 5 experts. An all FP base costs 780k, uses 137 of each crop per day, and makes 73k per day.


[17-Aug-24 02:09 PM] katinga#0000
the new player doesn't really risk anything, tbh.  and they wouldn't have to sell at 60/u.  I'd easily pay 90 or a 100 a unit for RAT.  the new player still makes a chunk of change.


[17-Aug-24 02:10 PM] archielvahr#0000
So if they had 2 FRM bases, 1 FP base, that's 43k per base. Add a little DW. That's okay. Since harmonia is the only easy farming starter, we'd have to even it out among new players- not everyone gets a FP base probably.


[17-Aug-24 02:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
oops: correction on the FP base. With luxury goods it's 173 of each crop per day, making 91k of revenue.


[17-Aug-24 02:11 PM] katinga#0000
there's almost no ROI to the player on a grant or base sponsorship.  and ADI grant would even cover the HQ upgrades for enough permits


[17-Aug-24 02:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm not 100% sure we can use the ADI grant for that though. It's supposed to be no strings attached

[17-Aug-24 02:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
but if oog wants to sponsor a farming setup, i'm sure we could make it work


[17-Aug-24 02:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
So two possible paths:
1) Tell them, hey here's 750k, build this 13 frm, 7 HB1 base on harmonia and sell the products on the CX until you figure out the game.
2) Try to organize a deal where you provide them stuff and try to get paid back somehow, without strangling the noob's first base.


[17-Aug-24 02:14 PM] akyantor#0000
There's also a chance the market self corrects anyway. AL spiked and has trended down again.


[17-Aug-24 02:14 PM] katinga#0000
I'd be willing to sponsor a few bases


[17-Aug-24 02:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which for me means something like... here's the money up front, but you must sell me your next 1800 BEA/MAI/NUT at half market rate, $110/u. Then if they don't quit early, you get your investment back.


[17-Aug-24 02:16 PM] katinga#0000
I've only seen stuff like RATs go up.  the DW market seems stable, but DW is way easier to make, too


[17-Aug-24 02:18 PM] akyantor#0000
It's about the same price as it was 180 days ago. The low point / anomoly is when it was 70/u in may.


[17-Aug-24 02:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
Do we have extra FP capacity in the corp, or would we need to sponsor that too?


[17-Aug-24 02:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hmm, FPs are a lot easier to come by, so I think it would be easier to manage. I have 2 FP bases and they do a lot of FIM / MEA / DW that could be rations


[17-Aug-24 03:01 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am a new player and my starting base makes 80k per day


[17-Aug-24 03:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ultimately, I think part of the issue is that the way we do our internal market doesn‚Äôt lend itself well to providing an adequate source of basic consumables for every corp member. This group probably uses in the 10,000s of RATs a day (though we do have lots of members that make RATs for their own use), and selling them internally isn‚Äôt really profitable or interesting compared to a lot of the fab inputs / ship parts / fun chem stuff. I‚Äôm all for subsidizing folks to make them if there‚Äôs demand, but that‚Äôs (as you mentioned) a short term solution because they‚Äôll probably want to move on to bases that make more than 20k in profit at some point. Long term, we‚Äôll probably have this problem again

[17-Aug-24 03:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
I was going to ask something similar at some point. So what is the point of corp? My first impression that people work together towards one goal and share the profits between members. In reality i only see order under the market price (which is bad because you are screwing people over with cheaper sales)


[17-Aug-24 03:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm all for subsidizing people who want to farm and make rations, I just don‚Äôt want to get into a situation where we‚Äôre trying to lock people in because we want a guaranteed in-corp supply of something, that‚Äôs all


[17-Aug-24 03:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Imo, the point is that we make the things we want to make, and we bro-price them for people in the corp because they do the same for us üòÑ


[17-Aug-24 03:06 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yes, but it‚Äôs not great in the market based game üòÖ I feel bad for buying C for 500 AIC when it costs 750


[17-Aug-24 03:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
I would say its okay to supply recourses to expand or build projects for cheaper but Inputs and consumables should be at market price


[17-Aug-24 03:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
Well, you don‚Äôt need to feel bad because I buy stuff off of you below market price


[17-Aug-24 03:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
And everyone here is happy to offer the things at the price they list it at


[17-Aug-24 03:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am just giving the outside point of view as a new player. I am still getting used to how things work here


[17-Aug-24 03:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
I felt pretty much the same last December when I joined üòÅ


[17-Aug-24 03:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
Feels like you can't really stay as a little guy indefinitely in this game if you want to expand There is always better apportunities somewhere to be made


[17-Aug-24 03:21 PM] katinga#0000
Here's another point to consider, especially for newer players.  The difference between money trickling in, or instant liquification.  A new player can sell 1000 widgets to corp, at 80/unit (just for the example), and get 80k in their pocket on the spot.  Or, he can sell those same widgets on the CX at 100 /u, but the money trickles in... because players in this game will buy 20 here, 300 there, then this guy buys 5.  That player might make more money but it comes in more slowly.  Sometimes over days.  There is a lot to be said for cash in hand.  The other option is that same player sells the 1000 widgets at a lower price anyway, because he can liquidate it faster by filling the green orders from other players.


[17-Aug-24 03:24 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh for goods like RAT/DW the market moves fast enough that liquidation at spot isn't going to be all that slow.


[17-Aug-24 03:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs kinda what I mean, @akyantor - corp market works great for a lot of goods, but the basic consumables don‚Äôt have a liquidity issue

{Reactions}
üëç 

[17-Aug-24 03:27 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's right. For example NR market doesn't move all that often on the CX, but I've not had a problem selling to corp mates via auction.


[17-Aug-24 03:28 PM] akyantor#0000
More than happy in that case to trade speedy sale for a discount to corp, particularly as a relatively new player.


[17-Aug-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
In exchange I often get more niche components for stuff like HQ upgrades, which would be expensive or harder to get on the CX.


[17-Aug-24 03:31 PM] marat_sh#0000
I think it would also be a good idea to 'order' items that you not really producing but willing to pay X for Y items in Z time


[17-Aug-24 03:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
Since people not really using contract deadlines that often (at least I haven't seen) and just close contract on the same day


[17-Aug-24 03:34 PM] marat_sh#0000
Lets say you need 40 PSLs but nobody is producing them since it's not profitable to constantly produce them or produce them and wait for a sale. You can order the amount you need for the period you need


[17-Aug-24 03:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
At the end of the day, the point of the internal market is to help you all expand fast, because we all benefit when you expand üòÑ

I'm making a lot of extra agri products these days, just hiking them up on the CX


[17-Aug-24 07:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
Also HYF bases are great if you wanna make the NS yourself on 639d, it's cheap to do.


[17-Aug-24 07:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
I only spend like 60% time there making NS, still have room for MED and IND and other stuff


[17-Aug-24 07:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
Then I take all that NS and fuel an entire HYF base with it


[17-Aug-24 07:09 PM] hernanduer#0000
Then that fuels like 1.5 full FP bases, of which I now only use like .5 of


[17-Aug-24 07:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
I have Harmonia for GRN and Demeter for ORCs and HER


[17-Aug-24 07:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
I'm pretty happy with the setup, would recommend FRMs only for GRN and HER though


[17-Aug-24 07:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
The margins on HYF are lower but obviously it's about valuing the permit


[17-Aug-24 07:13 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
whats the per permit profit? was never able to make it worth. I do have a harmonia doing FRM/HYF into C but that harmonia base is abyssimale and heavy on the logistics


[17-Aug-24 07:17 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay let me bust out some math real quick


[17-Aug-24 07:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
okay so
.3 of a permit to make NS (including N from RIGs on 639d), that gets you 128 NS
1 permit of all HYFs running only 1:1:2 of ALG:MAI:VEG gets you 245 of each and  eats 122 NS
1 permit of FP eats 180 agri products and makes 1800 RAT/d
.75 permit to make the H2O to feed the HYFs


[17-Aug-24 07:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
assuming linear expansion of the RAT base to eat all agri products, you can use about another .35 permit


[17-Aug-24 07:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
so 1.35 permit of RAT production from the other .75 + .3 + 1 = 2.05 permits feeding it


[17-Aug-24 07:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
now how many permits does it take to get RAT production from FRM?


[17-Aug-24 07:23 PM] hernanduer#0000
hold on, more math


[17-Aug-24 07:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
assuming you go BEA:GRN:VEG, you'll need 3.7 bases on fertile planets to equal the output from the single HYF base


[17-Aug-24 07:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'll need less water, only 800, which equates to about another .4 permit


[17-Aug-24 07:26 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
hum, yeah it does make a bit a sense. I guess i always looked at it from the lense of C production


[17-Aug-24 07:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
so in total, to use FRMs to equal, you'll need 4.1 bases


[17-Aug-24 07:26 PM] hernanduer#0000
vs 2.05 bases


[17-Aug-24 07:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
and 4 bases on fertile planets at that


[17-Aug-24 07:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
enjoy those logistics


[17-Aug-24 07:27 PM] hernanduer#0000
for C production, I don't know really, I've never made C in my entire time


[17-Aug-24 07:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
How much money does that make? my Harmonia + Etherwind gives me a combined 100k and i wouldnt build that today


[17-Aug-24 07:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
so the end product is the same, 1.35 bases worth of RATs


[17-Aug-24 07:28 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
per day*


[17-Aug-24 07:28 PM] hernanduer#0000
about 2450 RAT/d


[17-Aug-24 07:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
but in one case, you spend 2.05 + 1.35 = 2.4 permits to make 2450 RAT, and the other case you spend 4.1 + 1.35 = 5.45 permit to make RAT


[17-Aug-24 07:30 PM] hernanduer#0000
there are no extra products in these calculations, they're all narrowed down to the only end product being 2450 RAT


[17-Aug-24 07:31 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
my main things i guess is id just buy it from the CX and keep my permits to do some PP3


[17-Aug-24 07:31 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
and inputs


[17-Aug-24 07:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
well then you get back to volume and movement


[17-Aug-24 07:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
rfabs don't really have a big market


[17-Aug-24 07:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
they sell but it takes a while


[17-Aug-24 07:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
and you also have to account for all the inputs to the PP3s


[17-Aug-24 07:35 PM] hernanduer#0000
assuming you make them, they too can be a lot (of permits)


[17-Aug-24 07:36 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
indeed, each of my PP2/PP3 bases need 4/5 input bases


[17-Aug-24 07:36 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
but they themselve make a bit


[17-Aug-24 07:36 PM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, in theory most things will be roughly balanced


[17-Aug-24 07:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
2.4 permits for ~350k in revenue, maybe 300k in profit


[17-Aug-24 07:37 PM] hernanduer#0000
it's a pretty good deal in my book


[17-Aug-24 07:37 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
thats quite good indeed


[17-Aug-24 07:37 PM] hernanduer#0000

how do you get 1800 rat? i can only get 1400


[17-Aug-24 07:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
did you forget experts?


[17-Aug-24 07:44 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
i put 4 in


[17-Aug-24 07:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
5 is a big difference


[17-Aug-24 07:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
even 4 is 1630


[17-Aug-24 07:44 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
i put them in agri...


[17-Aug-24 07:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
oh lol ya

[17-Aug-24 07:45 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
because im getting 105k on the FP base and 30k on my current harmonia


[17-Aug-24 07:46 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
and ideally id just cut harmonia


[17-Aug-24 07:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
Probably not great, very few people regularly sell agri


[17-Aug-24 07:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
Not great, basically all agricultural products are vertically integrated


[17-Aug-24 07:47 PM] hernanduer#0000
Though like I said, I'm selling a lot now


[17-Aug-24 07:48 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
just that hit on the agri planet is hard to swallow when i could just make pg or cl for cheaper and less ships


[17-Aug-24 07:48 PM] hernanduer#0000
About 80/d excess


[17-Aug-24 07:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
the last bases i dropped are these all fed with a single LCB so hard to dedicate a ship to FP/AGRI when that the alternative

[17-Aug-24 08:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd argue the whole 105k FP + 30k FRM can be treated as 135/2 per base since there's no other way to get FPs running. But the shipping would definitely be an issue if you're limited

Indeed in terms of $/permit


[17-Aug-24 08:02 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
My main thing with shipping isn‚Äôt really the number of ships but reducing my required playtime filling ships


[17-Aug-24 08:02 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
This being said a major disadvantage of 6-7 bases per ship is the amount of stock you need as there is a 2-3 week lag between raw input and final product


[17-Aug-24 08:03 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Been really hard on the cash flow, particularly the PP3s


[17-Aug-24 08:03 PM] marat_sh#0000
Imagine 'automated transportation'


[17-Aug-24 08:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
XIT actions but for loading ships would be amazing


[17-Aug-24 08:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
or a feature from the devs. recurring shipment


[17-Aug-24 08:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
They've been given clear boundaries that if it does an action for you then it's cheating


[17-Aug-24 08:11 PM] hernanduer#0000
It can only aggregate data and redisplay it


[17-Aug-24 08:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
Well running 20+ bases doesn't look that appealing in that case lol


[17-Aug-24 08:12 PM] hernanduer#0000
And I'll let you know that ships are cheap when a permit is 25mil

I use fio's burn page to do all of my base feeding, tbh if that ever breaks I'd probably stop playing


[17-Aug-24 08:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
I do have free time to play this game now but as soon as I become busy... I would just not gonna have enough time to do resupply runs


[17-Aug-24 08:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
It only takes maybe 10 minutes in the morning for me


[17-Aug-24 08:14 PM] hernanduer#0000
Sometimes if I'm antsy I do it at night too for any flights that were shorter


[17-Aug-24 08:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
damn thats good, I thought it would be way worse


[17-Aug-24 08:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
well I guess you know what you are doing


[17-Aug-24 08:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
8 ships, I scan the burn page, if base is below 10 days supply I check what it needs, make sure the return products make sense for the given ship, and send it off


[17-Aug-24 08:15 PM] hernanduer#0000
Now I'm using pmmg flags to mark return items so I don't even need the burn page for that part, just my computer browser


[17-Aug-24 08:16 PM] hernanduer#0000
It saves my energy for exciting things, like 6115

To answer the INC question: 
http://kortham.net/temp/firefox_2024-08-17_20-38-58.png

ISA makes 1500 water per day, Thalassa B uses 1000 H2O and makes 600 HCP, Thalassa D uses 300 HCP and makes 300 C per day. 

So 1 HYF base with HCP feeds two INC bases.  that comes up to me as:
INC base gross profit 218k each... even if you write off the extra 500 water that's 440k for 4 permits minus workforce costs.

[17-Aug-24 08:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
MUS in a HYF is really good. 12 MUS in 8 hr. I am pretty confident in the MUS/ NUT/MAI recipe


[17-Aug-24 08:44 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Same 10-15 min at 20 bases


[17-Aug-24 08:45 PM] hernanduer#0000
But then you gotta use FRM to make NUT


[17-Aug-24 08:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I have some FRMs on demeter still, although I've been running off supplies and bought NUTs lately

Speaking of damage, I am now below 80% what‚Äôs the worst than can happen?


[18-Aug-24 06:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
you go 20% slower and it's getting bigger ooooooo


[18-Aug-24 06:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
Ant 3 has bad meteroids I think


[18-Aug-24 06:21 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
is it basicly linear to the damage? so 60% is 60% of the speed?


[18-Aug-24 06:22 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
iv got 2 at 75% so that would be 33% slower i guess


[18-Aug-24 10:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
just use BTF to see an undamaged flight path and compare


[19-Aug-24 06:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
how often PSM or PSL is being used?


[19-Aug-24 06:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
There is no offers on PSM so I think I will start producing some


[19-Aug-24 06:51 PM] archielvahr#0000
I use a lot of PSM but it's definitely only used in the high end stuff like unit prefabs, bridges, and fancy electronics


[19-Aug-24 06:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
outside of manufacturing I see it's only used in prefabs


[19-Aug-24 06:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
I assume prefabs are not used that often


[19-Aug-24 06:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
PSM > DCM > BWS which goes into a handful of important things. But I make mroe APF products than most people


[19-Aug-24 06:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
same for PSL > DCL > BMF, that makes LOG, FFC, LIS


[19-Aug-24 06:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
basicaly high end stuff and not day to day consumption


[19-Aug-24 06:54 PM] marat_sh#0000
I see


[19-Aug-24 06:55 PM] tuffyless#0000
Both used in UPF products too.  Like CQL's


[19-Aug-24 06:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I might also make an OOG centric one, just to try to get our new folks into making DEC and ASM products and things I need ü§£


[20-Aug-24 10:33 PM] marat_sh#0000
I've maxed out my Heph base (area) so far and thinking about second base. Romulan-a to transfer my bmps there or start a chem planet (not really want it since I want to stay Manufacturing only to promote trade with less vertical integration) but it would make sense to go chem route.


[20-Aug-24 10:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
You could consider chem for making DEC üòâ


[20-Aug-24 10:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
But chemistry in general is a safe bet for a second base. TRU and MHP could also be interesting (I think those count as manufacturing, but I could be wrong)


[20-Aug-24 10:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
If I ever do chem building they will be PG - > PPF and PG / TCL - > KV / NL


[20-Aug-24 10:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
Hmm, Agamemnon or Griffonstone would be a good option


[20-Aug-24 10:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think TRU and MHL are both construction in WEL

You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve never done manufacturing, just a simple farmer and headphone maker üòÖ

{Reactions}
üòÜ 

[20-Aug-24 10:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
But if you‚Äôre not looking to vertically integrate, a chem base might actually be a good idea. Or at least manufacturing that uses different inputs than what you‚Äôre using right now, so you can diversify a bit

Getting started in Antares | OOG Capital Management
There are many ways to get started in Prosperous Universe that are better than a farming start on Promitor.

There's a good chance the price of H2O will rise in the near future as people have been stocking up on way too much of it lately leading to me selling roughly 50~70k per day on ANT online for the past 1 - 2 weeks or so which is starting to become impossible to sustain even with my ships running at max speed constantly.  In contrast, my 100k CX buy orders take about 2 weeks to reach 50% fulfilment if not less so it's mainly my own H2O being sold with some of my LM orders on ISA/EW/Boucher getting picked up every now and then.

It's possible that trying to supply 3 CX's at the same time may have been slightly overambitious üòÖ  but it's been (and is) fun to do. I'll continue trying to keep it stable hoping that the demand will slow down a bit soon, giving me some time to build up reserves, but with the way it's been trending I wanted to give everyone here a heads up just in case‚úåÔ∏è


[23-Aug-24 08:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
Makes sense! I wonder if people have been buying it up to make DW


[23-Aug-24 08:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
I could do a 2k/2k shipping order if you need shipping help, I imagine others in the corp could too


[23-Aug-24 08:57 AM] zipatsu#0000
That's definitely a possibility with the rising prices of DW üòÑ


[23-Aug-24 09:04 AM] zipatsu#0000
Appreciate it and will keep it in mind but it's more that most of it evaporates within a day of the ships landing on the CX, I am getting close to being able to afford another full H2O base (if the huge order somehow gets filled through corp prices ü´£) which would help a little once it's fully setup but the main ''issue'' would still be the demand being higher than all my ANT focus rigs can supply üòÖ

[23-Aug-24 09:08 AM] zipatsu#0000
Have been considering dropping support for Benten as I only have one base in the OY region that ships it to ARC and then kinda relies on random players hauling it from ARC to BEN, I could instead try to get that to move to ANT instead but that would currently cause BEN to run out of H2O on the CX which would be a shame


[23-Aug-24 09:12 AM] zipatsu#0000
It's challenging to keep things supplied but it does keep me logging in to the game several times a day üòÑ

Which huge order were you waiting on for the upgrade?


[23-Aug-24 09:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
I was scrolling through the channels but I couldn‚Äôt find anything üòÖ


[23-Aug-24 09:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
I do also have 30k water I can bring to the CX, but I imagine that‚Äôs still a drop in the bucket (pun entirely intended)


[23-Aug-24 09:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have 20k coming that I'll list on the CX at 31. I see some other corp members have some stored in the CX too.


[23-Aug-24 09:26 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's fun to kinda set the price üòÑ

I'm definitely a buyer of H2O. I dropped most of my inhouse production alongside my FRMs to maximise output


[23-Aug-24 09:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
I haven't dropped my production, but I've definitely gotten lazy on shipping since it can be had at a fair price at the CX üòÖ


[23-Aug-24 09:53 AM] zipatsu#0000
At this point any amount helps really üòÑ


[23-Aug-24 09:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
Yeah I've got well over 100k sitting at 35


[23-Aug-24 09:55 AM] zipatsu#0000
+ however much it'll cost for the planetary stuff.  Should be pretty close to being able to afford it all at once ‚úåÔ∏è It'll be a fairly big order though, don't even think there's that much ABH on the CX lol

You dont' have to match other folks

They're probably prices for folks with the whole supply chain

so they just get PG for waaaaay less then it worth basically wasting their permit for availability

Sorry for side track üòÖ Does that price looks fine to you? We can lower it if I get PG from other sources other then CX

[23-Aug-24 06:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I do have money I can spend when compared to you so paying more than other people offer in the corp is just fine


[23-Aug-24 06:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
Sorry man üòÖ  So my reasoning for that price: Lower then current ASK on CX + Margin is around the same I am making right now from other products


[23-Aug-24 06:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
I will send you some PSMs tomorrow


[23-Aug-24 06:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
and starting production of PSLs today


[23-Aug-24 06:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
We can work on getting the price lower later if that makes you feel better


[23-Aug-24 06:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah sometimes new players are too quick to put their products on discount, when we want them to be making enough to grow


[23-Aug-24 06:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
especially like when I joined.. 850 days ago. Those discount bfabs I bought were a huuuuge boon... I think at the time they were basically at cost.  but if I made stuff at that price, I'd never get a third base


[23-Aug-24 06:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
It's not about feeling better it's just hard to see what is fair since PSM and PSL is not traded daily so it's hard for me to judge what is a good price for item


[23-Aug-24 06:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
like I want it to be sold and I don't want to rip you off


[23-Aug-24 07:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've been leaning a bit more on the Cost of Goods calcs lately:

I have a spreadsheet that does the same thing ignoring CX prices and instead chaining together the costs


[23-Aug-24 09:21 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think that's the primary fault with prunplanner's cost calc, it's basically useless for determining costs on niche products


[23-Aug-24 09:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
I was looking into SCA's items


[23-Aug-24 09:21 PM] marat_sh#0000

[24-Aug-24 10:56 AM] marat_sh#0000
let me know if it's worth for you


[24-Aug-24 10:57 AM] marat_sh#0000
consumption is pretty big so I assume it's better to just upgrade and fullfill cheaper goods


[24-Aug-24 10:57 AM] marat_sh#0000
but if it's short term you might want to calculate if it's worth it


[24-Aug-24 11:00 AM] marat_sh#0000
OFF would be like $6400 per day and STR $16800 per day (lvl 8 inf)


[24-Aug-24 11:00 AM] marat_sh#0000
long term STR not worth it


[24-Aug-24 11:35 AM] katinga#0000

[24-Aug-24 07:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
My fought process was that new players wouldn‚Äôt probably go manufacturing since they are new and don‚Äôt wont complicated stuff and would probably go farming or smelting that are pretty straightforward


[24-Aug-24 07:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
So there would be money to make


[24-Aug-24 07:59 PM] sidepipe#0000

[24-Aug-24 08:00 PM] marat_sh#0000

has anybody traded with Good Food Company yet?

the player krisjanis.liepins often fails to deliver the goods on time.
this is the third contract this has happend.

does blocking a player prevent him from picking up your contracts?

Yeah, I blocked him a while ago - I‚Äôve heard he was a pirate or at least unreliable

I started out making C, moved into plastics (PE, PG, EPO), then rolled into bfab (BBH, BDE, BSE, BTA) & lfab (LBH, LDE, LSE, LTA) production. I'm now trying my hand at ship building creating a production pipeline to make AWH (ship shields, which recently received a buff so may be viable now), still got a bit of work to do before that's up and running.

It‚Äôs not at all expected that folks offer goods via internal prices, particularly newer players.

More useful to build yourself up


[26-Aug-24 11:09 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's more so if you overproduced stuff and you need to dump items to get cash instead of waiting sell orders on CX


[26-Aug-24 11:10 AM] akyantor#0000
I started doing it once I‚Äôd found my feet, and had enough production that offering a discount didn‚Äôt overly impact my ability to further expand.


[26-Aug-24 11:14 AM] xtc69#0000

C after FRM is a good route. Opens options to either go onto metallurgy or  chemistry, both have good money making options


[26-Aug-24 11:15 AM] marat_sh#0000
if you want you can just focus on C since a lot of people here use it


[26-Aug-24 11:16 AM] akyantor#0000
Also a strong option. C price has stayed very strong


[26-Aug-24 11:16 AM] marat_sh#0000
with more people joining even more C will be used

do we have base designs on discord ?


[26-Aug-24 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
mostly there's screenshots on the webpage there or you can make them in prunplanner


[26-Aug-24 11:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
You miiiight want a agricultural base before doing and incinerator/carbon base. But either way works.


[26-Aug-24 11:22 AM] archielvahr#0000
Another option is some good metalurgy designs. If you want to do something more interesting, I know I'd buy a lot of ASM products. So that's a metallurgy base that mixes SMEs and ASMs. And that's something you could ramp up into, like starting with just 2 ASMs and 6 SMEs for example


[26-Aug-24 11:24 AM] xtc69#0000

[26-Aug-24 11:54 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd personally start with C, just as it has a wider range of uses than PE. You're never going to have a problem selling it, and it gives you a broader range of options to branch out as it's used in a wider variety of production lines.


[26-Aug-24 01:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
@archielvahr do you want to make a post on what planets to settle first instead of what COGC they are using. Like aiming at tripple green planet first then low temp planets then low pressure and etc. as well as distance to cx isn‚Äôt that big of a deal if it‚Äôs less then 5 jumps

anyone done a sheet on cumulative "base area-day" profits?


[28-Aug-24 11:42 AM] hernanduer#0000
How much AIC you can profit making a product per base-area per day


[28-Aug-24 11:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
with recursive inclusion of input BAd (base area-day) needs


[28-Aug-24 11:43 AM] hernanduer#0000
I might make a sheet for that if not, I'm curious what market maker gets you the most


[28-Aug-24 11:46 AM] hernanduer#0000
I haven't seen a lot of data or discussion on BAd profit calculations, most people look at time or total profits, but I think with the more advanced players it's THE factor to consider


[28-Aug-24 11:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have been working on it again, actually


[28-Aug-24 11:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
one tip is to work in the area of the production building plus the area of the habitations for the workers

[28-Aug-24 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think there are still mistakes in there though, but the idea is  AIC / unit area / day


[28-Aug-24 12:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
It assumes 100% efficiency, which will need tweaking, otherwise it'll skew stuff.


[28-Aug-24 12:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
But it comes up with IDC => 762.7 AIC / area / day. Multiply that by 500, you get 381,350 per day


[28-Aug-24 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
might be good to add the recursion up the mat tree


[28-Aug-24 12:06 PM] hernanduer#0000

but definitely a good looking start


[28-Aug-24 12:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
probably needs to be a mix of formulas that expand each recipe into its parts and then lookup those parts, and then expand those


[28-Aug-24 12:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
not sure how to do that with sheets off the top of my head though...


[28-Aug-24 12:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
except like 10 or 15 columns with each checking the previous column for mats


[28-Aug-24 12:13 PM] hernanduer#0000
gonna be messy looking


[28-Aug-24 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the multidimensional aspect is pretty awkward. You can see it on the Prod Prices Calc sheet.


[28-Aug-24 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
it needs to check each input material, sum the price for those materials, and the area used to make those, times the quantity


[28-Aug-24 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
But I  have this tool to do a single level of "drilldown"

[28-Aug-24 12:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
So each CC takes that quantity of things, and how much each part of it adds up to, and often those numbers don't really add up


[28-Aug-24 12:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
because at which point do you use the CX price, and at what point do you use your "production price"


[28-Aug-24 12:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you run everything off the production price, you end up with 1/100th the CX price for some things


[28-Aug-24 12:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
so I'm trying to find a way that works


[28-Aug-24 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
I think running on production price makes sense for determining price floors and also, since we're looking at base area-days now, you can compare that to IDC to determine if IDC is _really_ the best MM price


[28-Aug-24 12:20 PM] hernanduer#0000
BAd are a bit cleaner to compare across products I think


[28-Aug-24 12:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
like you don't have to compound "staging profit", saying oh yeah this base exists so I need 30% of the profit on that product


[28-Aug-24 12:22 PM] hernanduer#0000
you can just take the whole BAd and multiply it by some profit percent and that will trickle down to all levels of the feeder mats


[28-Aug-24 12:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
What would be really interesting to me (and probably also quite difficult) would be accounting for how much of your production you use in the chain of bases vs how much you sell on the CX - figure out your COGM on everything based on what you buy as inputs, and evaluate the whole chain in total in base area / day


[28-Aug-24 12:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
Which is a hideously large search space ofc. But it‚Äôd to cool to see ‚Äúideal‚Äù production chains based on maximizing the profit per base / day


[28-Aug-24 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
Not saying you or anyone should do that. It‚Äôs just an idea I had floating around for a while

I haven't actually sold any RATs to the CX in a long while, I just changed all my bases to do 100% RAT for now. Hopefully I'll be able to calm prices down a little, but even two dedicated FP bases isn't a huge part of total RAT production


[28-Aug-24 03:29 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, there's a staggering amount of production out there. I'd imagine most longer termed players at least partially have their own supply.


[28-Aug-24 03:30 PM] akyantor#0000
I'd certainly be tempted when you're in the 20+ bases territory, as it must be a big chunk of your operating costs as every single base consumes it


[28-Aug-24 03:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
this is kinda making me want to colonise SE-751b for more FPs though

There is Hermes for FP


[28-Aug-24 03:35 PM] sidepipe#0000

Demeter seems farther?  I grow GRN out there for C production.  it takes over a day to get out to Dem from ANT.  I have 2 bases in the SE-648 system that doesn't take that long to get to


[28-Aug-24 03:37 PM] zipatsu#0000
I will neither deny nor confirm it but I do usually just set the unit price to like twice the current ask and then buy the amounts I need, whatever happens next is out of my hands üòÑ


[28-Aug-24 03:38 PM] zipatsu#0000
I think it's like 5.2k DW & Rat per base for 60 days


[28-Aug-24 03:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
Oh yeah, I mean if I used Hermes for FP, I'd either have to move my HER production off Demeter so I could grow crops closer to it. Most of my crops come from SE-110b, which I think is a pretty long haul to demeter / hermes (which I believe are in the same system / near each other)


[28-Aug-24 03:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
Since Demeter is so far out, growing HER means I only need to make the flight once a month


[28-Aug-24 03:42 PM] katinga#0000
I feel like I am out of places I can grow stuff on


[28-Aug-24 03:43 PM] sidepipe#0000

GRN on Demeter for burners.  CAF on Life for a cash crop.  I can't touch what I grow on Harm


[28-Aug-24 03:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
Thalassa B might still be an option, but it might be rough running 2 HYF bases without a dedicated NS base

And put a puddlejumper there to haul stuff around.

FK-794b for H2O
FK-794c for COF, DW, KOM, ALE, RAT, etc.
FK-794d for CAF, Agri for RAT

Our SE system is nearly same, is just closer to ANT.

and the several 10ks I have on the CX


[30-Aug-24 10:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
well, I'm glad it's not just me üòÇ


[30-Aug-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, apparently my ANT warehouse is worth over 225mil, I'm pretty sure at least half of that is in arbitrarily priced electronics parts


[30-Aug-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
the pieces never really sell, and it used to be you couldn't buy them


[30-Aug-24 10:05 AM] hernanduer#0000
so you'd build them up on individual levels until you get here...


[30-Aug-24 10:05 AM] sidepipe#0000
for the most part, do you have electronics production lines where you make a specific thing? or is it just 10 of this, 100 of that, etc?


[30-Aug-24 10:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
mostly specific things, but the balances are just slightly skewed to excess


[30-Aug-24 10:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
and over 400 days, it builds up to that lol


[30-Aug-24 10:06 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'm actually short on MBs right now


[30-Aug-24 10:07 AM] hernanduer#0000
the trick is, most electronics outputs need to go to APF or AAF, and those just don't have a lot of work to do unless you also make ship parts


[30-Aug-24 10:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
I guess that makes sense. and right now, I couldn't be further from ship parts


[30-Aug-24 10:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
but maybe this is a reason to look into making... idk, something


[30-Aug-24 10:10 AM] hernanduer#0000
seems like there's always space for ship parts on the market


[30-Aug-24 10:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
but I started making MHP to feed Malahat's ever-growing needs, plus a little extra that I could toss on the CX and see what happens


[30-Aug-24 10:11 AM] sidepipe#0000
it's just a very new experience to me to make something that doesn't have a definitive price on the CX üòÑ


[30-Aug-24 10:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
especially since the cost of goods manufactured feature on prunplanner stopped working for me


[30-Aug-24 10:18 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah, electronics are pretty badly like that. You kind of just have to eat the cost until you can sell a bunch at once or make end products


[30-Aug-24 10:19 AM] hernanduer#0000
it's why they should NOT be a starting point


[30-Aug-24 10:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
Electronics are basically made for Manufacturers... and since Manufacturers can just make their own electronics... market is stale


[30-Aug-24 11:52 AM] sidepipe#0000

Hey guys!
I am so exited that I decided to join our corporation!
ANT is really effective space. Most of my bases are close to each other and I made a "line" - ALO from Naskent to Vulcan, metals from Vulcan to Aceland, fabs to ANT.
My ships are traveling full almost each segment.
Hephaestus is so close to ANT, just an hour to fly.
I am happyüòÖ

idk if we have a "kit" but you can buy the parts which you would then take the ship and the parts to a planet with a shipyard and upgrade it

you would in the BP manager make the ship you want to upgrade it to

then in the shipyard menu select the bp you are upgrading from and then select the one you are upgrading to and hit start project

Annoying to lose the GRN in a somewhat tight supply chain. üò¶


[04-Sep-24 08:23 AM] akyantor#0000
Ah well


[04-Sep-24 09:32 AM] sidepipe#0000
How much did you lose, and what crops could you replace it with? I have a ton of spare agri so I might be able to replace it for you üôÇ


[04-Sep-24 09:36 AM] akyantor#0000
It‚Äôs only 500 GRN. More annoying than a disaster.


[04-Sep-24 09:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I have a few thousand GRN


[05-Sep-24 11:02 AM] marat_sh#0000
@.urpalhal I would like to cash out PSM and PSL this Saturday ( need some cash to expand the production )

Thanks, do you want to make contracts on ANT?  Or I can bring the inputs to Vulcan if you need.


[14-Sep-24 12:34 PM] timomurbekov#0000
Better if you will bring it to Vulcan, my 2 ship are busy on some routes and always full on way back to Vulcan


[14-Sep-24 12:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Probably a lot more than 1 bases worth if I keep my UPFs consistently going‚Ä¶.


[14-Sep-24 12:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
This is roughly what I need (it doesn‚Äôt account for what I have, but I‚Äôm gonna input FIO data, decided to to be a big boy and use spreadsheets and not vibes)

My only set responsibility is the bank stuff, which I actually find kinda fun anyway. Plus things have massively slowed down now that allocater restructured the deal


[19-Sep-24 09:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
At the peak I think we were running and supplying 16 EDC bases


[19-Sep-24 09:54 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
What is the bank stuff you are involved in?


[19-Sep-24 09:55 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
You were running the logistics of the Malahat IDC program?


[19-Sep-24 10:11 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yes - I handle all the contracts of the EDC program (not IDC, that‚Äôs self-service) in exchange for a cut per EDC üôÇ


[19-Sep-24 10:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs just because allocater is on basic rn. He does all the other bank stuff üòÑ

He has a pending payment with me due in 2 days


[19-Sep-24 10:21 AM] marat_sh#0000
How to extend it so He doesn't breach the contract?


[19-Sep-24 10:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôll let you extend once you‚Äôre in the final 24 hours


[19-Sep-24 10:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Insula has some work and real life travel stuff going on right now


[19-Sep-24 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
I have some contracts also. I am gonna just keep extending them until he's back, and I'm sure it'll work out fine


[19-Sep-24 10:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you need an advance I can spot you cash

Evo bought the 3 LCBs I listed at 600k and just relisted at 1mil


[19-Sep-24 10:37 AM] hernanduer#0000
I hope no one is buying at that price


[19-Sep-24 10:40 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Probably trying to raise the price of CX ships to stay as attractive as possible for ship buyers


[19-Sep-24 04:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
any use for other PPF recipes? DCM?


[19-Sep-24 04:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
or is it just PSLs and PSMs?


[19-Sep-24 04:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
I use all of them, but I'm fine buying just the PX rather than the DX

Nice discussion


[23-Sep-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
it was a good decision to make a Q&A post


[23-Sep-24 02:12 PM] akyantor#0000
It seems they're back focusing on the gateways work after a brief detour into the community translations. I wonder if it'll land before the end of the year.


[23-Sep-24 03:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
depends... Is the feature working already? or they just working on UI for the feature... I assume that gateway works since Starting from UI and list of materials would be strange. I don't know how much work they intend to put into this feature but if take a summer as a time scale I thing they have 1-2 months worth of work


[23-Sep-24 04:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think ships don't fly through it, but once they are working on a feature and showing new buffers and stuff it usually goes pretty fast

For PMMG Action Packages, can you do `IF ELSE` statements?


[01-Oct-24 05:56 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I would like to do IF there is stock in my ANT warehouses transfer that, ELSE buy it on the CX....

[01-Oct-24 06:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So this will buy 30 days of consumables and transfer it to a ship INV yeah?


[01-Oct-24 06:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
yup - everything the base uses except what you put in the exclusions there


[01-Oct-24 06:13 PM] sidepipe#0000

[01-Oct-24 06:24 PM] hernanduer#0000
do those "Resupply" do a flat 30 days of supplies or does it take just enough to make the current INV of the planet up to 30?


[01-Oct-24 06:25 PM] hernanduer#0000
like if it uses 1 DW per day and there is 10 DW on the planet, will it move 20 DW or 30 DW?


[01-Oct-24 06:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
the second, if you use the base inventory option


[01-Oct-24 06:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
otherwise I think it'll just do the flat 30


[01-Oct-24 07:53 PM] shinonomesciences#0000

uhm you could be?


[01-Oct-24 09:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
does it means the supplies are too old for me to buy?


[01-Oct-24 09:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
You need to have the CXPO windows for those open - that means it wants to buy some from the CX and can‚Äôt access the CXPO window


[01-Oct-24 09:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh naur


[01-Oct-24 09:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Try moving the window - I have had the button show up behind the MTRA window for some reason

[01-Oct-24 09:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[01-Oct-24 09:49 PM] .urpalhal#0000
do I have to hit buy in the buffer with the COF in it?


[01-Oct-24 09:50 PM] .urpalhal#0000
it just inputs price and amount? I can't do it from the action package buffer?


[01-Oct-24 09:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh yep


[01-Oct-24 09:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
not as handy as i thought it would be


[01-Oct-24 09:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well it worked kinda


[01-Oct-24 09:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
It should move the button there


[01-Oct-24 09:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it‚Äôs not worked all the time for me either


[01-Oct-24 09:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
I only use it for loading ships, but I think it does the buy too. I think for purchases you need an CXPO open for each thing you can buy, is that correct?


[01-Oct-24 09:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, you need a CXPO for each and it'll move the buy button to the window


[01-Oct-24 09:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah I needed a CXPO for each


[01-Oct-24 09:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
but it's buggy sometimes


[01-Oct-24 09:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but it was buggy when I was trying to transfer stuff


[01-Oct-24 09:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but yeah i only blew like 1 mil


[01-Oct-24 09:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[01-Oct-24 10:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
but hey at least I didn't have to alt tab 980135317 times to buy all the food and stuff for my vulcan base with like all the pops on it

Does anyone know why the BSE price suddenly spiked this month?


[02-Oct-24 10:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
The production was ~ the same as consuption, when someone bought more then production... price stuck at the the point where people bought it last time


[02-Oct-24 10:16 PM] marat_sh#0000
since there is no additional production we are back at ~ the consuption


[02-Oct-24 10:18 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I'm aware of the macroeconomic principles of supply and demand, I was just surprised that such a common commodity would be susceptible to supply/demand shocks.


[02-Oct-24 10:19 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I was wondering if perhaps someone had a big project or something


[02-Oct-24 10:19 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Because the the price had been remarkably stable for the past six months


[02-Oct-24 10:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
probably people use for their own projects and don't sell it on CX as often


[02-Oct-24 10:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
it also happens when there is not a lot of producers (less competition)


[02-Oct-24 10:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
Basically everything in Prun is susceptible to those shocks üòÑ


[02-Oct-24 10:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Most of the bfabs, including BSE has been at their price ceiling for a while (like more than a year)


[02-Oct-24 10:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
The BSE price ceiling (the MM price) was raised recently


[02-Oct-24 10:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
So it went from one ceiling to another


[02-Oct-24 10:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
95% sure about that


[02-Oct-24 10:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
oh yeah bfabs were changed as well in balance patch

[07-Oct-24 09:26 AM] melon164#0000
Don't underestimate the fact that as CEO of an indie game studio with two active playerbases, marketing strategies, and roadmaps, plus the broader overhead of financial policies, investment reports, grant applications, infrastructure maintenance and general shit-shovelling, one morning a week's actual development time is probably about right üò≠

[07-Oct-24 09:30 AM] akyantor#0000
If you're charitable it would seem that they're only getting 1 day of solid focused work on new build dev a week, based on the average dev blog.


[07-Oct-24 09:36 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, there's probably a bunch of unseen work when you have such a small team, responding the support messages, infra maintenance (if they're not using managed services etc.), billing issues etc.


[07-Oct-24 09:40 AM] zipatsu#0000
I think the solution is creating a third game: Spaceship sim, and then merge Spaceship sim & Airline sim into PrUn.  The Airline sim players can be responsible for moving the cargo from bases to a warehouse zone somewhere on the planet from which the Spaceship sim players load it up before moving to other planets / CX's, you can then choose to  pay the premium to get proper qualified players hauling your cargo or try to save some credits at the risk of BobThePilot crashing into the treeline (potential idea for a 4th game based around cargo recovery right there ‚úåÔ∏è )

Is there any demand for SCA recepies? Or should I continue expanding printers?


[08-Oct-24 10:59 AM] hernanduer#0000
SCA has heavy vertical integration I think


[08-Oct-24 11:06 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah In that case I will just expand printers and textiles


[08-Oct-24 04:16 PM] marat_sh#0000

Yep, you can build the STO building for extra base storage


[11-Oct-24 06:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I usually put one on each base, two if I'm doing something really heavy

Surely it'd make inter-CX trading much more efficient if you could post an ad on the local market selling volume/weight on a ship leaving and arriving on a specified date


[12-Oct-24 02:42 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I'd probably use shipping more frequently if you can make a single local market order with multiple goods.


[12-Oct-24 04:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm noticing there doesn't seem to be a ton of demand for DDT in-corp right now. I'm considering switching my LABs over to something else for a while - is there anything folks need / would buy internally if it were available?


[12-Oct-24 04:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I have 100 days of DDT on Harmonia


[12-Oct-24 04:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have well over 2k DDT in stock right now üòÑ


[12-Oct-24 04:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
it moves reasonably well on the CX, but definitely not at the quantities I make it at. so if anyone happens to need LAB products, give me a shout


[12-Oct-24 04:47 PM] turlorn_angren#0000
i'm also producing way more DDT than i can use.
what would be good alternative LAB products?


[12-Oct-24 04:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
I assume TCL and NR would probably find some use from anyone making rfabs / afabs


[12-Oct-24 04:51 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am expanding my textiles So there will be some use for TCL üòÖ


[12-Oct-24 04:51 PM] marat_sh#0000

If you want to, we can undo that CX trans.


[13-Oct-24 03:47 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Oh no, it's ok. I needed ZIR immediately, and you were the only seller, so that's business. If you want to store it, should should price it higher next time. üòÖ

Still fails.  Do you have enough space for the whole lot?  If not you‚Äôll need to divide it up

You still won‚Äôt be able to receive more than can fit in the warehouse, as you can‚Äôt receive to a ship

How fresh is planet tracker tab in the sheet? It says `6/26/2024`


[14-Oct-24 04:01 PM] akyantor#0000
It's a little stale as it reports I have 10 bases, but I currently have 19. I think from memory the script that collects the data is tricky to run as it needs to make a load of FIO api calls, which often fail.


[14-Oct-24 04:18 PM] xtc69#0000
is there a quicker way to open trade tab ?

But generally you probably only need the basics when you are starting. RAT, DW, OVE, COF, PWO for pioneers. Then on Demios you have your ore, flux and metal. Probably only need like 10 for your first base

They are very stale because 1) FIO doesn't report activity any more and 2) only I can update the sheet because it takes a ton of App Scripts to run, and I run it on my machine, but won't subject anyone else to the app scripts by adding them to the corp sheet

do we have SIL consumers? if yes how much are you consiming per day?


[16-Oct-24 03:28 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I only consumed 4 LC out of my 40 LC batch I once did. So, not much


[16-Oct-24 03:29 PM] marat_sh#0000
Cool! I am gonna start drooping some SIL on CX soon if anyone interested


[16-Oct-24 04:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
Demand is super low, SCI just don't consume that many


[16-Oct-24 04:29 PM] hernanduer#0000
WS is even worse somehow lol


[16-Oct-24 04:30 PM] marat_sh#0000

maybe bigger volume encourage people to buy instead of make


[16-Oct-24 04:57 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I could buy 7 SIL/day off you, how much are you selling it for?

Do you have any more on you? I'll buy 49 off of you at 4600?


[16-Oct-24 05:11 PM] marat_sh#0000
not at the moment I am testing water if there was a demand


[16-Oct-24 05:11 PM] marat_sh#0000

I'll buy all your supply if it's around 4600

the more I look into it the less appealing SIL is... at 4600/u I will be making ~ 9k a day üíÄ as a reference I make ~45k a day from PSMs at 2000/u

What price would you sell it at?

it's not a price problem it's the volume

Yeah, that figures

It's really capital intensive to produce that much RSI

yeap... problem that it's only used in one thing and that one thing is not traded in big volumes


[16-Oct-24 05:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
nvm I'm dumb... it's ~38k per day

Oh never mind that is a horrific price tag


[17-Oct-24 12:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's not awful, but for a whole new planet you are looking at a few mil (COGC, SST, INF, and esp the ADM)

But if you like to travel and want to try a new planet, check out the #project-6115  planets üòâ

In the financial overview, what's the difference between current assets and equity?


[19-Oct-24 11:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
if you mean this one - Equity = Fixed + Current + Liquid - Liabilities

[19-Oct-24 11:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
And then current assets are the value of all the inventory you have, vs liquid which is cash and fixed which is just building values I believe


[19-Oct-24 11:17 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Ah thank, that makes a lot of sense


[19-Oct-24 11:18 PM] shinonomesciences#0000

It makes sense from the dev‚Äôs perspective, I think. If you have limited time, why spend it rebuilding what someone else already built that works?

[20-Oct-24 12:08 AM] sidepipe#0000

[24-Oct-24 12:15 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
I can‚Äôt buy any more because the price of HDs is so high that it‚Äôs actually unprofitable for me to produce LCs, which uses the SIL

Outside of providing a bit of BSE, LST and some Agri mats for the corp my main goal in the game is to provide affordably priced H2O to the CX so I'm using 3 permits on each water base that I have while also posting ads on EW / ISA and Boucher for more H2O + the CX buy order as well. I did run out of stock a while back though which, among other reasons, led to me saving up enough to put up the 1 million H2O listing that I've currently got going. ‚úåÔ∏è

Not entirely sure yet if 45 is affordable enough considering I had it at 31 before but I've not seen anyone complain about it being too high in the chats so far so that's a good sign, possibly üòÖ

I'm not really doing it for profit, more of a desire to supply the CX with all the water it needs for as cheap as I can without it being too cheap that it gets bought out to be sold for more.  That said, I do need some small amount of profit if only just to be able to somehow afford the 100m+ I need for my next base eventually (*assuming Paris and everyone else that's been supplying Afabs at Corp discounts don't tell me to get lost when I show up with the next requst for ~2k Afabs *üòÖ) 

On ANT I'm currently selling it for 45/u and buying it for 44.90/u so it's .10/u per sale from there, then on the planets that I list buy orders on I list them at 385k/10k as I have to haul it back myself and it's just naturally a bit cheaper to get on location vs them having to move it themselves


[26-Oct-24 08:30 PM] zipatsu#0000

There's no secrets in my operation, guess the only secret is that despite what some players in the global chat think I don't actually have a proper well thought out plan going.  Am mostly just winging it as I continue on the road to supplying all the H2O üòÑ

[26-Oct-24 08:41 PM] zipatsu#0000
Can only speak for myself but I thoroughly enjoy the H2O extraction business, it's mostly just sending ships back and forth constantly and then recently looking into developing and managing new planets for myself and a few others as I slowly run out of viable liquid H2O sources but it's fun being able to supply one resource to everyone that needs it

Though maybe I can drop it to 40/u or something like that

[26-Oct-24 08:46 PM] zipatsu#0000
The problem there is that shipping takes between 8 hours to 1 day and some hours depending on the planet so it was getting bought up during the resupply time


[26-Oct-24 08:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
I sell in portions... Lets say I have 1000 EXOs... I post 200 EXO... it sells I post another 200 and keep going


[26-Oct-24 08:47 PM] zipatsu#0000
That's part of the reason why I just stopped listing H2O for a while, much less likely that someone who's not Allocator rich is going to throw 45m at one resource all at once üòÑ


[26-Oct-24 08:50 PM] zipatsu#0000
I listed it in batches of 100k before but then someone bought ~350k H2O over a short time period, I think that person actually ended up using it for a project though as I haven't seen them in the order book but that did cut very deep into the stock I had built up lol


[26-Oct-24 09:05 PM] marat_sh#0000
Hmm ü§î I see... Well it's still a sale... you made money eather way... But for helping people with cheap items ADI internal offer is great to keep items in ANT

I almost always sell out when list items for internal offer


[26-Oct-24 09:24 PM] zipatsu#0000

The only other buy order left up now is from a free player whose listing I've filled twice already but I stopped when I noticed they were just selling it back into my buy order which I don't fully understand the logic of as their only base in on Harmonia and the cheapest listing for H2O currently is my listing so eventually that AIC will come right back to me with interest ü§∑

I don't think they even had carriers when I played... dating how long ago it was!

Maybe worth checking out again


[31-Oct-24 07:08 AM] akyantor#0000
I did quite enjoy it as a somewhat chill game to play

Got aome beef with a few ‚Äúpirats‚Äù and left bubble for half a year

i was very involved in the background simulation.
i had a few pet projets i helped grow.

then a player faction got inserted into the homesystem of one of my factions. that was quite the bummer. haven't played since.

i also dread the engineering grind.

How do I do an auction if I am not sure of the price of the good


[03-Nov-24 07:59 AM] zipatsu#0000
It's not really a price bidding auction, it's more of a ''I have X good(s) that I would like to sell for Y price and then others can "bid" on how much of it they would like to buy" type of thing. ‚úåÔ∏è


[03-Nov-24 08:08 AM] agm114#0000
More for buying 
lets say I want to buy x good but am not to picky on price


[03-Nov-24 08:10 AM] marat_sh#0000
So you do ‚Äò/order‚Äô in order channel


[03-Nov-24 08:11 AM] agm114#0000
can I just do any in the price field?


[03-Nov-24 08:12 AM] marat_sh#0000
You can ask people here for specific items but in general you can ether search in the order channel if some one already ordered it or post it at BID price


[03-Nov-24 08:12 AM] marat_sh#0000
There is a table with internal prices somewhere but I am not sure if it‚Äôs updated


[03-Nov-24 08:58 AM] archielvahr#0000
What I usually do is search for other auctions of the same thing and match that price.


[03-Nov-24 08:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
But you can sell at whatever price works for you. I just match the previous auctions cause I am too lazy to figure out my own prices üòÇ


[03-Nov-24 09:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
I do the same when ordering. If it‚Äôs a uncommon good I‚Äôll just mention that any price is okay, in case I‚Äôm way off with my order


[03-Nov-24 09:11 AM] marat_sh#0000
I am also curios on what you produce üòÖ  if it's not a secret

An example view I used to decide what shipping to do next, summarises days of supplies remaining (both upkeep + production), repair status, capacity of goods ready for pickup by LCB & WCB, and value of goods to be sold. *I've set it up to allow me to see the resupply detail for more than one planet at once, which is sometimes useful for multiple stops.*

[08-Nov-24 09:35 AM] akyantor#0000
I've another sheet that summarises what goods I have available to sell at ANT, with reductions for any stock that I need to retain for any upkeep or manually entered construction projects. *I next want to figure out how to add reductions to fabs for repairs, but not sure how to do that yet.*


[08-Nov-24 09:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm hoping to put together something similar. Especially since I have a few routes with multiple stops, I‚Äôd like to generate the XIT actions for unloading at each planet only what is needed there


[08-Nov-24 09:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
My biggest obstacle so far is figuring out the burn components. It‚Äôs easy to get the workforce consumption from FIO, but I haven‚Äôt figured out how to do the inputs for production


[08-Nov-24 09:37 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that bit I manually maintain at the moment :S


[08-Nov-24 09:38 AM] akyantor#0000
I've a feeder sheet where I manually enter production requirements for each planet, and another sheet to collate daily needs for planets I govern.


[08-Nov-24 09:38 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh... it's not that problematic to manually manage those as they don't change all the time


[08-Nov-24 09:40 AM] akyantor#0000
The upkeep goods I feed via a sheet that does come from FIO as that's readily available.


[08-Nov-24 09:40 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, I‚Äôm okay with doing that manually. I don‚Äôt switch production often, and when I do I usually switch between two states


[08-Nov-24 09:41 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think splitting my resupplies into workforce and inputs will help as well


[08-Nov-24 09:48 AM] tuffyless#0000
I kinda do manually too.
I manually calc how much input I need for a time period.

Then subtract current inventory onsite (*provided by FIO*) .

The difference is what needs hauled to site.

[08-Nov-24 09:49 AM] tuffyless#0000
Doing that for Cons, Fabs, Inputs


[08-Nov-24 09:52 AM] tuffyless#0000
If there is a query, I prolly wouldnt like it.  
Cuz it would no doubt calc based off of what production is reoccurring, like PMMG does.
But if you insert non-reoccurring things into the queue, it's not calc'd.  
Kinda sux but maybe is just me.


[08-Nov-24 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I feel the same way. My tool only does workforce consumables because my inputs are more irregular


[08-Nov-24 11:38 AM] darjaves#0000

Do loan contracts autofill if you have sufficient liquid capital?

It doesn't make much sense really either way.  With the normal HCP => C recipe you burn 3.2 tonnes of HCP and get 9 tonnes of C

OOG represents 65% of contributions so far. I will want to rope more OOG donations in, and also solicit for cash donations. I sort of expect cash donations to be popular, but I haven't seen any yet.


[14-Nov-24 12:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
probably since there is no reason to contribute cash yet

[14-Nov-24 02:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sounds good, so how I have it working is that I'll log the contribution on the sheet, then when I buy, for example, 860 LIT for 15m, I will donate those LIT, then assign the 123504.3 shares from me to you.


[14-Nov-24 02:07 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Should I produce LIT? I have 5 GF that can take some orders


[14-Nov-24 02:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
The $ -> Share rate does vary a fair bit, but generally it tends to cluster around $150 per share


[14-Nov-24 02:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess the LIT for the first two is earmarked, 500 by Melon and 860 by Roh. I think there will be more LIT to make, but there are also mats that aren't covered yet

It‚Äôs on electronica if anyone interested


[18-Nov-24 03:25 PM] mrsmith33#0000
It is too abundant, and takes a lot of space. Basically increases price of CL, because you need to haul it.


[18-Nov-24 03:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Worth 25/u if you sell it at the CX! which might be less than the shipping cost


[18-Nov-24 03:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
I was thinking to grab it on my way back from electronica

do you have a better use for that permit?

[19-Nov-24 08:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
I was thinking of doing INC on halcyon, but if HAL is spiking again maybe I can do a bit of both


[19-Nov-24 09:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
Or maybe I should just refocus on more electronics instead - doing BMF and BWS together could be fun


[19-Nov-24 09:23 AM] allocater#0000
I think BMF and BWS is oversupplied now. BWS can crash further, but BMF is at least limited by the LOG MM

But since I also make a lot of BWS, I‚Äôm happy to crash it a bit further as well üòÅ


[19-Nov-24 10:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
wait, we weren't supposed to post all our BWS and BMF on the CX? üòÑ

[19-Nov-24 10:55 AM] hernanduer#0000

[19-Nov-24 10:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
But to be completely honest I just underestimated how much BWS was out there - there was almost none listed on ANT when I started putting together the bases for it


[19-Nov-24 02:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
is there a difference between liquid and gas H?


[19-Nov-24 02:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
like you can build RIG instead of COL for H on some planets


[19-Nov-24 03:08 PM] tuffyless#0000
No dif except you'll fit more RIG's than COL's.


[19-Nov-24 03:12 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
That planet's either at 20 K or some insanely high pressure


[19-Nov-24 03:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
RIGs use less pop and have a faster cycle time too, so it's reaaaaaaaaally nice when you can get rigs


[19-Nov-24 03:25 PM] mrsmith33#0000
RIG > COL


[19-Nov-24 03:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
is there a map of resources with types?


[19-Nov-24 03:28 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I use this one: <https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch>


[19-Nov-24 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think that one is pretty solid. Prunplanner has a search too.


[19-Nov-24 03:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can filter by distances from a system if you want map-like behavior


[19-Nov-24 03:29 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Distance to ANT is what matters


[19-Nov-24 03:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
the in-game map and the OOG map also do show resources, but I think a list is the only useful way to view it


[19-Nov-24 03:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you are looking at a resource with mixed types (like here's some EXT H2O), you will have to consider doing your own math:

[19-Nov-24 03:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
Because it makes that look comparable to Poseidon or Etherwind, but if you make a 500 area base, it's like half the H2O per day

[19-Nov-24 07:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
There‚Äôs not really a consistent list. You can look at the governor helper and the second sheet has a list of the most effective upkeep materials. Maybe it‚Äôs the third sheet.

hello

With respect to entering and maintaining all my production across all my planets... how important is that? What's the net benefit/relevance of it? The idea of manually entering and maintaining those details across 37 bases is... painful. Happy to share the details of all my production if anyone really wants to know.

It is also sort of a relic of the early universe when coordinating your 3 bases was really important. And no one had more than 2 or 3 bases

And the list never included all planets, just sort of the core ones.

[21-Nov-24 09:53 PM] evov#0000
I don't use many external tools, so I kind of have to make sheets for myself to get my head around this mess. That list is just a small part of the sheet I use to manage repair timings, work out total consume/repair usage for my operation etc.   ( e.g. 141,671 DW per 90 days required for that list )

I‚Äôve been working on some of my own excel tools for similar things. I feel like prunplanner etc worked fine when I had less bases, but I want a more customizable way to keep track of everything


[21-Nov-24 09:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
When you say you don‚Äôt use many external tools - do you use any of the APIs, or is it all manual?

[21-Nov-24 10:01 PM] evov#0000
There's times when I'm envious of some of the things people do with the API's. But, the flip side of it is that it forces me to make my own tools to manage things. Which has a distinct benefit of answering the specific questions I have, and often gives me a view/perspective that is different from most people (because I'm looking at different information/ analysis).  There's good parts and bad parts to it, but that's the ride I'm on so I'll hold on tight and see how it goes.


[21-Nov-24 10:02 PM] evov#0000
- I do use prunplanner sometimes - mostly just for planning out a base. Getting the right balance of bui's / habs etc... it's just much better than the custom sheets I made for that task in the early days.


[21-Nov-24 10:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
I love it for designing bases, but I can‚Äôt get myself to upkeep recipes etc in it üòÑ


[21-Nov-24 10:05 PM] evov#0000
I'll also import the fio prices list into my sheets, and derive everything from there. And sometimes use other tools to look for planets with specific resources etc. But I think that's the extent of the external tools I use.


[21-Nov-24 10:22 PM] sidepipe#0000

Do you guys know how to set planetary materials to the market rate on PrunPlanner?


[22-Nov-24 12:28 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I'm having trouble because my Empire CX settings are for buying at offer price and selling at ask. However, for materials I produce myself, what ends up happening is that the price spread of the material gets subtracted from my profits. I know how to manually set the material to a fixed price, but I don't know how to do it to the live market price if that's even possible.

[22-Nov-24 12:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
the way I do it I just set input materials with cost to make


[22-Nov-24 12:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
on the planets where I use them


[22-Nov-24 12:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could maybe with a sheet and some F√çO data


[22-Nov-24 12:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Other wise has to be manual


[22-Nov-24 12:34 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
This only really works if you're completely vertically integrated through, and that still doesn't factor in worker input costs


[22-Nov-24 12:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think it does, it‚Äôs got degradation, workforce and input costs


[22-Nov-24 12:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah but some parts of it still help


[22-Nov-24 12:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
cost to make does take into the account the consumables and degradation


[22-Nov-24 12:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
and it changes from time to time depending on different prices


[22-Nov-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
like on this screenshot I had 1144 cost to make Not it's 1150.16


[22-Nov-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
Since price for water didn't change that's probably Settler consumables affected price


[22-Nov-24 12:53 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Yes, but I'm referring to the fact that you have to take the dynamically calculated value and input it as a fixed one on the next step of your supply chain


[22-Nov-24 12:55 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I just set most of the prices to match my internal price

[22-Nov-24 12:59 PM] marat_sh#0000
I don't think there is a dynamic setting in Prunplanner. You will have to use API and make your own sheet


[22-Nov-24 01:00 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I just requested it as a feature


[22-Nov-24 01:01 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Because PrunPlanner gets live FIO data, I'd imagine it's reasonable to allow for specific materials to pick from a different column


[22-Nov-24 01:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yeah, it's just an additional feature. But when it was designed I assume it was to create a base in the vacuum of CX prices

Question regarding the Auctions/Orders system  ( which looks very cool btw )

Wondering what the basic protocol / acceptable standards are for using it. 

Is there a limit on how much/how often it gets used?
Is there a baseline assumption on who draws the cont's up at the end of the auction? Typically the person posting the auction/order or typically the person/people filling the auction/order?

Relevance for the question - this is my consume/repairs shopping list for the week and don't really want to flood or overwhelm the system. Typically I'd post these on the CX as bid's, spread out across the CX's as needed. But if people have bulk stock they're looking to unload, I'm happy to keep the cash/trade as local as possible.

[22-Nov-24 08:05 PM] zipatsu#0000
I can only speak from my own experience but generally for auctions I draw up the contracts myself while for orders I get them sent to me (unless the player's running on Basic of course)

For the auctions it's just whenever you have something you want to offload you can list it, for the orders I don't think there's really a usage limit to it but more of a limit of how much someone has on hand / wants to supply so it regulates itself in that regard. 

Other than that, I don't think it's a set rule but personally I do try to have some stuff to offer up myself as well every now and then so that there's some give & take going on rather than it just being me asking for yet another few thousand discounted Afabs for my H2O empire without providing anything for others in return ‚úåÔ∏è


[22-Nov-24 08:07 PM] marat_sh#0000
Auction if you want to give something and orders if you need something (people will try to fill orders if they can)


[22-Nov-24 08:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
I prefer auction instead of orders. If it's a ship upgrade or base building, I use orders


[22-Nov-24 08:09 PM] marat_sh#0000
everyone set their own price that they think is fair (or use search in the channel to see prev price on auction for that item üòÖ )


[22-Nov-24 08:18 PM] evov#0000
The prices I've got in that list are about what I think I'll be able to get them filled for on the CX. Anything that goes unfilled just gets added onto next week's list. I aim to keep at least 100 days worth of consumes/repairs. So it's rare that any of these items are urgent.

But if people broadly view the system as an internal market where it's favors being exchanged rather than just materials/currency, I'd rather keep clear of it and avoid any potential drama.


[22-Nov-24 08:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
i doubt there would be any drama if you're buying at near CX prices üòÑ


[22-Nov-24 08:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
I had a same opinion on that when I joined... Had hard time to see what price fair and what is not... Sometimes it felt like screwing someone over üòÖ But then I just went along with it and posted auctions regularly (PE and PSMs) every 3rd day


[22-Nov-24 08:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
ordering at BID is always fair in my opinion


[22-Nov-24 08:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
for example, I often auction FIM internally at about 1.5k/u


[22-Nov-24 08:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
so I wouldn't feel taken advantage of if you posted an order at 2k/u üòÑ


[22-Nov-24 08:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
plus it's all voluntary, no one needs to fill any orders at prices they can't match


[22-Nov-24 08:22 PM] marat_sh#0000
^ you don't have to use them


[22-Nov-24 08:22 PM] sidepipe#0000

[22-Nov-24 08:23 PM] evov#0000
I keep a track of my CX activity. So it's handy to be able to look back and see what the average price is that I've ACTUALLY paid for goods over time. So I'll typically look at that, and what the prices are at now, before deciding on what I'm willing to pay for goods each week.   Fim for example ->

[22-Nov-24 08:25 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
This is my benchmark too


[22-Nov-24 08:25 PM] evov#0000
So if I'm typically spending 2k per fim to MrRandom FoodProcessor (usually in HRT) - I'd gladly give 2k/ fim to Mr Local Antare's Chad.

But I do understand if people view these sorts of markets as more than just an exchange of goods/currency .... so wanted to get a feel for the "cultural" norms before I start dropping 20mil worth of orders in here every week haha


[22-Nov-24 08:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
I see orders like (damn I need this item but CX price stings) and not like a grocery shop you go every week üòÖ But that's just me... That's why I prefer auctions when people willingly give items


[22-Nov-24 08:27 PM] evov#0000
INS - a different example - typically I've paid a lot less, but the prices on the CX have gone up a lot lately, so I'd expect to pay around 135 instead of a historical 127.   And I'm sure there's examples where it's moved in the other direction as well.

I‚Äôm producing INS now


[22-Nov-24 08:44 PM] evov#0000
Probably. Like I said, I'm happy to keep doing things the way I've been doing. I'm dropping 20-40mil into the CX each week, happy for that to be more focused here if people feel like it's a net benefit. If not, totally fine. The order/auction system here seems like a pretty low friction way of handling large orders, but even the smallest amount of drama drives that friction through the roof haha.
project 6115 is the only project I see.


[22-Nov-24 08:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
Oh, gotcha - I mean the `/project` command for the discord bot üòÑ


[22-Nov-24 08:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
basically lets you batch a bunch of individual orders into one big post - and lets people suggest different prices


[22-Nov-24 08:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
How you use the internal market is really up to you - if you're buying roughly near CX bid prices, I doubt there would ever be any drama even if you never sold a single thing internally

Personally I think the auctions should be a gave-n-take.  If you buy things at a discount, then should sell other things at a discount.  Different sellers, different buyers, different mats, etc will be involved ... so it all gets divy'd up.
Services excluded, such as Archy w/ Ship-Building aggregations, the OOG bank admin, etc.


[22-Nov-24 09:10 PM] tuffyless#0000
And while Im thinking & typing  -  I'd suggest that anything below the CX Ask is fair for posting (*whether current or average*).  Times/Prices change and IMO just because an auction happened 2 months ago at "Price A" doesnt mean that that's the cap today.


[22-Nov-24 09:11 PM] tuffyless#0000
I mean ... postings at higher than CX wouldnt make sense eh.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è   So anything below it may well get the attention.

[23-Nov-24 05:44 AM] akyantor#0000
It‚Äôs a totally voluntary system, so super chill from my perspective. I put some stuff on the system and some stuff on the CX.

I like to participate as I normally get some things a little cheaper, and so like to offer some of my own stuff a little cheaper. But no one‚Äôs keeping track of anything‚Ä¶ so up to an individual on how they want to use it‚Ä¶ as someone said if you don‚Äôt like the price of an auction or order just scroll on by. üòâ

I was poking at the prosperous bot a little today and thought I'd share a few interesting numbers from the database.

So far there have been:
* 1645 Auctions
* 2042 Orders
* 81 Projects
* 562 project items

And that's all been entirely in this discord server. This has been by far my most widely used personal project, so thanks everyone for really embracing it üôÇ

The top 10 users of the auction feature have done between 90-160 auctions each. The top 10 orders users have done 70-280 orders each.

The top user of projects has started almost half of all projects, and has 4x as many as the next highest user.

[26-Nov-24 05:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
Though, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs just because orders show up in your CONTS, while you have to draft a bunch for auctions


[26-Nov-24 06:02 PM] exeler#0000
That's probably a factor. I think running auctions also only applies for certain play styles. 

Like basically my entire company is based around making mass quantities of widely consumed goods. So basically all my income comes from auctions. 

If you're going for higher tier goods though, it makes less and less sense to do the auctions, but more and more sense to do orders for the large quantities of things you need. 

Orders are also useful for grabbing small quantities of things that might be harder to find.


[26-Nov-24 06:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000

That's an interesting question I think I can dig up an answer for. I should be able to compare the volume of goods that go through both in terms of item count and monetary value.

I find the order/auction system interesting. It's a nice discord tool, but the way people interact with it seems a bit surprising to me.

For example - there's a few items I've offered to buy... and a short time after making those offers, people auctioning the same items, for less than I was already willing to pay.

I would gladly buy all your HMS at your price - but thought it would be more polite to just order the amount I was originally chasing üôÇ


[27-Nov-24 10:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
no need to worry about being polite, that's why we have the bot üòÑ


[27-Nov-24 10:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
it solves the problem of allocating things fairly quite nicely, imo


[27-Nov-24 10:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
and every once in a while, no one else bids and you end up with 900k PE. I still have 220k of that left


[27-Nov-24 10:26 PM] evov#0000
I think I bought 1.8mil of PE off all the CX's last week. I'll use it up eventually if I ever get around to shipping it back to the mother land of the ANT cx warehouse


[27-Nov-24 10:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
This is probably just because the auction system makes it a lot easier not to pay attention to prices, heh

So I got the galaxy tier for test server access, and now I've got this sytem naming thing burning a hole in my pocket.. First thoughts were LS-231 as "Gateway", maybe "Midway", or RC-040 as "Antares Minor" but I'm open to suggestions. It could be funny to continue the Antares colonization, but also LS-231 is going to be higher traffic

For me sometimes I come late to an order and it's already fulfilled. But the order reminds me I have a ton of an item sitting at the CX, so I'll run an auction to see if anyone else also wanted some. 

For me at least, the auctions are convenient because 99% of the time everything gets sold and I can send out the contracts all at once.

The auction system also came about initially when we were a little more specialized. I know at the time I was one of the only HE producers, so I used the auctions a fair bit just to make sure everyone had some. 

Now I use them as a way to unload 1200 LHP at the same time without killing the CX prices üòÖ

[05-Dec-24 02:53 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
I think there's several use cases for it. 
1) Transferring Risk : if you have an incompletely vertically integrated production chain, you can pay a small upfront fee to a futures seller who would act as an insurance against undue price increases in your input resources, thus guaranteeing a fixed profit margin.
2) Increase liquidity: for new players, the ability to sell future production is invaluable in spurring further growth by providing cash up front, and serves as an alternative/compliment to starter loans
3) Passive income: for large established players, futures allow them to make money from insuring smaller players when the only current alternative are loan interest and spread trading


[05-Dec-24 02:54 PM] roche3950#0000
well 1 is the fundamental use case of a future
2 is clever

If anyone else has comments/critiques of this, I'd love to hear it


[05-Dec-24 03:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I was buying big batches of LCBs with payments up front from Insula. like 4m at a time, 30d or maybe more. Worked well til they disappeared


[05-Dec-24 03:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
if it's a non-prepaid agreement at a fixed price, I'd be happy to do those all day long


[05-Dec-24 03:20 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Well, it is semi-prepaid, as you pay an upfront fee to the seller independent of the price of the goods


[05-Dec-24 03:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
I actually tried pricing options on different commodities like RAT and FIM with black scholes as practice for a certification exam a while back. Mathematically, nothing's stopping you - I was looking at 1 day returns and most commodities are overdispersed compared to a lognormal distribution, but that's just like real life


[05-Dec-24 03:23 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
What was your method for calculating IV?


[05-Dec-24 03:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
IV = implied volatility?


[05-Dec-24 03:25 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Yeah


[05-Dec-24 03:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
let me find my code somewhere


[05-Dec-24 03:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
but I think it was just the standard deviation of all the lognormal returns


[05-Dec-24 03:28 PM] roche3950#0000

One year is an eternity in this game though


[05-Dec-24 03:30 PM] roche3950#0000
so just take the 1d return and multiply by in this case sqrt(365)


[05-Dec-24 03:31 PM] shinonomesciences#0000
Oh, I thought you were referring to averaging other data into it


[05-Dec-24 03:31 PM] roche3950#0000

[05-Dec-24 03:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
and so I estimated sigma by taking ln(close at t / close at t-1) from FIO data and using the sample standard deviation of that


[05-Dec-24 03:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
and then priced 7-day options by doing this whole thing with t=7'

With the way contracts work in-game, there's not a good mechanism to implement the American version


[05-Dec-24 03:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
anyway, using FIM as an example, you can see the data fits a lognormal distribution fairly well, but with fat tails

[05-Dec-24 03:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
i think the biggest practical obstacles are that there's no real risk-free interest rate in the game, and that it would be way too easy to manipulate the market


[05-Dec-24 03:45 PM] roche3950#0000
Just have the major lenders submit something like LIBOR

[05-Dec-24 04:00 PM] roche3950#0000
to most fairly price those options you‚Äôd effectively have to price a call or a put as a spread where the other strike is the price band


[05-Dec-24 04:02 PM] roche3950#0000
A call on DW with K=70 should be priced as a call spread with Klower = 70 and Kupper = 121(iirc?)


[05-Dec-24 04:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
that would probably be the fairest approach. but since you're going through all the trouble of writing the options anyway, you could just pocket the difference üòâ

i think it'd be interesting to write a limited amount of options as a trial to a small group. basically sell up to a set amount of a few different strikes over a 1-2 week period and see how it goes

I‚Äôd be willing to assist in the experiment in some capacity

I think another concern though is that every market participant is pretty influential

I think it's a mix, and it varies based on the commodity. It does sort of tend towards a balance. But there are some interesting points


[09-Dec-24 10:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
Extraction heavy builds use a lot of shipping. In early universe I think EXTs were easy to run and had a lowpayout per base. I think that's rising lately. Because people are looking more towards profit per permit rather than ROI


[09-Dec-24 10:18 AM] archielvahr#0000

Only have 11 bases myself and it's a bit easier when 90% of it is just resource extraction but I stock all of them up with 60 days worth of supplies so that I only really need to worry about collecting the finished product & repairs, am also a big fan of adding 2 STO and all the warehouse space I can buy to each base to reduce the need for a strict shipping schedule  ‚úåÔ∏è


[13-Dec-24 05:31 PM] marat_sh#0000
Do you guys do a HUB planet that has close bases instead of supplying everything from cx?


[13-Dec-24 05:34 PM] zipatsu#0000
I supply it from the CX, a hub planet would be great but my quest for all the H2O leaves me with not enough permit freedom to use on things like that üòÖ

I've been wondering about this..


[14-Dec-24 12:36 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
Ohhh


[14-Dec-24 01:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Hey @everyone ! A few things:

## Retiring the old price list:

I'm planning to retire the old OOG price list (and the planet list). Both of these tools were super valuable at the start of the universe when each person only had a planet or three. Back then it took a lot of coordination to make sure specific things were being made at all. 

Unfortunately:
* The sheer number of developed planets means that format doesn't make sense
* Prices are very out of date
* It's a hassle I don't want to subject new people to filling out
* It's just hard to keep it accurate and up to date with everyone's production changes. (and when people stop playing)
* Our excellent /order and /auction system overrides it.

To discuss, see the thread below.

## Welcome new members!

We have a handful of new members who joined recently! Our new members have been amazing getting up to speed with the game and building their production up. 

Please keep an eye out for their production /orders in #orders and if you have extra fabs, fill the orders, oldest first. Or make /auctions if you have fabs you want to get rid of. I think in general there is a shortage of bfabs, lfabs, and rfabs, but just in case! 

In the past 2 months we added 6 new players: @agm114 , @superbadsounds ,  @bookliko, @tyrandia, @roche3950, and @cptboby ! Plus @evov !

## Gateways!

The first pair of ADI Gateway Co-op gates has 71% of the shares allocated. Another gateway will be added soon. We still need a bunch of afabs, RSH, and TSH. I'm personally looking for PSH and HSE to build TRS. If you want to contribute cash or materials to the gateways, let me know. You can be paid for your contributions either in gateway shares OR cash.

Has anyone ever held a race in game? I'm thinking of a few ways to make it interesting, but it would essentially be a series of shipping contracts. Podium finishers split a prize pool of IDC or something.


[18-Dec-24 11:13 AM] superbadsounds#0000
Could be a cool way to promote some of the more niche parts


[18-Dec-24 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
I like the idea!


[18-Dec-24 11:52 AM] superbadsounds#0000
I can work up something a bit more formal to share on UFO, but my hope for a first race would be a minimum of 10 competitors buying in at 100k each. Winner gets 500k, 2nd gets 150k, and 3rd walks away with 100k, having essentially only spent money on fuel and the degradation of their ship.
With enough interest, there's the possibility I could put together a seasonal league with a championship series.


[18-Dec-24 11:54 AM] superbadsounds#0000
I think the game allows for a variety of race formats, but the key will be finding out what people actually enjoy and find competetive.

So, 400 HSE valued at 4.6M AIC would be just under a 1% share in the gateway?


[18-Dec-24 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
78.7 shares each, 31480 total. so about 0.8% of the project (or 1.6% of one gateway)


[18-Dec-24 02:31 PM] draconisdomini#0000
Works for me


[18-Dec-24 02:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
So those HSE will go into TRS that I'm making on Nike. So in this case I will take them now and record your contribution as a share transfer

Roh is quite the shareholder despite his derailing comments


[18-Dec-24 04:47 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Are any of the parts made in a PPF?


[18-Dec-24 04:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nope not really anything in a PPF... I think nothing actually.  Maybe something tiny has plastic bits, but I cna't think of it


[18-Dec-24 04:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
yeah I actually am checking in with Roh, because he listed a lot of LIT and he isn't on the leader board, I don't think he has made ANY of it yet


[18-Dec-24 04:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I said PPF I meant UPF I think


[18-Dec-24 04:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh, nope, no UPF stuff. It's all in APFs and AAFs instead


[18-Dec-24 04:55 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Day in the life of a real halcyon miner. Wake up and eat my ration cube. Quick drink of caffeinated infusion. 14 hours in the salt mine. My friend breaks his arm at work, but the infirmary only has office supplies so they write him a doctor's note

I always figured the rations would either be combat-ration style preportioned packages, or slightly less depressing nutraloaves.


[20-Dec-24 07:17 PM] roche3950#0000
leaning towards the first the more I think about it, the food mixes may imply that
BEA-NUT-GRN -> pre-boiled, packaged beans, a piece of bread, and a package of nuts
edit: maybe a flour tortilla is involved??
~~ALG-MUS-MAI -> Seaweed-mushroom ‚Äúpatty‚Äù (mystery fish??) and cornbread~~ scratch that one that‚Äôs not a valid combination

Which worlds are people generally finding in short supply these days? I've heard/intuited chemical and electronics worlds, but I'm curious what others think

I tried the HYF route for a while but I didn't find it cost effective with the base upkeep and nearly constantly buying the water and nutrient solution that goes into them.  HYF farms drink like elephants, where as regular Agri planets are sippers.  By and large, I usually find the type of planet I'm looking for at the time, are always in short supply.  lol.


[28-Dec-24 09:22 AM] roche3950#0000
Hm, yeah. The big limiting factor for fertile worlds is plainly their rarity. I count 25 in the whole game.


[28-Dec-24 09:22 AM] katinga#0000
Goldilocks planets.  Yes


[28-Dec-24 09:23 AM] roche3950#0000
A handful of those are dedicated to other things bcause of other resources (Katoa, Deimos, Phobos, Montem), their distance (Saladin, Talosia), or their poor fertility (Electronica, Etherwind) ...


[28-Dec-24 09:24 AM] roche3950#0000
I've been staring down an attempt to develop one of the last fertile planets too


[28-Dec-24 09:25 AM] roche3950#0000

[28-Dec-24 09:25 AM] katinga#0000
Did you have one in mind?


[28-Dec-24 09:26 AM] roche3950#0000
The last two that have gone unnamed and are thus practically untouched are HM-910c and QF-930b.


[28-Dec-24 09:27 AM] roche3950#0000
They have some basic infrastructure, HM- has a COG facility. Neither planet's water resources are particularly rich, QF- probably requires import of water even despite the ability to drill (drink? lol, brain) locally.

Is here anyone know, when a ship jump into other system.
The ship will appear from where? Close to the star(sun)?


[02-Jan-25 12:31 AM] martin1194#0000
Cuz I would like to design a ship for my own to jump faster, and I need to consider STL engine.


[02-Jan-25 08:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
It appears close to the destination planet. That's why it's faster to jump out of system sometimes rather than to fly from planet "a" to "h" with STL flight


[02-Jan-25 11:18 AM] roche3950#0000
I actually did not know this and this is huge.
Thanks.


[02-Jan-25 11:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah you can jump out of system and jump back in and sometimes it's faster. usually planet a through d or a through e  are not too bad

But the last gas giant or two can be quite far out, it depends totally on the system though.

If I asked someone here to be a perennial supplier of SARs, is this a reasonable request to begin with, and if so at what price does it become a reasonable request?


[02-Jan-25 10:49 PM] evov#0000
Depends, what do you need them for?


[02-Jan-25 10:57 PM] evov#0000
The current buy orders up at 31k /unit seem pretty reasonable as far as pricing goes, what sort of volume are you looking at?


[03-Jan-25 05:36 AM] allocater#0000

and yes one may say MED are the lower hanging fruit but I‚Äôm not sure about the burn rate relative to the production rate, seems extremely easy to flood the market


[03-Jan-25 06:10 AM] roche3950#0000
2,924 units traded on AI1 in the last 7 days, and iirc a CHP base focused on MEDs will make 425 a day


[03-Jan-25 06:13 AM] roche3950#0000
plus with ADRs going into ship production or into the MM woodchipper, they can either support that ship supply or be a constant source of income which will allow me to further expand


[03-Jan-25 07:46 AM] martin1194#0000

[04-Jan-25 08:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Put a bigger FTL fuel tank on it. Right now 100% is only 300 fuel. If you have bigger tanks, you can burn more fuel


[04-Jan-25 08:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lightweight Hull plates will be faster than basic hull plates because they are lighter (but only for the STL portions of the flight)


[04-Jan-25 08:21 PM] martin1194#0000
In right-side window, you can see the highest speed should be 156parsec per hour.


[04-Jan-25 08:22 PM] martin1194#0000
But in the left-side window, it takes 4hrs to fly 12parsec :smiledog:

cheap base with quick return


[05-Jan-25 06:56 AM] evov#0000
Yea, I think that's a good thing. To be clear - something like 95% of all MEA's produced go towards IDC money farms. So while the profitability per permit of IDC's is significantly higher than that of MEA producers, I don't really see a good reason to put a thumb on the scale in either direction.


[05-Jan-25 07:06 AM] evov#0000
I'll start feeding FIM onto the ANT cx if it breaks 2800. And MEA at 6000. If it doesn't reach those levels, I feel like just let the food producers enjoy their time in the sun.  (My personal stockpile is at about 20k fim and 10k mea at the moment, so it should be enough to buy time for things to stabilize if needed )

I pull in prices from fio into a sheet, and then process it from there.

Are these auto update?


[06-Jan-25 02:31 AM] martin1194#0000
Or, u need to manual copy and paste?


[06-Jan-25 02:38 AM] evov#0000
Up to date whenever I refresh the fio prices page, yeah.

That makes no sense to me; AFR only goes into FIR which requires 1:2 EES, and there's nowhere near enough EES in the universe to match that, nor enough demand for the HPR/HYR/PFG that would result.  But maybe they just want to pile it up into a 10kt mound and make sandcastles out of it ü§∑

To be fair, it seems like there‚Äôs few things late-game that move fast enough to sell consistently


[09-Jan-25 03:55 PM] evov#0000
I'm always a bit skeptical of these total wealth graphs that show massive spikes up and down. When I see massive spikes, I'm like... woah! Why don't you do more of that thing you just did there. And people will be "I didn't do anything there, no idea why line went up".

My broad view is that data/information/graphs etc are only relevant if they have the potential to influence future choices.


[09-Jan-25 03:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
A lot of the spikes are the change in RPRUN where they started counting ships and hq levels


[09-Jan-25 04:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
My big spike is my cut from the OOG bank bases - we just ran out of customers üòÅ


[09-Jan-25 04:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
And sure, the total equity isn‚Äôt really useful as a decision-making tool. The only time it‚Äôs helped me make a decision was when it stopped going up for a long time. But it‚Äôs a fun measure of progress in the game about accumulating wealth  üòÑ

I have no cash anymore; spent everything on HQ's.  It's obvious where the HQ + Ships come into play.
Everything is slowly being geared to produce more-n-more afabs;
the excess of anything is accumulated onto the CX because the winds of change all the time;
then all overstock for there is discounted at OOG's Auction & Order House!

oh ofc if ur finding stable buyer then I'm in


[10-Jan-25 02:23 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
bid price is reasonable


[10-Jan-25 02:24 AM] martin1194#0000
My HQ is in HRT. Was suppose to do food and args.


[10-Jan-25 02:24 AM] martin1194#0000
But :/     I don't know what happened after that. Ton of CHEM and Construct :Panda_Derp_Drinking_Animated:


[10-Jan-25 02:25 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
Several days ago before I COLIQ to ANT space, I'm in HRT too. I suggest u check out FIM


[10-Jan-25 02:25 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I believe its profitable and have big market space


[10-Jan-25 02:26 AM] martin1194#0000
FIM needs RAT.


[10-Jan-25 02:26 AM] max.kalina#0000
I have HQ in HRT too, but most of my bases are in ANT space now. On Prom I have agri base and on Avalon food production


[10-Jan-25 02:26 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah better start with RAT anyway


[10-Jan-25 02:27 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I'm interested in metals and chemicals so moved here


[10-Jan-25 02:27 AM] martin1194#0000
I am thinking now


[10-Jan-25 02:27 AM] martin1194#0000
Isn't Chem related to no faction :Panda_Derp_Drinking_Animated: ?


[10-Jan-25 02:28 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah thats true


[10-Jan-25 02:31 AM] martin1194#0000
How ANT is good for chemicals? Cogc?


[10-Jan-25 02:32 AM] max.kalina#0000
Bober and Griffonstone are Chem planets


[10-Jan-25 02:33 AM] max.kalina#0000
Griffonstone is situated far, Bober needs TSH


[10-Jan-25 02:33 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I didnt think that much. Just think chem and metal should be on same tree branch


[10-Jan-25 02:33 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so no furthur plan  atm, just AL FE STL etc.


[10-Jan-25 02:34 AM] martin1194#0000

[10-Jan-25 02:36 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
just different direction. HRT is really a great base though


[10-Jan-25 08:52 AM] hernanduer#0000
639d, 759d, ki-840c, electronica, elon


[10-Jan-25 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000
I'd do all of those before bober to avoid tsh


[10-Jan-25 08:53 AM] hernanduer#0000

[10-Jan-25 10:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah at the moment the governor role is our proxy for being a "moderator"  on the discord server. That distributes some of the common administrative tasks like role setting and such. It's a holdover from early universe when there were fewer planets and also the old politics system (before parliaments). But it's worked fine so we haven't changed it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[16-Jan-25 07:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
AL is in high demand lately, so that'll be profitable for you


[16-Jan-25 07:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
Lots of really good prices for new players. DW is really profitable now, and if if you go further down the food processing chain, FIM and MEA are likely to stay really profitable.


[16-Jan-25 07:05 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah that's true. I've deeply studied FIM before I COLIQ to ANT space.


[16-Jan-25 07:05 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
and AL price just strikes up to 850 per unit, my #1 Happy News this morning haha


[16-Jan-25 07:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think we're still a few months out on the gateway stuff. There's probably not a lot of good gateway items at the immediate moment for new players to get into.. except that I think the gateway projects indirectly drive up the prices of the base goods like C, AL, RAT, and DW


[16-Jan-25 07:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you run into price spikes on your key production materials like Carbon, just ask in corp


[16-Jan-25 07:06 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I'm planning to develop my Deimos AL base to full and start a Carbon production center to support my metal industry


[16-Jan-25 07:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
we often hold stockpiles to insulate against price shocks


[16-Jan-25 07:07 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
oh wow that's sweet

what about FE/STL, is that in hot mode ?


[16-Jan-25 07:07 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I'm planning to have a base on Vulcan


[16-Jan-25 07:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
FE and STL don't get a ton of use cause they are heavy and annoying to move, and for construction fabs, AL is better


[16-Jan-25 07:08 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok I get it


[16-Jan-25 07:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
I use FE in MHL and alloys, and a bit of STL for Rfabs


[16-Jan-25 07:08 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
then I'll search for another AL planet and start a exactly same base


[16-Jan-25 07:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that works, or you can eventually mix in ASMs into Deimos


[16-Jan-25 07:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
ASMs eat up your SME output pretty quickly


[16-Jan-25 07:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
And the alloy metals tend to go into ship components and that sort of thing


[16-Jan-25 07:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
All depends what you plan to do with the AL (or other SME outputs)

[16-Jan-25 07:10 PM] archielvahr#0000

[16-Jan-25 07:10 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000

[16-Jan-25 07:10 PM] archielvahr#0000

so I need to build ship components my self with alloys ?


[16-Jan-25 07:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can sell them to someone in the corp with a SKF, melon or Bookliko or TimurOm or... someone I am forgetting


[16-Jan-25 07:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
basically it's almost impossible to keep a SKF running on your own, it just eats too many metals


[16-Jan-25 07:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you go down that route, you will want to check in with everyone on what to make. I think LCBs are pretty reliable, they are 200 AST each


[16-Jan-25 07:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
it's kinda easy to end up with excess alloys of one type and have trouble selling them


[16-Jan-25 07:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
because it's a balance thing


[16-Jan-25 07:19 PM] altf4forbetterlife#0000

if you hold a lot of goods and then on the CX the value of the good changes, the entire company value changes

It also tracks building depreciation. But it‚Äôs almost certainly the market price of goods changing like allocater said.

Was making my own excel for better game experience . :3


[20-Jan-25 11:07 AM] martin1194#0000
Then, I try to don't miss notification about election. ü§£ 
Was ignored all not about contracts/arrived


[20-Jan-25 11:29 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ohh election time Yeah


[20-Jan-25 11:31 AM] archielvahr#0000
It is a lot of work to retrieve üò≠

[20-Jan-25 11:31 AM] archielvahr#0000
If you pull a user's data via country code, and look at the offices, you can find the StartEpoch and endEpoch


[20-Jan-25 11:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
So what I used to do is pull each planet, find the username of the governor, then pull the governor by companycode


[20-Jan-25 11:33 AM] archielvahr#0000
then list their office history, (which is very long)


[20-Jan-25 11:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
then pull the largest endEpoch


[20-Jan-25 11:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
Which you can convert to an actual date with some work


[20-Jan-25 11:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
But this hasn't worked well since the politics update, due to the changes in offices


[20-Jan-25 11:35 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think maybe if you move from rest.ffnar.net to https://api.fnar.net/index.html (which is the newer one), you might get good office data


[20-Jan-25 11:36 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's really hard to do the multidimensional stuff in a sheet. So I moved a lot of my stuff into google apps script


[20-Jan-25 11:38 AM] archielvahr#0000
This is what I use, but I don't think it works great. Maybe it can be a starting point for you

[20-Jan-25 11:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
honestly I think this needs to be converted to a webapp or something, and it's just too complex to work well in google sheets


[20-Jan-25 01:02 PM] martin1194#0000
-0-!!  Will check what request is good for get data related to election.


[20-Jan-25 01:03 PM] martin1194#0000
u use this to update ur google excel?


[20-Jan-25 01:04 PM] martin1194#0000
Hell yeah. Google sheets can not do well if ton of request. 
But it also the time if need to research how to make a website. ;_;


[20-Jan-25 01:05 PM] martin1194#0000
Was wanna make C++ program for drag data.
But sucked in CURL installation on my computer. :/


[20-Jan-25 01:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah the google sheet just stops working if there are too many ImportJSON or ImportData requests.


[20-Jan-25 01:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also I'm not sure if the Members of Parliament show up in the API, or only the governors


[20-Jan-25 01:09 PM] martin1194#0000
U can press try it out on the website


[20-Jan-25 01:10 PM] martin1194#0000

Hugo. New framework.


[20-Jan-25 01:19 PM] archielvahr#0000

What is it?


[20-Jan-25 01:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ahh it's when I started to write something to do message lookups, but I didnt' get very far so it doens't do anything


[20-Jan-25 01:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
but I left it on there to make people wonder üòÑ


[20-Jan-25 01:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
The idea was: If someone new applies, you could put in their company code, and it would show their FIO info, plus all their APEX Chat and UFO chat. To make it easier to screen new applicants


[20-Jan-25 01:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also I have spies in most of the private corp discords, which is helpful sometimes


[20-Jan-25 01:24 PM] martin1194#0000
Oh, so just a tool to help guide new members.


[20-Jan-25 01:26 PM] martin1194#0000
It is hard to do. I guess there are no API from Discord. Can not get UFO chat.


[20-Jan-25 01:26 PM] martin1194#0000
But the only way is, u add a bot in the UFO server.


[20-Jan-25 01:30 PM] archielvahr#0000
There is an API to retrieve messages without a bot

Sorts for Local Market?
And Sorts for election?
What else? :Panda_Derp_Drinking_Animated:


[20-Jan-25 01:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think 
* Reminders for elections
* Reminders for filling COGC
* Reminders to vote for COGC
* Maybe some sort of POPI tracking..? 

I don't really use local markets anymore


[20-Jan-25 01:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh and the things for corp administration I used to do in the sheets:
* List of Players in the corp
* List the activity ratings ( did they go inactive)
* Track some basics, how many bases they have, governor positions, etc


[20-Jan-25 01:37 PM] katinga#0000
well governorships on planets that matter at least


[20-Jan-25 01:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I'm not sure what I'd want to see out of that sort of part. Like if a planet like Harmonia has no one running, we should have a red flag so we notice that. But also just like: "Oh hey Katinga is the MP of these 3 planets" is nice to know without opening the `usr` panel for every one of the 30 people in the corp


[20-Jan-25 01:40 PM] katinga#0000
my 3 in Romulan space don't really matter in the grand scheme of things


[20-Jan-25 01:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah but it helps to know to keep track of players who go inactive. Like sometimes we have governors who kinda quit without saying anything


[20-Jan-25 01:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
And no one notices until it's kinda too late üò¨


[20-Jan-25 02:03 PM] martin1194#0000
track who is governors but inactive? :Panda_Derp_Drinking_Animated:


[20-Jan-25 02:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Haven't thought it out too much, but any extra information that helps us avoid that sort of thing


[20-Jan-25 07:42 PM] martin1194#0000

Was expecting it sometime next year üò±


[28-Jan-25 07:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
I was also expecting it to use the new metal


[28-Jan-25 08:01 AM] katinga#0000
what's the new metal's shorthand?


[28-Jan-25 08:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
RHE - Rhenium is the base metal


[28-Jan-25 08:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
then it has two alloys in an ASM, ALR and WRH


[28-Jan-25 08:48 AM] katinga#0000
It doesn't seem that I can search for it on the Map yet


[28-Jan-25 08:48 AM] katinga#0000
Is RHO the ore?


[28-Jan-25 08:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah RHO is the ore, but it shouldn't be released yet


[28-Jan-25 08:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think it's even on the test server


[28-Jan-25 08:51 AM] katinga#0000
Let me know what materials you need to make the new ship.  I'm always smelting


[28-Jan-25 09:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
Make as much WAL as you can


[28-Jan-25 09:06 AM] katinga#0000
I don't make WAL.  I mine and smelt


[28-Jan-25 09:08 AM] archielvahr#0000
It's _fancy smelting_ üòÑ


[28-Jan-25 09:09 AM] archielvahr#0000
I imagine the W and AL markets won't really be affected by the increased need for WAL


[28-Jan-25 09:17 AM] katinga#0000
I can provide the AL part of the WAL!


[28-Jan-25 07:03 PM] roche3950#0000
really out-there question but: anyone need ZIR?


[28-Jan-25 07:04 PM] roche3950#0000

[28-Jan-25 07:23 PM] roche3950#0000
Cannot close the base until it's all gone


[28-Jan-25 07:29 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôll take some


[28-Jan-25 07:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ahh that makes sense


[28-Jan-25 07:33 PM] roche3950#0000
Can I contract at KI-401b


[28-Jan-25 07:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Sure I have no storage there


[28-Jan-25 07:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So I‚Äôll have to wait for a ship or get some WAR


[28-Jan-25 07:34 PM] roche3950#0000
Government only allows 2 WAR spots


[28-Jan-25 07:34 PM] roche3950#0000
which is extremely frustrating


[28-Jan-25 07:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[29-Jan-25 11:38 AM] roche3950#0000
Remind me please: planetary infra buildings require upkeep, right? How can I view what is needed?


[29-Jan-25 11:38 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Only COGC and POPI needs supply


[29-Jan-25 11:38 AM] mrsmith33#0000

[29-Jan-25 11:46 AM] roche3950#0000
ah, I see


[29-Jan-25 11:58 AM] roche3950#0000
what is the upkeep value that I see for instance on STR for, then?


[29-Jan-25 11:58 AM] roche3950#0000
Stretchers needed for Infirmaries in this instance


[29-Jan-25 12:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
you'll want to watch for efficiencies there


[29-Jan-25 12:03 PM] hernanduer#0000
some goods in POPI are 10x more efficient than others


[29-Jan-25 12:04 PM] roche3950#0000
obligatory statement of interests: I want to try to top the charts on a lot of the medical-themed goods, but I want to plan for what I can actually sell vs. when I‚Äôm purely gonna be roleplaying, lol.


[29-Jan-25 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
unfortunately there's not really a market for any of them, and if you get paid at all it won't recoup your costs in producing the items a lot of times


[29-Jan-25 12:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
TUB is about the only one that gets significant use


[29-Jan-25 12:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
and some drone stuff might use some items?


[29-Jan-25 12:06 PM] hernanduer#0000
but there's very low need on that


[29-Jan-25 12:06 PM] roche3950#0000
ADR and SDR can be dumped into MM


[29-Jan-25 12:06 PM] roche3950#0000
again obligatory statement of it being an irrational goal/for funsies as opposed to raw efficiency


[29-Jan-25 12:07 PM] hernanduer#0000
ah yeah okay, at least you won't go bankrupt with those MMs üòÑ


[29-Jan-25 12:07 PM] hernanduer#0000

[29-Jan-25 12:08 PM] roche3950#0000
Once I can sustain with the actually tradable stuff I can branch into the RP


[29-Jan-25 12:20 PM] roche3950#0000
and not to mention the actual consumable stuff, though the numbers on those are questionable

I looked at this planet and it seems a bit too far. Why not SE-052a for example?


[31-Jan-25 09:52 AM] sidepipe#0000
I just chose it because it‚Äôs relatively close to Thalassa / SE-110 and only needs INS


[31-Jan-25 09:53 AM] mrsmith33#0000
SE-052a also needs SEA which is pretty much zero cost


[31-Jan-25 09:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
Is it much closer to ANT? I‚Äôm on mobile right now so I can‚Äôt check


[31-Jan-25 09:54 AM] sidepipe#0000
I haven‚Äôt dropped an ADM yet so I could still move if 052a makes more sense, just need some time to look at it

Nice map üòÑ


[31-Jan-25 09:55 AM] sidepipe#0000
Let me take a look at 052a this evening - if the SEA isn‚Äôt too much more expensive, it‚Äôs probably better to move it now while the investment is relatively small


[31-Jan-25 09:56 AM] mrsmith33#0000
There is also `ZV-639c` which needs INS + HSE


[31-Jan-25 09:56 AM] sidepipe#0000
I tend to lean towards more travel time for a cheaper base, but that‚Äôs only because I have slightly more ships than I need right now


[31-Jan-25 09:57 AM] sidepipe#0000
Wouldn‚Äôt HSE be pretty expensive for a base with 26 FP (or something like that?)


[31-Jan-25 09:57 AM] mrsmith33#0000
yes, if you don't produce your own


[31-Jan-25 09:58 AM] mrsmith33#0000

[31-Jan-25 10:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôll play around with those planets in prunplanner and see how base costs & travel times turn out - ideally, I‚Äôd like it to not be prohibitively expensive for non-OOGers to settle on since I think Antares really needs another FP planet


[31-Jan-25 10:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I found SE-751b a while ago and didn‚Äôt really look any further than that, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôve done a ton of research üòÑ

Only 11 slots at the moment, but you could start anywhere and grab Deimos. So if you want o keep a Prom base, that might make sense

Looking at contracts I've got I can see the name given but only before it's archived/partially completed/completed.


[07-Feb-25 03:06 PM] shokanshi#0000
The second its out of that information box that pops out on the right, it seems to just becomes ---

So this long active loan contract that is forever ticking still has its name.

Is popi cost for low tier workers actually unbalanced?  I wasn‚Äôt aware of it, but I‚Äôm not very on the pulse of governor issues


[10-Feb-25 09:00 AM] melon164#0000
If they‚Äôre going to make popi cheaper, they should make programs more expensive, imo


[10-Feb-25 09:28 AM] akyantor#0000
I wouldn't have imagined it was that much of a problem. The biggest issue seemed to be there wasn't much balance between the satisfaction offered by certain buildings or pop goods. i.e. more expensive goods often aren't worth providing in favour of cheaper ones.


[10-Feb-25 09:28 AM] akyantor#0000
At least based upon my limited experience operating planets that mostly use PIO/SET.


[10-Feb-25 09:28 AM] akyantor#0000
You generally can't go wrong with stuffing the buildings with OFF and upgrade them until you have enough statisfaction. You just ignore almost every other type of good.


[10-Feb-25 09:33 AM] roche3950#0000
who knew staplers and sticky notes were the key to joy

Is that Refined PMMG no need to load page about base to get base info?


[10-Feb-25 09:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the XIT BURN page in RPRUN loads all the bases itself


[10-Feb-25 09:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
if that's what you are experiencing...


[10-Feb-25 10:36 PM] martin1194#0000
yay. Then, I no need to make a lot of page for bases


[10-Feb-25 11:58 PM] evov#0000
r.e. pop upkeep intervals. Why not make everything 7 days to match the pop timings? It would make fractional upkeeps on smaller planets far far far easier and more reliable. With 3 day/5day/10day etc - it gets really messy with respect to what % of the 7 day window pop was supplied for.

For example, with the 10day cycles as it is, it's possible to 20-30% fill one of those buildings, have the first 2-3 days of the pop supply fall within one 7day pop window, then the next pop window gets 0% supply time.

As it is, it's a pain in the ass to efficiently supply pop on smaller planets. Moving the supply window to be longer 7 days makes this a lot worse and almost impossible to supply small pops without massive waste.


[11-Feb-25 12:03 AM] lancercaster#0000
Hmm considered getting into fuel refining but the market seems already saturated...


[11-Feb-25 12:15 AM] bookliko#0000
hmmm, I would argue it needs more producers: on ANT & HOR CX its hugging close to MM. When I started playing the price was closer to 10/u. There are some whales storing SF on CX, but clearly not interested in selling, distorting the supply/demand ratio.


[11-Feb-25 04:17 AM] shokanshi#0000
Fuel usage might go up with gateways.


[11-Feb-25 04:18 AM] shokanshi#0000
So maybe get in early

Molp has made clear (https://com.prosperousuniverse.com/t/pro-license-trading-permitted/6888/3) that this is not permitted.

PRO license trading: permitted?
Since we received many questions regarding the PRO license gifting, I‚Äôll try to clarify this here.   No, this is not permitted. The ToS ($3.7) clearly states that it is not allowed to pay with real world currency for any in-game materials, items, and so on. This includes the PRO license gifts.   This is what most inquiries were about. Given the ...

I _would_ be in the market for acquiring a single day of PRO in the near future, with which I can build a couple new ships, HQ upgrades and governorships for gateway-related projects.  But now it seems to be a market in which I have nothing to trade with but goodwill üòï

Can one gift time from a key?


[24-Feb-25 08:36 AM] tyrandia#0000
Yeah, you get timecodes


[24-Feb-25 08:36 AM] tyrandia#0000
With the Star packages and stuff.


[24-Feb-25 08:37 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I mean, if you give someone a key, they get PRO time, then they can gift it to someone else


[24-Feb-25 08:37 AM] tyrandia#0000
I don't think it works like that?


[24-Feb-25 08:37 AM] tyrandia#0000
The keys are single use.


[24-Feb-25 08:38 AM] mrsmith33#0000
you gift a key, the receiver gifts days of PRO license


[24-Feb-25 08:38 AM] tyrandia#0000
Oh. Maybe. Hmm.


[24-Feb-25 08:39 AM] tyrandia#0000
That's so... confusing the system they made.


[24-Feb-25 08:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
I feel like if someone spends some time brainstorming all the possibilities of sharing days around, it could be massively abused


[24-Feb-25 08:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
like 1 person activates a key and shares days to all sorts of random people who each need only 1 day to do stuff


[24-Feb-25 09:37 AM] akyantor#0000
It's possible, but no doubt they'd have the data to see if someone was doing that... wouldn't be hard to spot


[24-Feb-25 09:37 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd suspect it would be considered not in the spirit of the intended use of the gifting feature

they opened the floodgates with that change, but to be fair it's not a big deal. I think everyone should have PRO and developers need extra $

[24-Feb-25 09:58 AM] allocater#0000
oh wait there is a new feature? I thought it's about the 1-month-gift-code


[24-Feb-25 09:59 AM] archielvahr#0000
I ended up with extra time cause I bought a year when they had the last sale, so if you line up a bunch of ships, let me know!


[24-Feb-25 10:00 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah it's the new `gift` command. Different setup from the old keys, but sort of similar in some of the implementation details (reverts to free if you didn't already have basic, etc)


[24-Feb-25 10:01 AM] allocater#0000
I am so confused, they made a 180. 

First it was ok
> One could argue that trading in-game materials for real world currency has been possible before, the license gifts are just another item.

then it was a grey-area:
> Given the ToS, this seems like a grey area. 

then they outlaw it:
> it is not permitted to exchange PRO license gifts for in-game valuables (money, materials, ‚Ä¶).

Agreed. Would have been smart to have been clear from the off.


[24-Feb-25 10:04 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think generally everyone follows all the rules of the game so they don't have to be too strict about any of it. Unlike other MMOs where they are constantly banning huge waves of players.


[24-Feb-25 10:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
Because I am constantly giving out ADI grants and getting 1 AIC contracts for giant stacks of materials, it's impossible to separate out any of my transactions. So I imagine they would only go after very egregious rulebreakers


[24-Feb-25 10:06 AM] allocater#0000
it's unenforcable. So I don't understand why they a) add such a feature, and then b) restrict it in unenforcable ways.


[24-Feb-25 10:06 AM] archielvahr#0000
And I think the only people who would really benefit (in an egregious and obvious way)  would be the new player selling a month and suddenly getting 10m AIC or some sort of mega-whale


[24-Feb-25 10:07 AM] archielvahr#0000

[24-Feb-25 10:14 AM] max.kalina#0000
I guess money flow to developers could raise up the speed of implementing new features, but sure there shouldn't be imbalance between real money influence on player growth and newcomers starts possibilities. 
The price for one day could be reasonable, not a million AIC for month, maybe 10.000 per day to prevent quick grow of giving. But anyway I couldn't grant even a day due to my lifetime subscription üòÖ

I've expressed doubts before that he's even human.  He may be a bot.  He never talks in any chat.  He's not in any Discords related to the game.


[25-Feb-25 06:44 AM] katinga#0000
he runs immediately after an election is over


[25-Feb-25 06:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
he might just be a player thats doesnt speak english, but it is definitely plausible to say he has a bot running for the election things


[25-Feb-25 06:45 AM] katinga#0000
and he's everywhere


[25-Feb-25 06:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, but I feel as though it would be pretty hard to get a bot to effectively do all things in the game, at least expanding new bases and planets would need some amount of planning for sure.


[25-Feb-25 06:47 AM] bookliko#0000

The margins for error in this game are so high, you wouldn't need to make it do very well. Making a bot for this game would be relatively easy I think. At least compared to the effort some of y'all put into your spreadsheets and other tools, a halfway decent bot would be simple by comparison.

If screeps bots can be sophisticated (and they are, that's the point of the game), then this game is definitely doable.


[25-Feb-25 10:28 PM] pagy1234#0000

I legit cant get a single sale recently since my prices keep getting undercut so fast


[27-Feb-25 07:51 AM] zipatsu#0000
Private suppliers most likely, I know there's at least a few people going around that are / were leasing permits from players to supply them with H2O ‚úåÔ∏è


[27-Feb-25 07:53 AM] zipatsu#0000
Also possible that they're still working through H2O they bought for a lower amount so they've got more room to lower the price while still profiting.


[27-Feb-25 08:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
Makes sense, still suprised that the playerbase is that resilient, would have though that some people would just leave the market


[27-Feb-25 01:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think for DW, since the inputs are so simple, most people dedicated to DW production also make their own H2O. And they are probably doing a mix of RATs and DW, and using the H2O at FRMs. 

And DW is great profit at any price above 90, imo.


[27-Feb-25 01:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
But if you are doing less than 20k DW at a time on the CX, it can all move quite quickly

I did not realize how long a production cycle for MTP is üò≠


[22-Mar-25 07:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
Seems like it takes nearly 10 days


[22-Mar-25 07:50 AM] evov#0000
And the fact that the base that makes it, is likely the same base that uses it, means it's usually much more likely that the people who make it are the same who use it. Which means much lower traded volume available.


[22-Mar-25 08:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, no kidding. I‚Äôd sell it to the CX myself if I wasn‚Äôt just leaving money on the table by not making MEA out of it


[22-Mar-25 08:28 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I guess that partially explains why the MEA prices have stayed so high. Even if a bunch of people jumped into making it, their first few MTP are probably only just now rolling off the line


[22-Mar-25 08:33 AM] evov#0000
I'd be willing to bet there's a few people right now re-working their FP bases to squeeze in an IVP or two.


[22-Mar-25 08:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
I very nearly turned my entire Norwick base into IVP, but I‚Äôm still attached to making FIM üòÑ


[22-Mar-25 08:36 AM] sidepipe#0000

ü§£ 

[22-Mar-25 11:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
It would be interesting to sell MTP and just have a base full of IVP. Interesting but probably not great. Heh


[22-Mar-25 11:19 AM] archielvahr#0000
In theory, MTP is the hard part to make. So if you could control the price for it, you could capture most of the profit from MEA. Then random newbies could buy the MTP and make MEA since it‚Äôs so easy.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[22-Mar-25 11:26 AM] superbadsounds#0000
Before the MEA spike, it was almost impossible to get rid of MTP. I'll be curious to see how long demand can keep up if anyone does pursue supplying it.

You can ping me in this server or DM me in discord.


[22-Mar-25 08:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
I considered trying that with a full base or two of IVP - I assume there are definitely people out there just crushing out MEA with inputs from the CX. But it seems to easy to just tear down some FP and make IVP instead if CX prices get high enough to make it worth it


[22-Mar-25 08:36 PM] lax9552#0000

You sent me the wrong contract and I filled it.


[23-Mar-25 03:45 AM] allocater#0000
I can guarantee MTP demand of 300 per day, since I run MEA production without IVPs and MTP supply will be depleted in 2 week üòÖ  IVPs should also make more money then FPs so we should push the CX price of MTP up.


[23-Mar-25 04:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
are there really no sales for MTP at all on the CX?


[23-Mar-25 04:36 AM] pagy1234#0000

there's about 3-4k MTP still at MOR / BEN cx's. Little bit expensive though.

seems like a universe wide shortage

[30-Mar-25 02:22 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I've had similar bugs in the flight path screen, which have almost always been solvable by changing the amount of fuel in the tanks.

Maybe keep the flight screen open and dump/reload fuel or try different amounts of fuel.


[30-Mar-25 02:23 PM] katinga#0000
they don't like full tanks?  I like full tanks


[30-Mar-25 02:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000

have you flown the 5K before? iirc there's certain builds where the ship is actually too large/heavy for FTL travel

What's the point of adding them to the game then?

so this is what I was talking about - CptColeslaw ran into something similar with his ship where he couldn't fly it out of the system


[30-Mar-25 03:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
apparently upgrading the FTL is what made it work, like a HYR or something like that

I have half that much on my BLU, though


[30-Mar-25 03:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
FWIW, this one seems to fly just fine, but it's also a lower volume

[30-Mar-25 03:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
It's not the bells & whistles tho, it's the volume of the ship. yours and his are both 6121 m^3


[30-Mar-25 03:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
try making a few blueprints and messing around in BTF to see if you have the same problem. either smaller fuel tanks (to lower volume) or a beefier reactor should handle it


[30-Mar-25 03:21 PM] katinga#0000
BTF?


[30-Mar-25 03:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's frustrating because as far as I know those volume limits aren't really published anywhere


[30-Mar-25 03:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah, `BTF BP-VQBF-7216` will let you test flights with your HCB blueprint for example


[30-Mar-25 03:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm guessing the cheapest (down)grade that will get it flying is medium fuel tanks


[30-Mar-25 09:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Was it too heavy to take off?


[30-Mar-25 09:58 PM] max.kalina#0000

[30-Mar-25 10:03 PM] max.kalina#0000
I tried different combinations and guess the problem is in low power of quick charge FTL reactor with 5K cargo bay.
If I change cargo bay to 2K, it is ok.
If I change FTL reactor to Standart with 5K it is ok


[30-Mar-25 10:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
wow I guess I am very lucky I put small tanks in mine üò¨


[30-Mar-25 10:13 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh yeah, mine flies basically only at 100% reactor usage.


[30-Mar-25 10:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
this reveals something we don't really understand about FTL flight. there must be a charge limit or something


[30-Mar-25 10:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
If anyone figures out the details, I think it should be posted in https://discord.com/channels/667551433503014924/1007729549087342592

That's the PRUN community tools blueprint research channel


[31-Mar-25 01:14 AM] evov#0000
This is the HCB config I use / make / sell. ( probably about 10+ of these ships flying around now )
The FTL engine is capped out  I think. Pretty sure it's volume related.

So if you're planning to build a HCB with a volume that exceeds 5837m^3 - double check it with test fights before building it.

[31-Mar-25 02:14 AM] max.kalina#0000
So it need large FTL tank to fly


[31-Mar-25 02:14 AM] evov#0000
No. I think it needs the large STL tank to be dropped down to a medium


[31-Mar-25 02:15 AM] evov#0000
I suspect, the large stl tank is what's pushing it over a volume limit.

I can't say I love that you've got to unpack them manually... that said, still has potential as a modest QoL improvement without automatic consumption of bundles.


[31-Mar-25 09:28 AM] bookliko#0000
Not sure if this is a net gain in QoL. To use the feature, one needs to transport all the MAT's to one (manufacturing) planet, use 35 area and even more PIO+SET. Than transport again to CX for further distribution.


[31-Mar-25 09:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this works out. But there's a small part of me that just wants to become a consumable packing compay üòÑ


[31-Mar-25 10:06 AM] zipatsu#0000
I just do it like that for my bases. Makes no sense to me to first produce all the consumables, ship them to a planet to combine them into packages and then ship those packages to the CX where you hope / expect people to now pay extra for the consumables because they're bundled?

[31-Mar-25 10:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think this is the only use case I imagine. Supplying sponsored bases. But now that we have multi-item contracts, resupplying them is way easier. so.... don' t need the packaging.


[31-Mar-25 10:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
And if you are actually doing a ton of PIO work and area to bundle up the mats.. at least make them compress drastically better or something.


[31-Mar-25 10:58 PM] archielvahr#0000

I've been under the impression that RATs are naturally part rodent.. crops tend to attract such creatures and I haven't read one thing about there being space cats to help control those populations. 

I bet every RAT produced has a non-zero amount of rat.. yay for more protein!


[01-Apr-25 08:57 PM] exeler#0000
You mean you don't get your RATs from the vermin farm world?

They compress nicely into space ready shelf stable pellets that can be fed to the masses

Everyone, since I doing a long contract with LAXY and I have some FF spare in my warehouse.

[08-Apr-25 11:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
I personally think they‚Äôd be very useful for the rented bases. Maybe I‚Äôll manufacture a few and throw them on the market


[08-Apr-25 11:47 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think it'll be tough to keep them priced in sync with the market. If MEA goes up, then people will buy them out just to unpack them and sell the MEA straight.

Just like people would shuck hard drives back in the day


[08-Apr-25 11:48 AM] archielvahr#0000
Buy external drives, throw out the enclosure, put the drive in a machine


[08-Apr-25 12:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs true, but does it matter if you‚Äôre making a profit on the MEA you put into it? And maybe a little extra on the other consumables as well üòÑ


[08-Apr-25 12:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
I haven‚Äôt looked at the price of the other things that go into them, but I feel like the MEA price change would have to be pretty significant to take on the rest of the stuff profitably as well


[08-Apr-25 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
I guess to use your metaphor, you have to pay $300 for that hard drive, but the company selling the enclosure doesn‚Äôt pay that much


[08-Apr-25 12:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. I think bundling generally is a good way to extract value (that's why I try to sell whole ships, after all).


[08-Apr-25 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just that you have to remember to reprice your Sci bundles as MEA changes. Someone else buying them out to sell them is fine. but it's a bummer if you forget you have a bunch listed at a price that no longer makes sense üòÑ


[08-Apr-25 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
speaking as someone who has had stuff on the CX for multiple years without selling it because I forget to relist it üòÜ


[08-Apr-25 12:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
100% true. I just approach it like I approach all flipping - if I was happy to sell it for x AIC a year ago, I‚Äôm not too upset if it sells for x AIC now. Not as much profit as I could have made, but still made a profit üòÅ


[08-Apr-25 12:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
But it‚Äôll be interesting to see if people list and forget, or if the bundles track their CX value pretty closely

true, he had what.. like 20 IDC bases?


[08-Apr-25 04:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
my two IDC bases make 70 a day, and he made 677 per day


[08-Apr-25 04:07 PM] akyantor#0000
I guess it depends on how much mea he was buying vs in-house production


[08-Apr-25 04:08 PM] archielvahr#0000
he only made 200 per day, so if those IDC numbers are right, he was buying a lot.


[08-Apr-25 04:08 PM] archielvahr#0000

[09-Apr-25 03:27 AM] evov#0000
If they're IDC bases, and you WANT an idc base, it costs around 10mil in infrastructure costs to set up. Max Base establishment fee is 10mil.


[09-Apr-25 10:21 AM] archielvahr#0000
On YA-646c, taxes are zero so I bet they have no balance.

[09-Apr-25 01:11 PM] allocater#0000

I am ready to accept 2 base teleports, but have no ships for an invasion

if people are interested, I can send a ship out this weekend


[10-Apr-25 05:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
I decided against adding another IDC base. I think eventually they will reduce the price on it. But also those systems are super far away and I did go through every govt motion and I'm pretty confident they have 0 balance


[10-Apr-25 05:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
So it probably makes sense to take several of them to consolidate shipping, and I don't have those kinds of permits to spare


[10-Apr-25 05:50 PM] archielvahr#0000
@allocater  I can always gift you time, then you can fly more ships for a bit

{Reactions}
‚ù§Ô∏è 

[10-Apr-25 06:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
I do agree they'll reduce the price on it long-term - I view this as more of a short-term opportunistic thing. just get in and grab the SCI while they're still there, and then we can ditch the planets when the nerf happens


[10-Apr-25 06:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've also only got one spare permit atm


[10-Apr-25 06:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
are you just wanting me to bring over and drop the stuff for the CM? and can you share the dashboard? I think it's still best to drop bases in the last 24 hours. idk if firefreak could still log on and withdraw the establishment money before then


[10-Apr-25 07:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't believe he could after a coliq


[10-Apr-25 07:29 PM] pagy1234#0000
I see that you guys are talking about taking over a planet or something? how does that even work? and how does it benefit you guys?


[10-Apr-25 07:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
Well, originally firefreak had a bunch of private IDC planets that he ran himself and kept everyone else out of (with 10M base fee like Nyx), and someone came up with a plan to sneak the planets out from under him


[10-Apr-25 07:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
But now, it‚Äôs more just taking over the empty planets because each of them has pops for a single IDC base and it‚Äôd be a shame if those went to waste üòÑ


[10-Apr-25 08:05 PM] archielvahr#0000
He basically designed the planets to be single IDC base planets


[10-Apr-25 08:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh really?


[10-Apr-25 11:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
exactly 400 sci, no taxes, max base establishment fee, then 1 STS, 1 INF, 1 art cafe


[10-Apr-25 11:54 PM] archielvahr#0000
Paid for each immigration project in the same motion as the contribution, so the planet never held cash


[11-Apr-25 12:02 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Wild


[11-Apr-25 12:41 AM] allocater#0000
yes, but I realize the bottle neck will be the 240 RBH/RSE to build all those bases. I only have 1 kit ready on Malahat


[11-Apr-25 12:53 AM] allocater#0000
also the warehouse will not hold an entire kit


[11-Apr-25 12:54 AM] allocater#0000
so it will either be complicated small contracting or only via own ships from orbit


[11-Apr-25 12:57 AM] allocater#0000
the dash was only in prun and tracking the election times

[11-Apr-25 08:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs actually a good point to remember if we ever want to make our own private planet/system - don‚Äôt build a WAR so they have to send 10M _and_ a ship for each base


[11-Apr-25 08:48 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Probably not a big deal for someone with spare 10M


[11-Apr-25 08:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
Probably not, just adds an extra barrier to entry


[11-Apr-25 08:46 PM] evov#0000
Sounds like it's a lot more work than simply going and starting a new planet for yourself though.


[11-Apr-25 08:53 PM] evov#0000
And it's kinda hard to assess the "push back" from the community that might come along with stealing planets. If you're talking about IDC bases, having 2 people join at the same time, you're probably going to lose a lot more than 10mil worth of productivity on those permits while waiting for pop to fill.


[11-Apr-25 08:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
Well, that‚Äôs part of why we never did go ahead with it


[11-Apr-25 08:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
And now it‚Äôs not stealing since they‚Äôre vacant - just adopting üòÑ


[11-Apr-25 09:05 PM] evov#0000
Yea, might make sense now if someone is really interested in IDC's and has enough permits. I think I'd probably still be inclined to build my own closer to ANT, even if it's more costly in the short term.

Based on @lowstrife‚Äôs detailed feedback combined with our own judgement and taking near-future recipe plans into account, we‚Äôll adjust the prices at which market makers buy commodities as follows:   ADR: 58000 ‚Üí 70000 AIR: 185000 ‚Üí 200000 CBL: 91000 ‚Üí 91000 CBM: 63000...

Looks like another IDC nerf is on the horizon! 15300 -> 11k over a month

I have no idea how governing works so i cant really defend you

probably not imporantant but just letting your know

It‚Äôs Malahat all over again

yeah idk how his math works, but im trusting your spreadsheet


[14-Apr-25 11:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
Same guy, same complaint, probably same outcome (which is that it will go nowhere)


[14-Apr-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Have we ever seen his maths?


[14-Apr-25 11:33 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Or does he just make crazy statements


[14-Apr-25 11:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
Uhm, not sure. If it‚Äôs anything like Malahat we might not


[14-Apr-25 11:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
But seriously, don‚Äôt argue with him too much, just let him wear himself out


[14-Apr-25 11:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
The argument is free publicity for whenever he tries to run for Phobos gov


[14-Apr-25 11:39 AM] akyantor#0000
Wow, some angry folks. I don't know why people feel like they're entitled to a bunch of free money via IDC farming.

[14-Apr-25 12:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah, it's crazy to me how invested some people are into the "I will quit if I can't make IDC"


[14-Apr-25 12:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
And it always seems to come from "This is way better than everything else in the game, and making IDC is _my thing_ and if I can't make it, I'll quit"


[14-Apr-25 12:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
Which is basically just "I want it to be unbalanced"

we don't know how many people have quit the game because they can see that to be succesful just make 1 thing


[14-Apr-25 12:44 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, can't be much satisfaction from IDC farming. Whereas building up the supply chain for all the ship shields has been super rewarding due to some of the complexity.


[14-Apr-25 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
I might invest into PG base


[14-Apr-25 12:46 PM] marat_sh#0000
looks like we gonna need more of it


[14-Apr-25 03:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
I am not a gov expert, but I am curios, for UNI, why people use COF instead of REA? REA is cheaper (currently) and has same consumption


[14-Apr-25 03:36 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, COF or REA are both super expensive compared to HD, IDC or TUB


[14-Apr-25 03:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
True, TUB is so way cheaper


[14-Apr-25 03:39 PM] akyantor#0000
Easy to get caught out on the fact that IDC/HD are only consumed every 10 days not every 3 too.


[14-Apr-25 03:40 PM] akyantor#0000
HD is currently the cheapest for filling Deimos


[14-Apr-25 03:40 PM] akyantor#0000
I daresay it moves around based upon supply though


[14-Apr-25 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
Mostly it's that sometimes REA, TUB, and HD are sold out on the market


[14-Apr-25 03:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
It has been getting better though


[14-Apr-25 03:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
OLF is often out of stock, MHP is better now than it used to be. (But it's 100% OOG production)


[14-Apr-25 03:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
TUB just runs out quickly.


[14-Apr-25 03:41 PM] akyantor#0000
I've fortunately my own supply of TUB, so that's a fall back for me.

[14-Apr-25 03:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah Phobos needs 4000. usually there's not 4k up. Right now you could do a couple planets but that probably won't fill that quickly


[14-Apr-25 03:44 PM] akyantor#0000
It is a challenge on a larger planet, market is thin for some goods.


[14-Apr-25 03:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
Do we need a TUB factory? I‚Äôd be happy to add to my gov goods portfolio üòÑ

I don't see the point of playing an economy sim and then spending all your effort on basically ignoring the entire player interaction part of it while generating infinity+1 currency from selling to the machine MM.  I understand there needs to be an influx of credits somehow but surely the devs can come up with a better, more involved, method of achieving that in a way that benefits everyone.

As an example they could work on expanding the quest contract system to encourage the development of empty planets, perhaps even terraforming them in the process to be more bountiful on resources or maybe even setting up and maintaining NPC bases as a community goal which would then replace the current endless MM system with one where the players themselves directly influence the rates and amounts of those materials / items showing up on the CX through upgrading those bases while still leaving room for real people to profit as there'd be a time / opportunity element to the NPC production.

's more of a random late night imagination than a well thought idea but I've been against the IDC cash printer ever since learning about its existence ‚úåÔ∏è


[14-Apr-25 06:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I think it makes more sense to buff what‚Äôs weak than to nerf what‚Äôs good


[14-Apr-25 06:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It would be cool if we could terraform and the cost like POPI would change based on the infra built and what is supplied to it

{Reactions}

[14-Apr-25 06:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or like a way to densify plot density on a planet so more plots can be made available


[14-Apr-25 06:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that would be awesome.


[16-Apr-25 04:04 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is there a table with all building costs (for all levels) for POPI buildings?
Alternatively, what tool can sort planets by total population? Probably could query FIO for this


[16-Apr-25 04:04 AM] mrsmith33#0000

Lots of items in there that aren't available on the CX. So I've got estimated numbers (yellow).


[16-Apr-25 04:14 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Thanks, figured it out
Formula is `=ROUND(BASE_COST * POWER(1,2; LEVEL - 1); 0)`

Looks 100% correct

[16-Apr-25 04:16 AM] evov#0000
Possibly. I'm not sure how it works with rounding (especially for bui's that have single item inputs) I just know it goes up 20% per tier. So it starts getting kinda expensive.


[16-Apr-25 04:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Rounding looks to be standard, since lower ones (<5) are rounded down, and higher are rounded up (>5)


[16-Apr-25 04:18 AM] evov#0000
lvl2 costs for SST is correct.


[16-Apr-25 04:19 AM] mrsmith33#0000

Do repairs ever cost the TSH,TRU or PSL materials?


[17-Apr-25 06:35 AM] evov#0000
TRU, yes. TSH, yes if it's a HOT planet. PSL - none that I'm aware of.


[17-Apr-25 06:38 AM] evov#0000
e.g. - List of repair materials for my operation if I were to repair things every 90 days (*which I don't do anymore, just haven't modified this tool since I changed repair timings )

So potentially you'll use all these for repairs depending on your buildings / planets you're on etc.
