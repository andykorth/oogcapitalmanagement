When we get around to making governing stuff (INS first), we should probably have a short list of people who actually govern


[11-Jun-24 01:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I know there's a couple people that puppet govern planets through other players, so it would be nice to get their input


[11-Jun-24 01:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But I personally don't know who they are ;(


[11-Jun-24 01:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I know KAWA governs a bunch


[11-Jun-24 02:14 PM] tanda#0000
we still have quite a few OOG members in here who might be able to provide insight as well


[11-Jun-24 02:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Hmm your office list didn't load. I will have to mess with the sheet again


[12-Jun-24 11:24 AM] acramernc#0000
I'm curious about why people become governors, is there a profit incentive, or is it more of a "somebody has to do it" kind of thing


[12-Jun-24 11:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
Probably more of a ‚Äúsomeone has to‚Äù for most planets - taxes can, but don‚Äôt always pay for the upkeep of a planet


[12-Jun-24 11:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think it‚Äôs fun as well because managing a planet is a very big-picture sort of activity. Lots of planning to grow and shrink populations appropriately


[12-Jun-24 11:42 AM] acramernc#0000
interesting, part of me feels like there should be more of a reason than that, but it seems to be working well enough as is


[12-Jun-24 11:43 AM] sidepipe#0000
It can also be very thankless - if you do your job well, no one notices. If you mess up once, people can get very critical very quickly üòÑ

[12-Jun-24 11:44 AM] acramernc#0000
it would be cool if they gave like an extra 5% productivity to all corp members on the planet controlled by their corp


[12-Jun-24 11:44 AM] acramernc#0000
yeah i've seen some scathing commentary in the ufo discord lol


[12-Jun-24 11:45 AM] acramernc#0000
don't you get to set taxes as governor? couldn't you just increase it arbitrarily?


[12-Jun-24 11:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
You definitely can, but it‚Äôs hard to estimate tax income. It‚Äôs easy to figure out population upkeep (since it‚Äôs just based on pop figures), but taxes aren‚Äôt just a set $ amount per pop


[12-Jun-24 11:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
And people tend not to like any changes to taxes ever


[12-Jun-24 11:47 AM] sidepipe#0000
Unless they‚Äôre lower üòÑ


[12-Jun-24 11:47 AM] .urpalhal#0000
People like their money too much


[12-Jun-24 11:47 AM] .urpalhal#0000
The changes coming with the governance update will be interesting


[12-Jun-24 11:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
I mean, most people are pretty reasonable. But the unreasonable ones are always the loudest and most personal üòÑ


[12-Jun-24 11:49 AM] acramernc#0000
i guess i'm not crunching the numbers as much as the more established players, but i've never payed any attention to the taxes, i'm surprised people aren't just cranking them up


[12-Jun-24 11:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
Tax increases do happen, especially on the more established worlds with lots of higher-level pops. But for the most part, PIO and SET are pretty cheap


[12-Jun-24 11:50 AM] sidepipe#0000
And overall, taxes are a pretty tiny part of any established player‚Äôs expenses


[12-Jun-24 11:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
So I think most people don‚Äôt pay attention to how much tax they pay unless it‚Äôs going up. Just like real life üòÅ


[12-Jun-24 11:56 AM] archielvahr#0000
For a lot of products, taxes are less than 1%. Like DW... 7 DW for 2 AIC


[12-Jun-24 11:58 AM] acramernc#0000
yeah i'll be interested to see how things change once the gov context is implemented and it's easier to see how much you are losing/making on a planet


[12-Jun-24 11:59 AM] tanda#0000
is the politics update not going to change things a lot?


[12-Jun-24 12:00 PM] acramernc#0000
idk, seems to me like it's just going to spread the gov role into a bunch of people and make it easier to manage the finances on a planet basis


[12-Jun-24 12:00 PM] acramernc#0000
until they implement the commodity market thing they mentioned it won't change anything for me, since i'm not a governor


[12-Jun-24 12:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the meta for governing will change a lot- which people get on how many planets, who is responsible for what, how much information various people get about how a planet works, etc.


[12-Jun-24 12:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The planetary gov gets their own bank account


[12-Jun-24 12:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can show what‚Äôs in the test server if anyone would like to see

[12-Jun-24 04:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Do you have info on what resources each planet uses ?


[12-Jun-24 04:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
/how much


[12-Jun-24 04:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
Resources- as in the stuff extracted from the planet? Or what they put into their POPI?


[12-Jun-24 04:09 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't have POPI info


[12-Jun-24 04:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
1. POPI
2. Oh well


[12-Jun-24 04:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'll just reach out to them whenver we get there


[12-Jun-24 04:12 PM] archielvahr#0000
POPI stuff is really hard to keep track of. When you  add stuff to it, it resets the timer and adds the new contribution to the previous total. At some point it resets but I don't really know when


[12-Jun-24 05:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I just like it... for KAWA, with our low CoGM for most upkeep items, it can sometimes be slightly profitable. But not enough to justify the amount of work put into it. If I wanted my time to just make money, I would leave governing to others. But it's an interesting layer of the game that I just think is fun ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø (and might be more fun after the update)


[12-Jun-24 05:23 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
overall though, I think anyone who isn't governing won't really notice the update at all. Anyone governing will have *a lot* to learn and adjust too

[15-Jun-24 09:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So for the PE base, it might not be entirely necessary because 2 INS bases would be taking in a bit below 20% of weekly trade, but having a Haphestus base to make other stuff for similar projects would be nice either way


[15-Jun-24 09:56 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And before we do it, why do we think that INS is overpriced ?


[15-Jun-24 09:57 PM] tanda#0000
because it needs to be used more


[15-Jun-24 09:57 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I made a base in prunplanner and it's making 50k at 125%, with 37d roi


[15-Jun-24 09:57 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Ask/Ask


[15-Jun-24 09:57 PM] tanda#0000
and decreasing the price of it enables more bases on more worlds


[15-Jun-24 09:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't think the price of INS is what's holding back people from expanding, just the fact that people go for the closest to CX planets that aren't full. I haven't really seen INS being the deciding factor for why I personally wouldn't colonize a planet


[15-Jun-24 09:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well


[15-Jun-24 09:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Do you have an example of a good planet that people would otherwise eagerly construct on and how much of the base cost is INS ?


[15-Jun-24 10:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
For a 500 area permit base it costs about 500k-600k in INS


[15-Jun-24 10:00 PM] tanda#0000
SE-110 system


[15-Jun-24 10:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
For example my halcyon base needed 10k INS for the full 1000 area


[15-Jun-24 10:01 PM] tanda#0000
two jumps away from ANT, current best HYF, H2O extraction location, a prime spot for C production, and an excellent RAT and DW production location


[15-Jun-24 10:01 PM] tanda#0000
every base in that system costs 1m+

[15-Jun-24 10:05 PM] tanda#0000
my 3 base plan for that system in the future, every base has 500k+ added to it from INS cost. Obviously it can't be eliminated, but reducing it will make the planets more viable for both settlement and maintenance


[15-Jun-24 10:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'm looking at an Ice Station Alpha base plan, and reducing INS to 115/u gives a 90k discount


[15-Jun-24 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
even with 0 experts, a pp3 base making INS only has a 25 day return

The INS is a lot lower than how much it usually is, I'll try the difference between 150/u and 115/u

I'll check my base again

Pretty good


[15-Jun-24 10:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
COGM for INS will also be marginally lower depending on what the THF price will be, but I think the biggest single cost is the PE


[15-Jun-24 10:24 PM] tanda#0000
that's tied to C


[15-Jun-24 10:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
For the 4 million price of 2 INS bases, the discounts from about 23 bases being built in SE-110 would be equal


[15-Jun-24 10:25 PM] tanda#0000
well, I definitely have 3 bases planned in that system, lol


[15-Jun-24 10:27 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I mean, our group probably won't be making 23 bases there, but it's help for the faction as a whole, which is what CULT is about


[15-Jun-24 10:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Plus some unforeseen benefits of more people in SE-110 making food and whatnot


[15-Jun-24 10:29 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We should probably try to advertise it then. Tell people that SE-110 is awesome and that INS is suddenly way cheaper


[15-Jun-24 10:29 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

I think at one point folks were looking to secure a supply of AR? Do you still need that so you don't need to buy it off the market? If so, I may to help with that bit of the initiative, if there was interest.


[16-Jun-24 02:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
What price then ? I don't see ourselves deviating from the PiBoy number much until we have more PP3's working


[16-Jun-24 02:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We planned to just grab it from CX, Tanda didn't think our demand of it would affect the market


[16-Jun-24 02:44 PM] akyantor#0000
Ok, fair enough. I may still go ahead and offer it a bit below CX to assist with the effort, wouldn't be for a week or so anyway.

[16-Jun-24 02:53 PM] razenpok#0000
... which is weird tbh


[16-Jun-24 02:54 PM] akyantor#0000
Not just transaction costs, but flow also makes it a bit harder. If there was more volume flowing through the market for the material it's a bit harder to flip stuff and not get burned as the market moves with supply and demand. This market is generally a bit slower, so price isn't quite as dynamic.


[16-Jun-24 02:57 PM] razenpok#0000
ChatGPT also suggests

[16-Jun-24 03:10 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, some activity is expected. i.e. buying goods, and re-listing at a higher price. It'd probably only be considered manipulative if multiple parties were co-ordinating to fix a price.


[16-Jun-24 03:12 PM] flor2081#0000

thats about the only thing i can remember from my economics class this year

I guess technically this right here is a cartel of sorts, but rather than trying to push up the price the plan is to push down the price. üòõ

i mean, you're not doing it to your advantage, so idk hahah


[16-Jun-24 03:14 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, kind of atypical. An ethical cartel. üòõ


[16-Jun-24 03:22 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Doing this irl without the input of people affected would be unethical but we're doing it for fun in game so it's cool üòé


[18-Jun-24 08:17 PM] pi3142718#0000
Yeah, that‚Äôs part of the market. Lots of flipping. The only way I was able to overcome it is having at least 50k INS in all my CX warehouses to relist. Going 10 lower than me shouldn‚Äôt incur flippers, but it‚Äôll probably be eaten by natural demand pretty fast.


[18-Jun-24 08:22 PM] pi3142718#0000
But if you all have the inventory to cover some portion of the natural demand I‚Äôd back you a bit higher or the same price


[18-Jun-24 08:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
Oh hey, welcome üôÇ


[18-Jun-24 08:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
@histidinedwarf is the main driving force between the INS project - if you read back a bit, there was a fair amount of interest in trying to lower the INS price, and people were discussing setting up a few bases of PP3s


[18-Jun-24 08:46 PM] sidepipe#0000
For what it‚Äôs worth, the flipping was mostly unrelated. I had 20k in stock and listed some at a lower price for quick sale, but apparently it sold too quick üòÅ


[18-Jun-24 08:46 PM] pi3142718#0000
We‚Äôve been talking in PMs. You‚Äôll need quite a few PP3 bases


[18-Jun-24 08:47 PM] pi3142718#0000
4-6 maybe as a rough estimate?


[18-Jun-24 08:47 PM] pi3142718#0000
I use a 9 PP3 / 2 LAB setup


[18-Jun-24 08:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
That seems about right. Depending on how many people are interested, I have a lab base that I can pivot to all /mostly THF to free up more space for PP3s


[18-Jun-24 09:16 PM] pi3142718#0000
Shipping THF can be a pain, especially since it‚Äôs burnt so quickly


[18-Jun-24 09:16 PM] pi3142718#0000
I found the loss in INS is minimal


[18-Jun-24 09:17 PM] pi3142718#0000
But you still need external THF so some more lab would help


[19-Jun-24 10:47 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
First image is 11 PP3 base, second image is 9 PP3 + 2 LAB

[19-Jun-24 10:48 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
The base with labs makes ~250 less INS per day


[19-Jun-24 10:50 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
With 5 experts, the full PP3 base import weight is 254t and LAB base is about 200t


[19-Jun-24 10:51 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I suppose on starter ships it might be annoying


[19-Jun-24 11:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
Well, we have the advantage of farming out the bases to many people. I can see how managing that would be a pain for one person


[19-Jun-24 12:18 PM] pi3142718#0000
Also a pain distributing that much THF (like 50 per day, right?). Easier to distribute a little THF and a little of its constituents


[19-Jun-24 12:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well,50-70/day/base


[19-Jun-24 12:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
THF


[19-Jun-24 12:21 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
AR is more annoying to transport, it's 1m^3

[19-Jun-24 12:39 PM] pi3142718#0000
You need a lot of it


[19-Jun-24 03:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
@histidinedwarf do you have an estimate of how much THF you'll need once everything's up and running?


[19-Jun-24 03:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
110-140/day total, depending on experts


[19-Jun-24 03:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've got 1.5k at ANT, but if you're wanting to buy from me I wanna make sure I have enough capacity üôÇ

140/day/base at 5 experts?


[19-Jun-24 03:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yes


[19-Jun-24 03:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
nvm


[19-Jun-24 03:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
140/day for both bases


[19-Jun-24 03:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
nice. I'll start changing some of my labs to THF just to stockpile a bit more in advance then.


[19-Jun-24 03:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
I have way too much DDT sitting around right now anyway


[19-Jun-24 03:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
Did you have a fixed price for THF in mind?


[19-Jun-24 03:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
400/u ? That's about the price of THF.AI1


[19-Jun-24 04:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
Let's start with something lower like 320. I realize the CX prices are higher than that right now, but not a lot moves at that price it seems


[19-Jun-24 04:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
I wanna be cheaper than buying off the CX üòÅ


[19-Jun-24 04:16 PM] sidepipe#0000

[21-Jun-24 07:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah, sure


[21-Jun-24 09:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@razesdark @tanda Sidepipe agreed to help fund the bases with a 0% loan. If you don't have the money immediately, ask them


[21-Jun-24 10:00 PM] tanda#0000
I actually could use it to help cover the cost of intial stock up. I'll have to figure out the exact amount


[22-Jun-24 06:36 AM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, the initial stock up is going to be quite something. 1M for a week, 700k i C alone.
I assume there is going to be some arrangements where I sell to whoever runs the INS bases?


[22-Jun-24 10:03 PM] pi3142718#0000
If the problem is funds for bases, I‚Äôd be willing to provide a 25% grant towards doubling your planned INS/BMP bases (and a 0% interest loan on the other 75%)

Which I guess is another 2 INS bases and maybe another partial BMP base. Happy to help with HQ upgrades too.


[22-Jun-24 10:05 PM] tanda#0000
I will totally take you up on that offer. That lets me use my funds to provide initial stock to run the base


[22-Jun-24 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
I can definitely arrange to supply you with cheaper C. My production overflow is larger than the input for that base


[22-Jun-24 10:22 PM] pi3142718#0000
Let me know what all the plans are when they‚Äôre finalized and I‚Äôll draw up contracts.


[22-Jun-24 10:25 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[22-Jun-24 10:30 PM] tanda#0000
considering we were planning on sourcing THF from sidepipe, should we consider adding one LAB base to take pressure off of them?


[22-Jun-24 10:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Fair point


[22-Jun-24 10:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@sidepipe should we ?


[22-Jun-24 10:32 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also, can you give this deal to the first half of the members we already got ? Then @sidepipe gives the full loan deal to new members ?


[22-Jun-24 10:32 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Feels weird to do it backwards


[22-Jun-24 10:34 PM] tanda#0000

speaking of. so inputs are PE AR and THF
Sidepipe is doing THF
Where's the rest coming from ?


[22-Jun-24 10:36 PM] tanda#0000
PE is covered with at least one manufacturing base on Hephaestus at this point. AR we might have to start thinking about sourcing. @avalock would you consider mining gas?


[22-Jun-24 10:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
With 4 bases maybe AR is something we should look at

that graph is really telling me that you just got a ship upgrade (even if you didn't just say that)

Not to get too sidetracked, but AEF is another item that could be made more widely available for cheaper to encourage growth


[22-Jun-24 10:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
it is an item in my PP2 base wish to make list


[22-Jun-24 10:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Oh hey would you look at that it takes PG. If only we PG were a bit cheaper


[22-Jun-24 10:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

48 per day at max experts


[22-Jun-24 11:01 PM] pi3142718#0000
Huh. So one full base nearly matches the amount traded on all the markets


[22-Jun-24 11:01 PM] pi3142718#0000
I guess it depends how profitable it is at the current price


[22-Jun-24 11:02 PM] tanda#0000
well, PG kinda takes all the profit out of it


[22-Jun-24 11:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Nova Honshu BS-788c


[22-Jun-24 11:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Speaking of money. How low can the profit go on bases we plan before it's unfair ? The PG bases were pretty darn profitable as is, so no concern there. The INS bases will be making 31k/day, 125%, if the INS is sold at 115/u. Very long ROI too which to be fair is fine if we give the money


[22-Jun-24 11:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
50k/day with 5 experts


[22-Jun-24 11:06 PM] tanda#0000
if something is unprofitable, chances are we don't really need to get involved with it, right?


[22-Jun-24 11:06 PM] tanda#0000
or at least things would be better served by tackling the more profitable precursors


[22-Jun-24 11:07 PM] avalock#0000
Tbh it's en-route to my TIO operation too... so like.... not that bad of an idea


[22-Jun-24 11:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I see the INS as more or less charity for the rest of ANT (and the other factions once the price spreads out). If we were going straight for money, we'd be making EPO bases


[22-Jun-24 11:08 PM] tanda#0000
true, though charity also extends to ourselves


[22-Jun-24 11:08 PM] tanda#0000
I'm definitely in this for cheaper Thalassa expansion


[22-Jun-24 11:10 PM] pi3142718#0000
Also be careful with PP default calculations. AR.AI1 is way out of wack right now


[22-Jun-24 11:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
For now I'll just say I'd feel iffy supporting a plan where the base would be making less than ~25k/day, 125%


[22-Jun-24 11:11 PM] tanda#0000
I'd agree. I would only do something like that in my own vertical integration

[22-Jun-24 11:14 PM] tanda#0000
oh wow, @avalock nevermind! Controlling for the wacky price at ANT right now, that AR base would make you basically nothing


[22-Jun-24 11:14 PM] pi3142718#0000
AR @ 86, THF @ 320


[22-Jun-24 11:14 PM] pi3142718#0000
And PE doing whatever PE does


[22-Jun-24 11:15 PM] avalock#0000
wait do y'all not need the AR?


[22-Jun-24 11:15 PM] pi3142718#0000
AR is not profitable, but is necessary


[22-Jun-24 11:16 PM] avalock#0000
I'm fine with doing not profitable but necessary jobs


[22-Jun-24 11:16 PM] pi3142718#0000
I've got 185 area free on KI-401d I can fill with more RIG is y'all can send down a 2k/2k or 3k/1k every few days to carry it away


[22-Jun-24 11:16 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You said you had logistics trouble, with the AR fit in ?


[22-Jun-24 11:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And how much would we need to pay for AR so it's worth your time. How much AR would it make to begin with ? If it was mentioned I missed it


[22-Jun-24 11:17 PM] pi3142718#0000
I just don't want to dedicate more time to clicking around the game. The base is easy to supply, so I don't mind facilitating a couple contracts per week


[22-Jun-24 11:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Fair, I'm clocking out at 5 bases rn


[22-Jun-24 11:17 PM] avalock#0000
no numbers were set, I'd have to put it into prunplanner or something on how much I could make


[22-Jun-24 11:18 PM] pi3142718#0000
>200/day


[22-Jun-24 11:18 PM] avalock#0000
I think its like 284/day according to @tanda


[22-Jun-24 11:18 PM] evany.#0000
want probably a bit of breathing room


[22-Jun-24 11:18 PM] evany.#0000
but yeah tanda 's right


[22-Jun-24 11:19 PM] tanda#0000
284 per day was for the plan's THF needs, that base makes 372/day of AR


[22-Jun-24 11:20 PM] pi3142718#0000
I've got room for 188/day more on KI-401d


[22-Jun-24 11:21 PM] tanda#0000
actually turns out that the amount of AR needed for 4 bases is the same as the THF need

Sounds like a full AR base would fit better

yeah, I will admit I haven't looked at the recipe in a few weeks, lol


[22-Jun-24 11:22 PM] pi3142718#0000
A full AR base on KI-401d with AR @ 86 makes 20k/day


[22-Jun-24 11:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah why is AI1 AR so hillariously expensive


[22-Jun-24 11:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It went up recently


[22-Jun-24 11:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[22-Jun-24 11:28 PM] avalock#0000

but its close enough


[22-Jun-24 11:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It'd suck to make Avacyn ship it all for storage, so I think if each INS member would just collect their share from KI it'd work


[22-Jun-24 11:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You can ship the excess to CX


[22-Jun-24 11:31 PM] avalock#0000

That sounds great! I've established the base, but its running at only 10x BMP right now. As I realized It would take me a few runs to get enough materials transported.
Plan is to get the last 10 BMPs online during next week. Would love it if I could the first 500C, then I can pick up the remainder later on during the week when the rest of the BMPs are operational, and the first batches of PE is hopefully sold

It's 500 techs per base


[25-Jun-24 10:27 PM] tanda#0000
the only alternative locally is Nike. I'm not against swapping stuff around, but even there 2k TEC is going to be a struggle


[25-Jun-24 10:27 PM] tanda#0000
apparently the governor of Aceland is abdicating as well, so there goes any cooperation there

[25-Jun-24 10:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If we don't mind the bases being on different planets we can let people build on Nike if they don't have a base there yet

Making an HQ on each new planet used for projects sounds impractical


[25-Jun-24 10:29 PM] jvaler#0000
they're still gov for another 3 weeks and the current pop program ends in 14hrs. you could get them to queue 2 up

i'm assuming the update tomorrow won't affect existing govs yet...?

[25-Jun-24 10:35 PM] jvaler#0000
they'll show up in POPR on the week the pop program is running


[25-Jun-24 10:35 PM] jvaler#0000
so not after the program is done, but during it


[25-Jun-24 10:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So how long are we gonna wait until Aceland has 2000 more techs ?


[25-Jun-24 10:39 PM] pi3142718#0000
Hard to say. On programs alone 20 weeks. Probably closer to 10 without significant POPI investment


[25-Jun-24 10:39 PM] pi3142718#0000
Maybe 6-7 with that

[25-Jun-24 10:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Where do you build all your INS bases ?


[25-Jun-24 10:40 PM] pi3142718#0000
Aceland, Nike, ZV-194b, KI-401, LS-231, and places outside of ANT


[25-Jun-24 10:40 PM] pi3142718#0000
Had to wait for pops to grow in, but I had time


[25-Jun-24 10:41 PM] pi3142718#0000
Bump up culture a bit and tecs will be happy enough in a few weeks


[25-Jun-24 10:41 PM] pi3142718#0000
Probably worth it still


[25-Jun-24 10:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't see why not spread out the bases to not wait 10 weeks


[25-Jun-24 10:43 PM] tanda#0000
I'm really not that against converting Nike to PP3 and just shipping LST off planet


[25-Jun-24 10:57 PM] evany.#0000
unfortunately my nike base is pp2 right now


[25-Jun-24 10:58 PM] tanda#0000
yeah same, I am thinking about moving it


[25-Jun-24 10:59 PM] tanda#0000
main reason I have against that is 100% shipping LST instead of being able to use the LM


[25-Jun-24 11:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Lfabs have been looking pretty good recently


[25-Jun-24 11:09 PM] tanda#0000
it's all that aluminum, lol


[25-Jun-24 11:10 PM] tanda#0000
but yeah, I could partially transition to LFABs to reduce the LST import issue


[25-Jun-24 11:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[26-Jun-24 10:34 PM] tanda#0000
so it sounds like moving the PP3's to Nike is a good idea


[26-Jun-24 10:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yes


[26-Jun-24 10:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Really, Nike is ideal

As long as you don't love your PP2 too much


[26-Jun-24 10:35 PM] tanda#0000
guess I'm setting up on ZV-194b for my PP2s


[26-Jun-24 11:04 PM] jvaler#0000
i dunno what your actual pop requirements are, i just meant there's still some time to have them run programs before their term is up. but seems like 2 isn't enough lol


[26-Jun-24 11:05 PM] tanda#0000
I believe PiBoy gave us the quote of 10-20 weeks for adequate growth


[27-Jun-24 12:47 AM] nyanism#0000
Problem there is if someone is already set up shop there, it cost even more for retooling

@puncher23 @helminsted you seemed interested in participating in the regrettably named "kevin" ?


[07-Jul-24 12:33 PM] helminsted#0000
Yes I am üòÄ


[07-Jul-24 12:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I updated #kevin-information with base plans of what we want from each base


[07-Jul-24 12:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We want 1 more person for PE and 2 more for INS


[07-Jul-24 12:37 PM] helminsted#0000
Okie dokie I'll look into it perhaps I can do the PE part of the project


[07-Jul-24 12:43 PM] helminsted#0000
I could do one of the INS as well as the PE


[07-Jul-24 01:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Pick one


[07-Jul-24 01:40 PM] helminsted#0000
Ok, the INS


[07-Jul-24 01:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@sidepipe Can you help with the $$$ ?


[07-Jul-24 02:07 PM] sidepipe#0000
yep, just lmk what the price tag for the base is üôÇ


[07-Jul-24 02:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
2.7 mil (2 mil for base + 0.7 mil for 5 days of supplies)


[07-Jul-24 02:17 PM] sidepipe#0000
gotcha - 60 days 0 interest, as usual?


[07-Jul-24 02:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@helminsted Do you agree ?


[07-Jul-24 02:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It sounds good to me


[07-Jul-24 02:20 PM] helminsted#0000
Yes, I agree


[07-Jul-24 02:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
Cool, then just lmk whenever you're planning on building the base and I'll send you the loan üôÇ


[07-Jul-24 02:23 PM] helminsted#0000
I just got off of work, I can do this good stuff immediately now that I'm back home üòÑ

The only available planet is Nike due to technician shortages


[07-Jul-24 02:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
sent, enjoy! don't pay the first installment early - it's technically 2 30 day timers, not one 60 day timer


[07-Jul-24 02:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
so if you pay the first early, you'll get a lot less time in total


[07-Jul-24 02:28 PM] helminsted#0000

[07-Jul-24 07:01 PM] tanda#0000
It's really the best summation of it. Are you looking for "why is kevin"?


[07-Jul-24 07:02 PM] sundae383#0000
that too lol


[07-Jul-24 07:03 PM] tanda#0000
kevin started because there are a lot of good planets out there that are more or less gated behind extremely high costs in secondary building mats (SEA, INS, HSE, etc)


[07-Jul-24 07:03 PM] tanda#0000
so in order to maybe help develop the Antares area a little bit better, we've started a project to try to drop the price of INS


[07-Jul-24 07:04 PM] tanda#0000
we're still in the bootstrapping phase right now, and we have a couple more openings


[07-Jul-24 07:05 PM] sundae383#0000
if i wasn't so new id help lol


[07-Jul-24 07:05 PM] sundae383#0000
but idek what im doing with my own base let alone a sys wide infrastructure project


[07-Jul-24 07:05 PM] nyanism#0000
you missed the part why the project ended up being call 'kevin'


[07-Jul-24 07:06 PM] tanda#0000
oh that's a different "why is kevin"


[07-Jul-24 07:06 PM] sundae383#0000
also INS doesn't look very expensive?


[07-Jul-24 07:06 PM] tanda#0000
it adds up. For a full base you need roughly 5k INS to build, and then need more to maintain that base through repairs


[07-Jul-24 07:07 PM] sundae383#0000
makes sense


[07-Jul-24 07:07 PM] tanda#0000
so we're trying to target a price that would make it roughly 150k AIC cheaper in INS to build a full base


[07-Jul-24 07:10 PM] sundae383#0000
so like 30 AIC?


[07-Jul-24 07:11 PM] tanda#0000
yes


[07-Jul-24 07:12 PM] sundae383#0000
why is it called kevin?

aside from that, someone once mention 'kevin' could be a typo from 'kelvin' which would prolly fit well with INS project

that's what i had thought, but hal confirmed it was an intentional joke based off of "kelvin"


[17-Jul-24 11:45 AM] jvaler#0000
ummm okay, i'm getting around to the last of the server information overhaul and i'm realizing having our corp code be [CULT] instead of [ADI] is probably confusing

[17-Jul-24 11:46 AM] jvaler#0000
and we already built the corp HQ...


[17-Jul-24 11:46 AM] jvaler#0000
err i guess CULT is technically just a sub-faction of ADI after all


[17-Jul-24 11:46 AM] jvaler#0000
i could keep them separate and just make [ADI] a thing


[17-Jul-24 11:46 AM] akyantor#0000
For what it's worth I think they said in one of the patch notes they've made it possible to rename corps now

Ah, manually changed via molp


[17-Jul-24 11:48 AM] jvaler#0000

[17-Jul-24 11:48 AM] jvaler#0000
ohhh


[17-Jul-24 11:48 AM] akyantor#0000
Change of either name or code, like you can ask them to change your company name/code

shit i'mma go ask for that then


[17-Jul-24 11:49 AM] jvaler#0000
thx!


[17-Jul-24 11:49 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
What's the issue ? It's confusing to have multiple corp codes ?


[17-Jul-24 11:49 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah, i need a corp code to use for the bulletin post but having [CULT] be the company used by ADI would be confusing

{Reactions}
ü§£ 

[17-Jul-24 11:50 AM] jvaler#0000
cause it'd either be [CULT] or an imaginary [ADI] that doesn't exist ingame

wait this is ur corp i should ask you first lol


[17-Jul-24 11:51 AM] jvaler#0000
what do you think?


[17-Jul-24 11:51 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Could we make an ADI corp ? Just a second one


[17-Jul-24 11:51 AM] jvaler#0000
we could, but who would be in it


[17-Jul-24 11:51 AM] jvaler#0000
cause i'm in CULT for the elon HQ bonus


[17-Jul-24 11:52 AM] histidinedwarf#0000

[17-Jul-24 11:53 AM] jvaler#0000
alr i'll keep writing then


[17-Jul-24 11:54 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Just put "PS: The actual corp code for project purposes is [CULT]" somewhere


[17-Jul-24 11:55 AM] jvaler#0000
i imagine there's going to be more projects created by other people in the future, and those will have their own corps for HQ purposes


[17-Jul-24 11:55 AM] jvaler#0000
cause CULT is just 1 sub-faction. it just happens to be the only one at the moment


[17-Jul-24 11:55 AM] histidinedwarf#0000

would anyone be interested in starting a WCB manufacture project here in ADI? I think we could produce one WCB every 4 days with about 4 people

looks like you need about 16 ASM to feed one SKF making WCBs, divvied up on a few different Deimos bases, that's not so bad

I don't get why people hate multi permit bases


[02-Aug-24 11:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
There isn't that many planets that worth developing


[02-Aug-24 11:03 PM] tanda#0000
I think multi-permit bases have a niche, and it's early midgame


[02-Aug-24 11:03 PM] tanda#0000
when it costs more to get a ship than another level on your HQ


[02-Aug-24 11:04 PM] tanda#0000
that and let's be honest: 2.1k import a day? I'd just ask Avacyn to sell me FEO

I would love to know what buildings people have on planets so I can contact them and make a deal reducing logistics for both parties


[02-Aug-24 11:07 PM] tanda#0000
I can give you a rundown on mine if you want to take it down for notes:
Deimos: SME(AL), HWP(LHP), GF(GL)
Harmonia: GRN
Nascent: INC
ZV-194b: PP2(Bfab and LFab)
Nike: PP3(INS)
Elon: BMP, CHP(CL)


[02-Aug-24 11:08 PM] tanda#0000
wherever I can I source raw materials locally, I buy my ALO on Deimos, and I get my MGS on Elon and sell the bulk of my MG there

because realistically you're not going to use all that FE in ANT space

if i can get some grants to up my ALO and TIO production that would help immensely


[03-Aug-24 05:55 AM] avalock#0000
also to put out a project name before something like steve gets added to the mix
The Cargo Accessibility Program

a.k.a The CAP üß¢


[03-Aug-24 05:56 AM] avalock#0000
i was thinking Antares Cargo Accessibility Program but idk how ACAP would go with some people


[03-Aug-24 08:32 AM] razesdark#0000
My Deimos base is making enough TI and AL already to support 4 ASMs. I can make AST without importing, but the FE volume is so low importing that makes no difference either for me

[03-Aug-24 10:52 AM] tanda#0000
the only thing we'd need to source externally would be LFE I think


[03-Aug-24 11:05 AM] tanda#0000
Fair point, for 16 ASM total we'd only need something like 32 FE a day, so it might just be a "bring some iron ore to deimos occasionally" thing


[03-Aug-24 11:06 AM] tanda#0000
TI is a different matter though, and will need (at least for my setups) another base to smelt that


[03-Aug-24 11:07 AM] razesdark#0000
Avacyn is gracefully supplying about 50% og my TIO. I am looking into expanding myself, but logistics is slowly becoming a hassle

[03-Aug-24 09:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Buying extra MGS from CX or whatever is most convenient


[03-Aug-24 09:42 PM] tanda#0000
yes, the CHP on that base are fillers, I'll expand the BMPs as necessary

Alright, deal


[04-Aug-24 06:09 AM] razesdark#0000
Regarding the WCB project. 
How many do we actually need to produce a week? A single kit factory produces like 10 WCBs a week if we max it out. That sounds somewhat high to me. 
Can anyone make LFE's, which is also needed to upgrade starters to WCBs?


[04-Aug-24 11:49 AM] jvaler#0000
do we actually need more MGS?

@riseoffilth are you okay with me cutting into your CLI production to produce more MGS for PPP?


[04-Aug-24 11:50 AM] riseoffilth#0000
thats fine. We dont use that much CLI, so ive been generating quite the stockpile

I say nerf infinite storage and crush the market with a hammer


[04-Aug-24 12:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Idk if decreasing storage at ANT would help that. Then we'd have dedicated 3 permit STO bases on Heph to store what doesn't fit on ANT

üòÑ


[04-Aug-24 12:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You'd probably want dedicated R --> A-fab bases. Most of the demand, after a certain point, especially if you dump EDCs, in favor for IDCs, doesn't really touch R-fabs anymore, unless you do shipbuilding.


[04-Aug-24 12:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
My point is that I want active demand for every fab on the CX in the future


[04-Aug-24 12:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
So I assume everyone is fine with CX having no limit? If no I want to start a #NerfCXinfiniteStorage


[04-Aug-24 12:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Because that'd be fun


[04-Aug-24 12:29 PM] jvaler#0000
the problem with that is that there actually are some players that have hit the 500k CX WAR limit


[04-Aug-24 12:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You'll get more when your LUX coms, and more up-tiered projects start to creep, in general. I don't really keep up with them, though.


[04-Aug-24 12:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's always x3 more CXs in general jump range, x2 more if you're willing to go further out.


[04-Aug-24 12:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I just don't see how it hurts people. it's a bit silly to have people post above MM prices but it's not a massive problem


[04-Aug-24 12:30 PM] marat_sh#0000
Well they will have to sell their rocks for $0.01 for inflation in the market


[04-Aug-24 12:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
if it's for EDC/IDCs, those posts are just a market reserve, for dumping at other CXs for efficient FX transfer, in bulk.


[04-Aug-24 12:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Not many people know of those other things, but they're needed for the shiny things. Hard to get your hands on some of them.

[04-Aug-24 12:33 PM] riseoffilth#0000
to be clear, as I think you may not get that I'm completely kidding... everything I have or make, is for sale via my market page... which isnt in ADI (which I should copy over?)


[04-Aug-24 12:33 PM] riseoffilth#0000
all those items are hoarded for use and resale to anyone in here or my other friendly discord groups

I didnt meant I felt targeted, just want to make sure youdont get the wrong idea


[04-Aug-24 12:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I wouldn't call it "abuse". They're technically scraping margins. You need competition, to force them to offer better pricing.


[04-Aug-24 12:34 PM] riseoffilth#0000
"joking" is difficult to see across text


[04-Aug-24 12:34 PM] marat_sh#0000

[04-Aug-24 12:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
It‚Äôs have millions of tonnes of product sitting there and making players spend money to make bases for products that already in market


[04-Aug-24 12:35 PM] jvaler#0000
CX traders buying you out just to repost things 25% more expensive usually isn't "better pricing" imo


[04-Aug-24 12:35 PM] marat_sh#0000
I just took your rocks as example üòÖ sorry


[04-Aug-24 12:36 PM] marat_sh#0000
They could have been in someones factory


[04-Aug-24 12:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
When you get bought out, on a continual basis, for just getting reposted under someone elses account, now that's an issue. Especially when there's no more margin for competition to act on.


[04-Aug-24 12:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If it's a one time time, maybe stay in the 3 significant figure margin decriment, per new CX order?


[04-Aug-24 12:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's less easier for the competition to buy you out then.


[04-Aug-24 12:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And you basically force them to start lowering their prices, along with you.


[04-Aug-24 12:38 PM] marat_sh#0000
There is no competition when it doesn‚Äôt cost you anything to just wait until someones buys or makes a base to make it


[04-Aug-24 12:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
Just make people sale their product Nerfing storage helps with that


[04-Aug-24 12:39 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's always cost. I rarely buy-repost, unless it's necessary. I keep in-line with the current bulk of market competition.


[04-Aug-24 12:39 PM] marat_sh#0000
You, but not everyone


[04-Aug-24 12:39 PM] jvaler#0000
there was a PT scare a while back and i had started posting like 50/u lower than the last person to try and bring it back closer to normal, then a random trader bought it all and reposted it 50/u higher lol


[04-Aug-24 12:39 PM] riseoffilth#0000
yeah thats my biggest beef


[04-Aug-24 12:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
motherfuckers just buy and repost at higher prices


[04-Aug-24 12:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
compared to this... someone could always purchase shipments worth of something, at another CX, and get it shipped over, and dunk on your pricing, if there's a large enough inter-CX price spread ---- especially if they get it via BIDs.


[04-Aug-24 12:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
"Traders" are more often than not, market manipulators


[04-Aug-24 12:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@jvaler you were too low. Put it on the regular 2 sig fig price band.


[04-Aug-24 12:40 PM] jvaler#0000
wdym by that?


[04-Aug-24 12:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The prices can be brought down easily, within 1-2 weeks, if you stay in line.


[04-Aug-24 12:40 PM] riseoffilth#0000
according to who, who is the king of price setting?


[04-Aug-24 12:41 PM] jvaler#0000
700/u -> 650/u is within 2 sig figs

you cant have a healthy market where there is no regulation whatsoever in pricing without universal access to entry in a market


[04-Aug-24 12:41 PM] marat_sh#0000
Traders will have to use storage as well so they can‚Äôt just buy out whole market


[04-Aug-24 12:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
order updates are in 3 sig sigs.... Drop pricing too low, and someone may buy you out for price manipulation, or even better (stocking up on cheaper product).


[04-Aug-24 12:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or giving it to their friends? Idk.


[04-Aug-24 12:43 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, at a certain point the only way to stop it is to have enough production volume that you can keep reposting at your target price.


[04-Aug-24 12:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Competition on pricing is 1) Largely dependent on timezone activity of people, and 2)What they do. But giving significant discounts, just cuz you want your stuff sold faster, is just giving credits to those who can. There's certain rates for each COM.CX. Those reflect what's needed/sold on a usual basis, and dropping your price for like immediate sales, isn't likely to change the pricing spreads.


[04-Aug-24 12:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
Supply and demand should regulate prices


[04-Aug-24 12:44 PM] marat_sh#0000
Infinite storage creates fake supply


[04-Aug-24 12:45 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes it should, but when you have lots of spare liquidity, that is not being invested in anything ---- it makes cheap things rather attractive, no?


[04-Aug-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
Yes


[04-Aug-24 12:45 PM] marat_sh#0000
But can you hold all of the cheap stuff?


[04-Aug-24 12:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If they're prudent, they'll just keep their accounting logs/stock, until there is a serious bull market correction... Most aren't that strategic though.

[04-Aug-24 01:12 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That depends on what you do. BASICs are more preferenced for short trips from CX --> periphery planets. Their active bases can only deal with say x2 2kt/m3 FTLs for so long, after which they have to shut down (it not retaining the plot for the future). Pros are preferenced for yielding shipping to third parties, but with current plot creeps in the core worlds, it's harder for them to expand on their own... **However, I'm pointing out a discrete relationship, that can be taken advantage of, for more production overall**

So this got buried! Let me just dig it up again, lol.
I think we should probably aim to do KAWA's standard kit for the newer players as they join. MSL LFL LFE and WCB. All SKF recipes seem pretty straightforward, but for the life of me I have no idea how to even start with LFE production.
I think our target should be at least 2 a week, certainly not 10


[05-Aug-24 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
A base on Phobos


[05-Aug-24 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And I think I could help out with the ASM for the CTF


[05-Aug-24 02:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So a base with ECA and ELP could make CBL and  then LFE

i've got to the point where i'm shoving things into prunplanner


[05-Aug-24 02:15 PM] evany.#0000
but its challenging in ways i'm struggling with


[05-Aug-24 02:17 PM] evany.#0000
jvaler shared this website https://prosper.run/production-chains/WCB/1 where i put in all the components but this website doesn't say shit about how many asm's i need to keep a skf printing wcb's, so i've created like two spreadsheets and prunplanner to help me balance it


[05-Aug-24 02:18 PM] tanda#0000
my best guess was 16 ASMs to keep one SKF supplied before experts were involved


[05-Aug-24 02:21 PM] evany.#0000
thats like two bases of ASM


[05-Aug-24 02:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You can explore ASM | SKF routes through your own preferred way. But both ASM and SKF, have discrete cycle timers for their production. You can simplify their in-game timers, by converting the base cycle times, into a ratio of how many minutes are in a day [x / 1440]. You'll want enough ASMs to churn out 100 AST, and 100 FET, each time your SKF needs to cycle through.


[05-Aug-24 02:22 PM] evany.#0000
i imagine the way other people do it is they have a single or double SKF rolling through different components so they dont bottleneck on intermediate products


[05-Aug-24 02:22 PM] tanda#0000
that's why my first suggestion was have people run like 4 each on Deimos


[05-Aug-24 02:23 PM] tanda#0000
for WCB's I believe the actual problem is going to be TI


[05-Aug-24 02:23 PM] evany.#0000
my intention was kind of the same on deimos, but no new players can enter the project that way that didn't spawn deimos, so i was thinking i'd actually propose vulcan


[05-Aug-24 02:23 PM] evany.#0000
then we can have people opt-in


[05-Aug-24 02:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
They're both metallurgy industries, so COGCs don't matter, in that you're wanting to preference one planet or another. They do matter in that they will be boosting SKF outputs, which boost ASM outputs, which also boost how much you need to input into it all.


[05-Aug-24 02:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There is a POPI shift between them, so you could maybe come with a balance of not contributing some LUX goods, while contributing others.


[05-Aug-24 02:24 PM] evany.#0000
i dont care about cogc because im only concerned about finding the ratio as you alreayd pointed out


[05-Aug-24 02:24 PM] evany.#0000
cogc will be same so thus ratio will be the same


[05-Aug-24 02:24 PM] tanda#0000
main issue with using vulcan for ASMs is the POP just isn't there


[05-Aug-24 02:25 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Vulcan's POPRs are deflated, since they dont have enough POPI infrastructure, to supply current needs.


[05-Aug-24 02:25 PM] igfloz#0000
Is it worth bringing @scorpio089  into the conversation ?


[05-Aug-24 02:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I could maybe look at what Vulcan needs, on this weekend? I'm not on that planet yet, but I will be there in a handful of months, so it might be worth looking into.


[05-Aug-24 02:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It could be worth to bring your guy in, at least on the planetary COMG though. Although, just from a brief look, I get the inference that things are seriously under-built for POPR needs, since it's POPR satisfaction figures are deflated, well below 80%, and that there's T2+ POPI upkeep materials being donated, to maintained desired POPR rates. The population sums, are also kinda big --- quite a popular planet, but maybe you guys there should consider some additional SST | INF | PAR, since they're the cheapest to build + run.


[05-Aug-24 02:38 PM] evany.#0000
hadn't looked at popr


[05-Aug-24 02:42 PM] evany.#0000
solvable solution though since theres at least plots for people to open bases


[05-Aug-24 02:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The huge PIO #'s are cutting down on overall satisfaction rates, from the higher tiers. Basically everything needs upgrades, but you need to reference some stuff.


[05-Aug-24 02:43 PM] evany.#0000
asking people to tear down deimos bases to contribute to a group project that by definition will have poor returns seems not so great


[05-Aug-24 02:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah it's not the best idea, since Deimos is almost at the point of locking new bros out.


[05-Aug-24 02:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd recommend some good questions on Vulcan's COMG channel. If it's an issue for you, it needs to be addressed. I'm not there, so I can't pipe-in for you.

sounds like your already kind of taking it in the direction we would require though


[05-Aug-24 02:58 PM] scorpio089#0000
Just monitor the POPI to find a good time; Vulcan is historically a PIO planet and was run for it for more than a year. Higher workforce only came into play quite recently


[05-Aug-24 03:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
mm, people are looking to diversify, and they might be otherwise entangled, on other viable planets, through other commitments. It's only natural that this is happening now, on otherwise bespoke planets, free from the troubles of ENG + SCI. You'll just have to price them in, if they're going to stay there.


[05-Aug-24 03:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I mention pricing them in, since the immigration programs are extremely rough measures, that patch in small issues within POPR trends. They're also extremely expensive, increasing in cost with each tier you go up, and they do not scale with size. If there should be enough of a long-term demand for such population tier, then it's easier to let the weekly education turnovers to just keep rolling, and keep the POPI stuff set for such an intention.


[05-Aug-24 03:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
<-- done


[05-Aug-24 03:10 PM] scorpio089#0000

Infrastructure is looking good with the recent upgrades and i‚Äòll just do more if necessary


[05-Aug-24 03:19 PM] razesdark#0000
I think I calculated that my single 4 ASM setup (with experts) would pump out enough AST and FET to produce one WCB every 1.5 days. So just 5-6 should be enough for us to make two a week. I haven't done the math but adding a few more would probably also let us cover the fuel tanks


[05-Aug-24 03:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes. The discrete max-out LUX, experts, and COGC, infer 5 people running full, 1-permit ASM builds, and the 6th running a tiny little SKF allotment, of two such buildings, allowing you x4 WCB weekly? Cut that in half, and yeah you have a small working project.

[05-Aug-24 04:10 PM] razesdark#0000

[05-Aug-24 04:10 PM] razesdark#0000
I was mistaken, 4 ASMS


[05-Aug-24 04:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, TI per day is rough. A different idea: Batch production? Alternating SME's and ASMs via permit. Half do SMEs for whatever, for like 45 -> 90 days, then switch. If you don't have enough people, in this project, this can help you get some production, for what you want done. You'll basically just be #hot-potato 'ing your workforces to each other, until you can get more long-term commitments for it.


[05-Aug-24 04:19 PM] tanda#0000
It looks like we'd need around 145 TI/day


[05-Aug-24 04:19 PM] razesdark#0000
I think something as simple as 8-10 ASMS would be enough for the project.


[05-Aug-24 04:19 PM] tanda#0000
to keep one SKF running


[05-Aug-24 04:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, on the second though, this is not efficient. SMEs want PIOs, ASMs want mostly TECs, but also ENGs. You'll then have to revert lower tier habs, into higher habs, which on long-term bases never happens.


[05-Aug-24 04:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
On just an overview, of mine. You'd want 1/2 of your ASMs on Deimos, the other half on Vulcan, and your TI metal needs to come from somewhere else, on a first-pass (maybe Nike?)...


[05-Aug-24 04:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Transporting input materials, to another world, is inefficient, if you can instead couple them with current processes.


[05-Aug-24 04:23 PM] jcheung#0000
iirc a base with 7 ASMs needs almost a full SME base worth of TI in upkeep


[05-Aug-24 04:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hence, the issue.


[05-Aug-24 04:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Efficient TI production, exactly where you need it.


[05-Aug-24 04:25 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Deimos/Vulcan do the efficiency, and I'm pretty sure those ores + FLX + C can be imported without too much trouble, by anyone here, or with outsourcing...... But there's base costs with Vulcan, plot issues with Demios, and yeah, whatever else you can think about.


[05-Aug-24 04:26 PM] tanda#0000
there's some other smelting options in close proximity, but yes we're going to need a lot of smelters


[05-Aug-24 04:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A few jumps out from Deimos, +1 from Norwick, +2 is Nascent. Its your ALO hub. You can run very good smelting operations there, but you will need to import C/HCP + FLX + O + consumables. An option to consider.


[05-Aug-24 04:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Or just run these things on Hephaestus/Phobos.

Yeah.. not a fun challenge


[05-Aug-24 04:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Okay, a seperate idea.... Keep typing if you wanna finish your thoughts though...


[05-Aug-24 04:30 PM] jcheung#0000
you want to run metallurgy on manufacturing worlds? no.


[05-Aug-24 04:30 PM] jcheung#0000
that's about the stupidest thing


[05-Aug-24 04:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Would you have better SKF input requirements, in terms of what is needed daily, by running full ship requirements, instead of partial requirements. So WCB + MSL + MFL, instead of just pure WCB?


[05-Aug-24 04:31 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm a big fan of CoGC bonuses


[05-Aug-24 04:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just an idea. I'm not going to argue it.


[05-Aug-24 04:31 PM] tanda#0000
honestly yes, we're already pivoting to include the fuel tanks


[05-Aug-24 04:32 PM] tanda#0000

[05-Aug-24 04:35 PM] jcheung#0000
How many AML s do you need for the ZR


[05-Aug-24 04:35 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
uhm...


[05-Aug-24 04:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

I'm not scrolling right either, to proffer ppus for the outputs.


[05-Aug-24 04:38 PM] tanda#0000
you'd need 5 AMLs running full time to produce the amount of ZR that the sKF would need


[05-Aug-24 04:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ sounds about right.


[05-Aug-24 04:38 PM] tanda#0000
add in BE if we wanted to do LFE locally as well


[05-Aug-24 04:39 PM] jcheung#0000
Thanks tanda for the numbers.

5 * 2 [1 AML], and your MFLs get made cyclically @ 12 hours, plus everything else getting lobbed into the same ques....


[05-Aug-24 04:40 PM] jcheung#0000
Any grants going for this, or is it just straight repay by purchase


[05-Aug-24 04:40 PM] evany.#0000
haven't got to the funding portion yet


[05-Aug-24 04:41 PM] evany.#0000
we will see


[05-Aug-24 04:41 PM] evany.#0000
once we have a plan that makes sense then ill start poking people for funding


[05-Aug-24 04:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I wouldn't recommend grants... Straight repay is better. You can lob the AMLs under some CHEM COGC near you, for more revenue, if the prices that your guys offer, is too low. The backchain of inputs is also questionable, if you don't already do it.


[05-Aug-24 04:41 PM] jcheung#0000
Gotcha. I have a chem base i want to try to place in the near future, so i may be open to taking on some of the AML load.


[05-Aug-24 04:42 PM] jcheung#0000
I don't think you understand the conversation that's going on


[05-Aug-24 04:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
K. How you guys organize your stuff, is up to you, in your conversations.


[05-Aug-24 04:43 PM] evany.#0000

[05-Aug-24 04:44 PM] tanda#0000
remind me how experts are accrued? is it building number or area invested into an industry?


[05-Aug-24 04:44 PM] jcheung#0000
I would be swapping out POLs in the plan for AMLs


[05-Aug-24 04:44 PM] evany.#0000
building count per day of operation


[05-Aug-24 04:44 PM] razesdark#0000
I was thinking of expanding to KI to get more TIO, that base has abundant ZIR, and as luck would have it, I have space for 5 AMLs on a base close by with Chemistry COGC, I can potentially do that part too


[05-Aug-24 04:45 PM] evany.#0000
here let me open source the document


[05-Aug-24 04:45 PM] jcheung#0000

[05-Aug-24 04:50 PM] tanda#0000
my initial thought process was the same. If I ran ASM's for this project it would be on Deimos


[05-Aug-24 04:51 PM] evany.#0000
Ultimately it doesn't matter if you were to do it on another planet thats entirely up to you as long as it was delivered back to where it needed to be (Likely Vulcan, unless we ONLY have players sign up that are on Deimos, and people are willing to sacrifice parts of their existin gbases for the project)


[05-Aug-24 04:51 PM] evany.#0000
Or maybe they want to multipermit a bit for it- whatever the case is.


[05-Aug-24 04:52 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mm, know what you can get, in commitments. Then adjust.


[05-Aug-24 04:55 PM] razesdark#0000
I'm multi permitting it, and could fit an SKF if needed.


[05-Aug-24 04:56 PM] jcheung#0000
Are we building skf or are we using rise's 2?


[05-Aug-24 04:57 PM] razesdark#0000
I wouldn't mind using Rise's, if he has room in his production line for us


[05-Aug-24 04:58 PM] evany.#0000
SKF is such a minor part of the equation i'm not sure it matters


[05-Aug-24 04:58 PM] jcheung#0000
Fair


[05-Aug-24 04:58 PM] razesdark#0000
Probably not


[05-Aug-24 04:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't think the plan is to use the SKF full time ? That's a lot of WCBs


[05-Aug-24 05:00 PM] tanda#0000
if you divvy it up between MSL LFL and WCB it turns into about half a kit a day


[05-Aug-24 05:00 PM] evany.#0000
i mean, the kits through other people are weeks maybe a month long waiting list


[05-Aug-24 05:00 PM] evany.#0000
theres clearly demand, once we've satisfied internal demand i think we'd be happy to store a couple and then start selling kits outside


[05-Aug-24 05:00 PM] tanda#0000
it could even be used as an ADI recruiting tool


[05-Aug-24 05:00 PM] evany.#0000
slight changing of gears, but no reason to run it part time.


[05-Aug-24 05:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Is that the kit we're going with ?


[05-Aug-24 05:01 PM] evany.#0000
thats the meta-meta kit isn't it?


[05-Aug-24 05:02 PM] tanda#0000
well, I guess I didn't even think about that part of the discussion


[05-Aug-24 05:02 PM] tanda#0000
that's just the kit I got when I started out


[05-Aug-24 05:02 PM] evany.#0000
its what i was encouraged to buy, so i didnt put any thought into it and just assumed i'd build t hat


[05-Aug-24 05:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
meta's 2k t/m3 LCB/LSL/LFL with cheap AF engines. You guys are wanting to supply the starter-upgrade market, in shipbuilding offers.


[05-Aug-24 05:03 PM] jcheung#0000
Not for upgrades it isn't


[05-Aug-24 05:03 PM] evany.#0000
the target is #wkp-information


[05-Aug-24 05:03 PM] evany.#0000
we could theoretically pivot once established.. maybe ?


[05-Aug-24 05:03 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
bare bones, general... if you do more heavy t lifting, you will want the WCBs, and inversely.

[05-Aug-24 05:03 PM] evany.#0000
yeah


[05-Aug-24 05:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think the minimal WCB is more worth our time. Just the WCB + LFE + LHP


[05-Aug-24 05:04 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
in terms of cost? yes it is


[05-Aug-24 05:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah


[05-Aug-24 05:04 PM] evany.#0000
i haven't gone into LHP and SSC yet


[05-Aug-24 05:04 PM] evany.#0000
as other people here already make them


[05-Aug-24 05:04 PM] tanda#0000
LHP is easy, SSC a bit more complicated since its construction

Short tidbid ---- ill just type a sentence or two, from what I've seen.


[05-Aug-24 05:04 PM] evany.#0000
so my focus is on the modules


[05-Aug-24 05:05 PM] evany.#0000
now whether they can meet that demand i'm less sure of.


[05-Aug-24 05:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'll likely be adding a permit to Nike, I can put some SSC production there if it's enough


[05-Aug-24 05:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Many, if not most of the WCB - from starter offerings, on the UFO-Deals page, cut most people out from them. However, I'm pretty sure many would like to have brand new WCBs made, since they will be needing them to boost their in-game ideas.


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
This could be a viable market.


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] evany.#0000
if theres desire once kits are made then yes


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] evany.#0000
but i'd add non wkp ships to be all stretch goals


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Translation: allow >180d players to buy


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
?


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yes.


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But, I'm unlikely to convice those offering players, to do so.


[05-Aug-24 05:06 PM] evany.#0000
i see no need for the 180d requirement myself.

[05-Aug-24 05:07 PM] evany.#0000
if they are ADI they are priority, if they are outside they are sold a normal at profit wcb kit


[05-Aug-24 05:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Very unlikely, since those offerings are targeted not to gain money/revenues, but to ... how do you say it... convince newbros to stay in the game for longer?


[05-Aug-24 05:07 PM] jcheung#0000
We're not offering discount kits to the whole universe


[05-Aug-24 05:08 PM] jcheung#0000
Only adi


[05-Aug-24 05:08 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^just stating the <180d ads


[05-Aug-24 05:08 PM] evany.#0000
yeah outside adi we could figure out just tacking on 20% or something and sharing that


[05-Aug-24 05:08 PM] jcheung#0000
We can internally prioritize newer players if they show need


[05-Aug-24 05:08 PM] evany.#0000
infact others already do this.. no names


[05-Aug-24 05:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We can think about regular price later, how much more do we need to figure out before starting ?


[05-Aug-24 05:09 PM] jcheung#0000
No need for an arbitrary 180d limit since our pool is smaller


[05-Aug-24 05:09 PM] evany.#0000
i was working on it quietly a few hours ago but now i shared it kind of publicly


[05-Aug-24 05:09 PM] evany.#0000

[05-Aug-24 05:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'll offer a suggestion, not to be acted upon now, but it might come up later, with the resulting third party competiting. Run up figures for what you need, to do your production, per whatever ship you want to make, from the CX.AI1 figures. Then run seperate figures for your efficient, internal stuff.


[05-Aug-24 05:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
This will give you a good idea, of what you're up against, and give you enough for a sales pitch. Of course, internally preferenced... But you may expand later.


[05-Aug-24 05:11 PM] evany.#0000
we do that with every build


[05-Aug-24 05:11 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ k


[05-Aug-24 05:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
First let's decide the kits offered


[05-Aug-24 05:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think the minimal WCB one is the only vital one and if we have the SKF time we should also have an LCB


[05-Aug-24 05:14 PM] evany.#0000
same kit as #wkp, LFE WCB LFL MSL LHP SSC

[05-Aug-24 05:15 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe it's because I don't have the upgraded fuel storage, but I don't feel the need


[05-Aug-24 05:16 PM] tanda#0000
those upgraded fuel kits are extremely useful for things like the ~~INS project~~kevin


[05-Aug-24 05:16 PM] evany.#0000
its pretty marginal difference cost wise but huge quality of life imo


[05-Aug-24 05:16 PM] tanda#0000
can't actually make it to KI-401d and back without them


[05-Aug-24 05:16 PM] razesdark#0000
Its invaluable for me shuttling to and from KI for example.
I would use my entire FL fuel tank one way to get any sort of decent speed.


[05-Aug-24 05:17 PM] razesdark#0000
I would have to have 300 extra fuel in my cargo hold for the return trip


[05-Aug-24 05:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Fair, about how much does each tank add to the cost ?


[05-Aug-24 05:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The increased FTL tank sounds like a good idea but do you all feel the same about the SF tank ?


[05-Aug-24 05:18 PM] evany.#0000
its sold at 200k difference


[05-Aug-24 05:19 PM] evany.#0000
after ssc + LHP + wcb kit its 1.4m or 1.6mil for fuel kits


[05-Aug-24 05:19 PM] jcheung#0000
Do the tanks increase emitters?


[05-Aug-24 05:19 PM] evany.#0000
no


[05-Aug-24 05:19 PM] jcheung#0000
Neat


[05-Aug-24 05:21 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah it's not that much. We can leave an option for somebody to buy without the tanks but expect most to get it


[05-Aug-24 05:22 PM] evany.#0000
since wkp finances them with it included, yeah


[05-Aug-24 05:22 PM] evany.#0000
when i was new 100 days ago and asking about it i was told i'd be dumb not to get them


[05-Aug-24 05:22 PM] evany.#0000
and admittedly; i dont regret it for a second- huge quality of life increase i'm never worried about fuel anymore


[05-Aug-24 05:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@riseoffilth how much time of your SKF's can we borrow for WCB's


[05-Aug-24 05:23 PM] evany.#0000
current plan would use one indefinitely


[05-Aug-24 05:24 PM] evany.#0000
and they are cheap enough that it doesn't really matter does it ?


[05-Aug-24 05:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I just don't know if we are getting 1.5 new people buying WCB's every day


[05-Aug-24 05:24 PM] evany.#0000
well currently theres a backlog of about a month worth


[05-Aug-24 05:25 PM] razesdark#0000
It would only be 1/3rd of that if were doing fuel tanks as well


[05-Aug-24 05:25 PM] evany.#0000
jvaler wasn't happy with the existing delay and wanted to scrap the program


[05-Aug-24 05:25 PM] evany.#0000
instead of scrapping the program; i'd rather prop up the program by supplying the missing parts


[05-Aug-24 05:25 PM] evany.#0000
which is what led us here.


[05-Aug-24 05:27 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Yeah at the moment we could use the speed. We can also repurpose our bases to make other ship stuff once we are done with the backlog


[05-Aug-24 05:27 PM] evany.#0000
yep


[05-Aug-24 05:27 PM] evany.#0000
plus again.. the skf is cheap as shit


[05-Aug-24 05:27 PM] evany.#0000
1mil vs 10mil of aml's


[05-Aug-24 05:27 PM] evany.#0000
who really cares at that point.


[05-Aug-24 05:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well, less SKF = less AML needed


[05-Aug-24 05:28 PM] evany.#0000
oh if you were part time operation sure


[05-Aug-24 05:29 PM] evany.#0000
but if people are gonna drop bases for it


[05-Aug-24 05:29 PM] finestone#0000
do only new people buy WCBs? I assume as more players mature they want more ships what ships do more established people buy?


[05-Aug-24 05:29 PM] evany.#0000
older players need more than the kit finest one


[05-Aug-24 05:29 PM] evany.#0000
new players only need this 'kit'


[05-Aug-24 05:29 PM] evany.#0000
older players are much more complicated as they require the whole ship


[05-Aug-24 05:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
New players buy the WCB, from starter 500t/m3 ship upgrades. May not include MSL/MFL, or their larger variants.


[05-Aug-24 05:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Little note as well.


[05-Aug-24 05:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
There are others that make full ships but I don't think we are quite there yet, maybe in the future


[05-Aug-24 05:30 PM] evany.#0000
very distant future


[05-Aug-24 05:30 PM] evany.#0000
and maybe we can solve some bottlenecks for them


[05-Aug-24 05:30 PM] evany.#0000
its a good question though dvorak


[05-Aug-24 05:31 PM] finestone#0000
Understood i guess what parts do those use


[05-Aug-24 05:31 PM] evany.#0000
would a part time thing even work ? i don't know


[05-Aug-24 05:31 PM] evany.#0000
would people be interested in a part time ship building project?


[05-Aug-24 05:31 PM] evany.#0000
then it makes more sense to loan skf's and not drop bases etc


[05-Aug-24 05:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Your overall market, is basically anyone who does maintain long-term pro. This even includes anyone internally. BASIC players, degrading from limited pro, usually want to upgrade their starters, to max settings. Pros are depending on what they actually do. If you do alot of farming/general stuff, you want LCBs. If you do alot of metallurgy/con, you want WCBs. If you do alot of gas extraction, you want VCBs. Mixes are possible, with different playstyles.


[05-Aug-24 05:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Just general ideas. I'm very aware of the divergence of player needs, combined with actual t/m3 ratios offered with new ships, or upgrades.


[05-Aug-24 05:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Keep typing. I'll just add my own like, anecdote, IF i would like some ship, for some new project that I'd invest in.


[05-Aug-24 05:35 PM] jcheung#0000
we could probably sell any excess capacity to Rise


[05-Aug-24 05:35 PM] razesdark#0000
As far as the cargo bays are concerned, any configuration would be easy to supply IMO.

* VCB requiring only FET,
* WCB requiring 50% AST and 50% FET.
* LCB requiring only AST.

Given that the only difference between AST and FET is 1 AL or one FE per unit, while the 3 TI remains the same for both materials, it should be practically the same to produce any of them.
The crew quarters needed for LCB is something we can't supply tho


[05-Aug-24 05:36 PM] razesdark#0000
Large crew quarters*


[05-Aug-24 05:36 PM] evany.#0000
thanks for checking that Okawari!


[05-Aug-24 05:36 PM] jcheung#0000

WCB, basic fitting on left. LCB on middle. VCB on right. As a consumer, I have these basic needs. As a potential provider, how could y'all accomodate these production possibilities? Meet them? Be adaptible? Or just 1 of those products?

Yes, we can argue on the QCR FTL fittings. I wont.

MFK is trivial.

uncle leslie already makes, can ask if he's willing to make more perhaps?

mhm. Either way buying from CX wouldn't be so bad


[05-Aug-24 05:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ this is a valid concern.


[05-Aug-24 05:40 PM] jcheung#0000
it's a rounding error compared to the FET, yeah


[05-Aug-24 05:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Although, you need to verify it. The markets may correct.


[05-Aug-24 05:40 PM] evany.#0000
Yeah for completeness sake i've added the MFK / FS to the SKF base


[05-Aug-24 05:40 PM] evany.#0000
a single FS provides the necessary MFK


[05-Aug-24 05:41 PM] jcheung#0000
oh, wait, now that i look at it, he's out of MFKs


[05-Aug-24 05:41 PM] jcheung#0000

[05-Aug-24 05:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
ohh well


[05-Aug-24 05:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Story time. The markets used to supply all of your SFK + other ship building inputs, at like 1/3 --> 1/2 of the prices that you can see right now. We're in the middle of a huge shipbuilding market correction. Ships were cheaper like 1-2 years ago, literally straight from CX, into some bs final processes at Hephaestus or Nike, and out with a ship you went in a few days...


[05-Aug-24 05:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Things have changed though.


[05-Aug-24 05:43 PM] evany.#0000

regarding ASM bases assuming full base drops, if you split that up into a third base and do ASM/SME with SME doing the FE only, shipping in TI and FEO.... on, say.... vulcan so you could just have a 4th base mine the FEO for the others


[05-Aug-24 05:52 PM] jcheung#0000
as an option*

at least as linked


[05-Aug-24 05:59 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that was a lot to catch up on üòÖ fell out of the loop for a bit. just adding in: yes KAWA is happy to supply SSC and LHP for this if that makes all this planning simpler. I agree that it's probably best to aim for simpler kits, most people selling ones with fancy stuff are already making full ships and it's not hard to adjust. KAWA's kits do include the MFL though. Increased FF capacity allows for longer flights, like CX to CX, easier and I think that's worth considering. SF tanks are fine. I don't even buy full ships with bigger tanks any more. 1500 is like 4-5 flights


[05-Aug-24 05:59 PM] jcheung#0000

correction, WAL is accounted for in the alternate base design

eesh, according to that sheet the AML's are half the cost of the whole project


[05-Aug-24 06:41 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah. probably closer to a third after EXTs and more SMEs are added in

it may be time to create a new cult operations page so more important things can be pinned and discussed in there.


[05-Aug-24 06:59 PM] jcheung#0000
Well i assume that after we get the intial stuff hashed out it'll get its own channel like #ppp-information


[05-Aug-24 06:59 PM] tanda#0000

you can drop sub_stuff in a thread, in the same channel --- if you have the perms for it.


[05-Aug-24 07:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
can also pin that stuff, easily.

certainly seems simplest if nothing else


[05-Aug-24 07:45 PM] tanda#0000
I think so? it's only using part of a flx, part of a C, and part of an O

yes, that's what I meant as well


[05-Aug-24 07:50 PM] tanda#0000
it's just that by using preprocessed AL, it's only using 25% of C,O,FLX

you do have the added cost of the ALO, but it's nothing compared to C and O

People selling AML stuff rn that sound promising (idk if some of these are traders and don't own AML):
- [OOG] Hernanduer | KALL (selling ZR)
- [OOG] Interstellar Gaia (you know them) | INGA

I was going to keep going but I realized most of these are OOG


[05-Aug-24 08:58 PM] jcheung#0000
ugh. BER, BTS and LIO are going to suck a little bit... very low CX volume from what i can see, and the bases will have a lot of empty room...

@tanda I plan to expand into Antares. My Idea is a C and RAT production with HYF (Water I have) and INC/FP. Who can I talk, what the the antares development or CX need?


[10-Dec-24 09:29 AM] tanda#0000
Our projects here are targeted at bringing down the price on the CX. Either of the projects here would be a good contribution to ADI.


[10-Dec-24 09:29 AM] tanda#0000
If you're interested specifically in setting up that set of bases, I would highly recommend the Thalassa system for your expansion


[10-Dec-24 09:29 AM] tanda#0000
The system is tiny and has 3 planets (and a water tap) that match your plans

ty for reminding me


[19-Dec-24 08:49 AM] razesdark#0000
The price of H has been quite these last 6 months. We've gone from a steady price of 75-80 per unit this summer to, somewhere in the ballpark of 130AIC per unit.

H is kind of a pain to deal with, a base at KI-401d would require more than 1 2k2k ship to service it, since it takes about 1 day to get there from ANT.

I have been looking at IY-816h as a potential world to supply the CX and myself with H. Its closer to ANT, at about 13 hours each way. Making it possible to operate a full base with one dedicated 2k2k ship.

Yield is comparable to KI-401d, but it has quite high micrometeric density so ships kind of need to have STS in order to not get damaged severly when entering the system.

I'm wondering if other players here could be interested in trying to settle the planet and help to lower the price of H.


[19-Dec-24 08:59 AM] finestone#0000
I sell alot of the H for Cult atm and post for 100/u on elon


[19-Dec-24 09:00 AM] finestone#0000
the biggest issue with KI401d is the AR is very competivie so not everyone is there for the H


[19-Dec-24 09:00 AM] finestone#0000
I was personally looking at colonizing WU-882i for the H


[19-Dec-24 09:01 AM] finestone#0000
this would allow me to full AR on KI401d so yes I am interested in colonizing another H planet. The biggest issue for me is i will need another ship


[19-Dec-24 11:15 AM] razesdark#0000
```
| Planet  | Distance | Profitability | EFREQ 2k/2k | EFREQ 3k/1k | Base Price   |  
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| KI-401d | 1d3h     | 149,213.36    | 1.43        | 2.14        | 1,982,420.00 |
| IY-816h | 13h      | 140,272.87    | 1.49        | 2.24        | 2,406,680.00 |
| WU-882i | 1d6h     | 148,556.83    | 1.43        | 2.15        | 2,126,680.00 |
```


[19-Dec-24 11:23 AM] razesdark#0000
The shipping requirements is practically the only upside for IY as a base, really. I just compared all bases in Prunplanner. It seems somewhat doable to run a single 2k/2k. It gives you about 10 hours a day in leeway each day


[19-Dec-24 11:24 AM] finestone#0000
IY-816h requires BL tho yeah?


[19-Dec-24 11:25 AM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, seemingly it needs 4 of them for a full H base


[19-Dec-24 11:27 AM] finestone#0000
I show 36 BL


[19-Dec-24 11:27 AM] razesdark#0000
You're right, I didnt fill out the construction cart correctly


[19-Dec-24 11:28 AM] finestone#0000
all good so 2,4 M


[19-Dec-24 11:28 AM] finestone#0000
comapred to 2.1M so nothing too crazy IG


[19-Dec-24 11:30 AM] finestone#0000
I think either works I will say i usually ship H > Elon so WU882i was 2 jumps "less" compared to ANT


[19-Dec-24 11:31 AM] razesdark#0000
Right.
Both of the planets I have that require largeish amounts of H is Heph and Astraeus, which are both in the same system as ANT.


[19-Dec-24 11:33 AM] finestone#0000
IY816h also has a POPI down already


[19-Dec-24 11:33 AM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, but no pop buildings afaik


[19-Dec-24 11:33 AM] finestone#0000
not sure how much that saves but something


[19-Dec-24 11:33 AM] finestone#0000
would we COGC and admin?


[19-Dec-24 11:34 AM] razesdark#0000
COGC for sure. Not sure if you can collect taxes without admin.


[19-Dec-24 11:35 AM] finestone#0000
Well i would be down to help colonize but im a bit short on funds atm and need another ship Probably around a month or 2 for me


[19-Dec-24 11:35 AM] tanda#0000
You can't run Programs with out ADM that's for sure


[19-Dec-24 11:36 AM] tanda#0000
So getting pop might take a while


[19-Dec-24 11:38 AM] razesdark#0000
Yeah, good point.
I hoped we could drop a infirmary and security station and just happiness at 100%, but its probably worth it to get some programs running to increase worker count quickly.Since we won't get explorers grace for the first month either we probably need adm.


[19-Dec-24 11:42 AM] tanda#0000
Getting employment and safety/health fulfilment might be a really good start. I would definitely run the numbers through prunplanner or Archiel's spreadsheet


[19-Dec-24 11:58 AM] razesdark#0000
By the looks of it, a single SST should be enough to cap needs by quite the margin. As soon as we get a base down to soak up the unemployed there, happiness should be at 100% within a few weeks.


[19-Dec-24 11:59 AM] finestone#0000
Yeah i dont think you need programs for PIO


[19-Dec-24 12:01 PM] razesdark#0000
I think we're looking at an immigration of a few hundred PIOs a week at max happiness(not including the 200 for each base being put there).
So unless we run programs to recruit 500 extra workers a week, it might take a few month to get the two bases up and running

[23-Jan-25 05:59 PM] tanda#0000
HYFs produce 245 units/day of each ingredient. FP's consume 190.... Ah I see


[23-Jan-25 05:59 PM] tanda#0000
I meant to say it cannot supply 3 FPs


[23-Jan-25 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
i would say start with overproduction of h2o and dump the excess locally or on cx


[23-Jan-25 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
then overproduction on hyf, do the same


[23-Jan-25 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
or bank it


[23-Jan-25 06:01 PM] jcheung#0000
banking it would be the smarter thing, but may also be more difficult

AFAB only, and you'd need to swap places with an existing member if you want a share of it. expansion of the co-op has been considered, but it's too much hassle for the project lead to manage

[03-Feb-25 07:04 PM] tanda#0000
It's time for some ocCULT activity in ADI again.

Simply put, RAT prices are too high. I want to use the Thalassa system to help stabilize this market at least in ANT, if not in the whole universe. The project should focus on self-sufficiency, so we'll have a 3 stage rollout as we can get volunteers.

Basic structure of the project is as follows:
3 RIG (water producing) bases on Thalassa C
5 HYF (ALG/MAI/VEG production) bases on Thalassa B
7 FP (RAT production) bases on Thalassa A
2 CHP(13)/RIG(7) (NS production)bases on ZV-639d

Plan right now is to roll it out in the following three stages:

STAGE 1:
All RIG bases 

STAGE 2:
1 NS base
2 HYF bases
3 FP bases

STAGE 3:
1 NS Base
3 HYF bases
4 FP bases

Plan is for the following price points to let all parties have an opportunity to make money:
    H2O 35 
    NS  300
    ALG 275
    MAI 275
    VEG 275
Prices can be revisited as market conditions change, these price points keep all bases roughly profitable at 130/unit for RAT.

We are now looking for both volunteers, and a project name.


[03-Feb-25 07:21 PM] freeloader4#0000
I'd be happy to use a permit for a rig base, as I'm not too sure I could do complex things as I lack shipping capabilities. Only issue is it would likely take me a while to fully create the base as i only have around 500k

I'm giving strong consideration to dropping a RIG base myself as part of the project


[03-Feb-25 07:49 PM] tanda#0000
and pulling out of SE-110d


[03-Feb-25 07:50 PM] icooper#0000
Actually, I could possibly repurpose some infrastructure for this. Most of my profit comes out of thalassa right now. I have a 3 permit rig/DW base on C, and a single permit HYF on B. 
I am pretty much paid off on my loans and work IRL is super busy so having most of my activities contained to one system would help me with shipping and IRL time cost. I would need a couple weeks to get out from under my existing loans and make some money to repurpose off what I‚Äôm currently doing, but I have an enormous amount of H20 production capacity now, I‚Äôve just been turning it into DW at the point of extraction to lessen shipping needs.


[03-Feb-25 07:53 PM] icooper#0000
It is worth noting the building costs in thalassa are pretty high, so ROI is going to take a while for anyone considering getting into that system. It was probably a bit of a push to make those my 3rd-7th permits

true 

[03-Feb-25 08:01 PM] tanda#0000
I do want to point out for anyone thinking about dropping a RIG base due to needing water for their current empire, the number of HYF bases planned for this project will eat the entire output of 3 RIG bases. The vast majority of water will never leave the system

Is there any procedure to start a CULT project ?


[08-Feb-25 05:22 AM] laaxus#0000
The goal would be to reduce the cx Price of LFabs and RFabs to a reasonable level


[08-Feb-25 07:10 AM] laaxus#0000
# Summary

The reason I started this project is that I believe fabs are too expensive on the market, limiting the growth of every Antarean‚Äîsomething I find entirely unacceptable.
Faster growth benefits everyone, especially newer players.

Another benefit is that, with lower fabs price, every base becomes more profitable.

1. The goal is to increase fab production to lower their CX price.
2. The project improves efficiency by coordinating the production of fabs and input goods.
3. All transactions are conducted on the CX, except for local transfers (e.g., CL ‚Üí EPO on Origon).

To that end, I will support the development of two relatively new construction planets: ZV-759a and Kevin.
However, any participant should start by establishing their base on Nike and Aceland.
# Future part of the program if it gains traction
1. Leased base program
2. Input goods price stabilization (Other than epo)
3. AFabs production

# Price reduction 

The first price goal is the following
PP2 (LFABS) at roughly 16d roi (70k profit/d)
PP3 (RFABS) at roughly 17d roi (125k profit/d)

TICKER : Current ASK -> Current goal (%reduction)

LBH : 4300 -> 3800 (13%)
LDE : 9480 -> 8200 (15.6%)
LSE : 9280 -> 8400 (10%)
LTA : 4250 -> 3400 (25%)

RBH : 18600 -> 17000 (9%)
RDE : 31500 -> 30000 (5%)
RSE : 27500 -> 25000 (10%)
RTA : 21500 -> 18000 (20%)

EPO : 189 -> 170

# Planet development

To be done with tanda

# How to participate

Build one of the following base and tell us in the chat

On Nike Aceland 
PP2 base (LFABS): 
PP3 base (RFABS): 

On Origo, Electronica, Griffonstone, Ki-840c

[08-Feb-25 07:38 AM] razesdark#0000
Cool! I'm making a little bit of EPO I can sell to the project for the target price if you want.
I'm building a few low-maintenance cost bases on planets with HAL and produce CL locally to decrease the logistical burden, so the output isn't fantastic tho


[08-Feb-25 07:43 AM] laaxus#0000
All sales will be on the cx


[08-Feb-25 07:44 AM] laaxus#0000

[08-Feb-25 09:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm currently producing some lfabs myself and am willing to reduce my prices to be in line with this project.


[08-Feb-25 09:13 AM] jcheung#0000
I think you might want to add in AL production as that'll be a heavy, expensive input


[08-Feb-25 09:32 AM] laaxus#0000
you don't need to reduce your price
as long as you continue to produce and sell on the cx, then you're doing your part


[08-Feb-25 10:26 AM] razenpok#0000
I'll join in with RDE. I produce 6.5/d, which should cover current CX demand


[08-Feb-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I think lower RFabs price will increase demand but every contribution is welcome


[08-Feb-25 10:33 AM] razenpok#0000

[08-Feb-25 01:36 PM] tanda#0000
Looks like a solid start. jcheung is right, though. Any construction project targeting these goods is going to increase AL and STL prices on the CX. (I don't think this is a bad thing, a base of SME only makes 66k doing AL right now)


[08-Feb-25 01:38 PM] laaxus#0000
This is also why I want to make every transaction on the CX


[08-Feb-25 01:38 PM] laaxus#0000
so that the rest of the antares also indirectly participates


[08-Feb-25 01:39 PM] laaxus#0000
if the price of AL and STL increases, the production should increase


[08-Feb-25 01:44 PM] jcheung#0000
It's going to be logistical hell to haul stl and al to cx only to haul it out to the construction planet


[08-Feb-25 01:45 PM] laaxus#0000
not really


[08-Feb-25 01:45 PM] laaxus#0000
not every construction planets are close to deimos


[08-Feb-25 01:46 PM] laaxus#0000
and not every recipe requires as much AL


[08-Feb-25 01:46 PM] laaxus#0000
ok nvm only LTA requires 1 AL


[08-Feb-25 01:47 PM] laaxus#0000
Furthermore


[08-Feb-25 01:47 PM] laaxus#0000
As long as the CX price represent the real current price


[08-Feb-25 01:48 PM] laaxus#0000
then it doesn't really matter if a few AL are being bought on Deimos


[08-Feb-25 01:49 PM] laaxus#0000
ok I just looked it up, I might have underestimated the shipping requirements for a PP2 base

[08-Feb-25 02:05 PM] .shiva.#0000
But tbh, it won't take that much to crash lfab prices


[08-Feb-25 02:08 PM] .shiva.#0000
But imo LTA @3400 isn't a reasonable target and wouldn't be worth bothering with at the price


[08-Feb-25 02:09 PM] laaxus#0000
If it doesn't take that much, let's see how the market react with that initial push


[08-Feb-25 02:10 PM] laaxus#0000

[08-Feb-25 02:13 PM] laaxus#0000
Then I'll do it myself

[08-Feb-25 02:16 PM] laaxus#0000
Anyway the point has Always been about increasing production


[08-Feb-25 02:16 PM] laaxus#0000
It's fine if you don't want to sell at Price I put above


[08-Feb-25 02:23 PM] laaxus#0000
let's not forget I presented a DRAFT


[08-Feb-25 02:23 PM] laaxus#0000
hence why I'm seeking feedback ^^


[08-Feb-25 02:26 PM] laaxus#0000
Ok so my current (personal) plan is


[08-Feb-25 02:26 PM] laaxus#0000
already built :
PP3 : Nike Aceland Kevin


[08-Feb-25 02:27 PM] jcheung#0000
kevin is also quite far out if you intend to hit CX for everything


[08-Feb-25 02:28 PM] jcheung#0000
you'll probably need a WCB on that route and nothing else


[08-Feb-25 02:28 PM] laaxus#0000
Plan to build :
PP2 : ZV-759a, ZV-194b, maybe hekaton


[08-Feb-25 02:28 PM] laaxus#0000
on kevin, I'm building RTA which has low shipping requirements


[08-Feb-25 02:29 PM] laaxus#0000
and yes, I'll have to buy a WCB for that project, just to transport the AL


[08-Feb-25 02:29 PM] laaxus#0000
Worth it tho


[08-Feb-25 02:32 PM] laaxus#0000
you know what ?


[08-Feb-25 02:32 PM] laaxus#0000
let's wait I built all those bases


[08-Feb-25 02:33 PM] laaxus#0000
and that prices stabilized


[08-Feb-25 03:00 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If nothing much has changed, EPO is probably a comparably simpler and immediately profitable start for the project. Also the Aurum (thank molp new name) HQ is still there

[08-Feb-25 03:03 PM] laaxus#0000
A stable supply of EPO would be a great start indeed


[08-Feb-25 03:04 PM] tanda#0000
I do like the idea of planetary development being a CULT project as well (not least because that's slowly starting to be part of my focus), but that might be best split off from a production project


[08-Feb-25 03:06 PM] laaxus#0000
Infrastructure development benefit every player in antares, even those not part of the adi


[08-Feb-25 03:07 PM] tanda#0000
agreed, but lumping it in with a project focusing on production (and focusing on bases on planets that aren't even those being developed) feels clunky


[08-Feb-25 03:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
This is where the worst guy you know runs out of the bushes to yell "FREE RIDER PROBLEM" and stop there, glad we have collective-minded folk here

hah. I'm a fan of the "develop the real estate and then the tax payers will show up" line of thinking


[09-Feb-25 02:33 AM] laaxus#0000
I had an Idea while sleeping


[09-Feb-25 02:34 AM] laaxus#0000
What if, when new players join the adi


[09-Feb-25 02:35 AM] laaxus#0000
We suggest we upgrade both their ships for free


[09-Feb-25 02:35 AM] laaxus#0000
And in exchange, one of the two WCB do AL shipping for a Month (fuel and repair on us)


[09-Feb-25 02:36 AM] laaxus#0000
Mmmmm


[09-Feb-25 02:37 AM] laaxus#0000
Nah, might as well buy the ships myself, not economically worth it after 3 Month ...


[09-Feb-25 06:56 AM] laaxus#0000
Ok so now I'm kinda decided on splitting this project in 3 branches :
1) RFabs
2) LFabs
3) Planetary infrastructure


[09-Feb-25 06:56 AM] laaxus#0000
I was thinking on starting with RFabs (and EPO production)


[09-Feb-25 06:57 AM] laaxus#0000
but there are not enough LBH on the market to do more than 3 Pol bases


[09-Feb-25 06:57 AM] laaxus#0000
so I guess I'll start with Step 2


[09-Feb-25 10:07 AM] evany.#0000
If you need lfabs let me know I only have a few hundred of each but should be sufficient for a lot of things


[09-Feb-25 10:08 AM] evany.#0000
I only have a few rfabs being produced but it‚Äôs work in progress as well


[09-Feb-25 10:11 AM] laaxus#0000
It's ok, I have 2 PP2 bases gearing up


[09-Feb-25 10:12 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm thinking of selling a POL base package


[10-Feb-25 01:41 PM] razesdark#0000
No one would happen to have like 20 MGC (not to be confused with MCG)?


[13-Feb-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
@realharvey single handedly saved my finance


[13-Feb-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000

[13-Feb-25 11:01 AM] realharvey#0000
Whoopsi


[13-Feb-25 11:01 AM] realharvey#0000
I'd did buy RSE and TI


[13-Feb-25 11:01 AM] realharvey#0000
Which one was it? üòÇ


[13-Feb-25 11:01 AM] laaxus#0000
RSE


[13-Feb-25 11:02 AM] laaxus#0000
as part of this project


[13-Feb-25 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm overextending a bit


[13-Feb-25 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
so my finance are tight, as RFabs are less liquid


[13-Feb-25 11:03 AM] realharvey#0000
yeah there is not that much Demand for fabs. I way oversupplied ANT with 3 LFab bases in the past


[14-Feb-25 11:16 PM] jcheung#0000

That might be the origin


[13-Apr-25 10:02 AM] evany.#0000
either way cults just a boost to chem products on elon, not much more than that.


[13-Apr-25 12:30 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Cause we started with PPP


[13-Apr-25 12:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
A while ago people felt like making an ADI corp


[13-Apr-25 12:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
There was a few different ideas


[13-Apr-25 12:49 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Antares Prosperity Union was a popular one and people also wanted a CULT code because it was free


[13-Apr-25 12:49 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We thought it'd be funny to have an unrelated code and so I took the CULT code until we had a purpose for it


[13-Apr-25 12:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Which was PPP


[13-Apr-25 12:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
How I recall it
