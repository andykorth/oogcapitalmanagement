ayoooo!! it's spreadsheet time!


[03-Jun-24 01:17 PM] acramernc#0000
okay so what would the goal of an administrative sheet be? are we looking to condense corporation production into a single view of sorts, or do you want to be able to set production goals and know what is necessary


[03-Jun-24 01:20 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
my personal goal is a sheet that calculates what I need on each planet using a combination of burn math and manually set thresholds, then I can just select a planet from a dropdown and it will tell me what to export and what to import. The goal is when a ship arrives on a planet I don't even need to think, just open the load/unload view and do what it says. That way I don't have to research my whole company every time a ship lands somewhere...


[03-Jun-24 01:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but I think an 'administrative sheet' for this project, I imagine just a condensed list of all the tools people have made or are working on, as well as some standards to use when making tools collaboratively. Like "name the sheet that pulls CX data this" or "refer to this formula output as this to avoid confusion with that" ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[03-Jun-24 01:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
then a bunch of data sheets already set up for actively experimenting with tools easily


[03-Jun-24 01:25 PM] acramernc#0000
I've heard this sentiment a bunch of different places, particularly the tracking of what to import / export. I'm not far enough into the game yet to really understand this need, so let me ask this: what are you looking for that is distinct from the use of an XIT BURN screen


[03-Jun-24 01:26 PM] lossi#0000
I would like to see less demand for so many sheets, especially when as noted, they often draw the same data, and more accurate sheets could make use of fewer calls to the API and update information in multiple sheets

[03-Jun-24 01:26 PM] lossi#0000
One of the biggest complaints I get from people is that the in-game UI is too hard to understand, and I think a centralization of sheet tools could supplement this and help new players.

[03-Jun-24 01:27 PM] lossi#0000
XIT doesn't do much in the way of telling you how to balance out your network


[03-Jun-24 01:27 PM] lossi#0000
Burn just tells you where things are and where they're needed in an isolated way


[03-Jun-24 01:29 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
a) some materials are not included in burn but I still like to keep a specific amount of those things on a planet. Like fuel stockpiles, or things I sell there.
b) burn tells only what I need to deliver, not what I need to export
c) XIT burn doesn't really help with bigger picture planning. I would like to be able to manually enter shipping routes, then the sheet uses that to tell me what to load and unload for future stops.

I absolutely love XIT burn and use it *a lot*, but there are some limitations, and once you start having more bases it can get tedious to keep up with everything and I don't always have the time


[03-Jun-24 01:29 PM] lossi#0000
C is rather adjacent to one of the things I'm working on


[03-Jun-24 01:29 PM] lossi#0000
my focus in the game has been that little to almost no care is given to the logisitics organization


[03-Jun-24 01:30 PM] lossi#0000
People just...  Build a new ship

🚀 

[03-Jun-24 01:30 PM] lossi#0000
Or increase fuel use


[03-Jun-24 01:35 PM] lossi#0000
Take a theoretical player that has the entire strip from benten as their bases.  You can easily split it into smaller ships the further out you go instead of just utilizing a massive expensive WCB fully decked out ship

[03-Jun-24 01:38 PM] lossi#0000
That's an entirely theoretical layout for a route, I'm in the nightmare that is Moria logistics


[03-Jun-24 01:38 PM] lossi#0000
but benten looked easier to make an example from


[03-Jun-24 01:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also worth noting that there are a handful of connections that aren't on that map


[03-Jun-24 01:39 PM] acramernc#0000
```
Planet |    <Enhanced Burn Tickers>    | <Additional Manual Tickers>
-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------
       |               <Fio Storage Data for Ticker> 
-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------
       |         <Min Required stockpile (manually entered)>
-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------
       |                  <Calculated import/export>
```


[03-Jun-24 01:42 PM] acramernc#0000
okay so i think this table would get a and b, still need to think about c


[03-Jun-24 01:43 PM] lossi#0000
C is easier than you may think


[03-Jun-24 01:43 PM] acramernc#0000
could potentially add special characters to the stockpile to indicate a set # of days of burn instead of a static number


[03-Jun-24 01:45 PM] acramernc#0000
tbh i think c isn't reaching as high as it could, why manually set your own shipping routes when you could have an algorithm set them for you


[03-Jun-24 01:46 PM] acramernc#0000
but that is reaching well into the realm of a full blown website instead of a sheet


[03-Jun-24 01:46 PM] lossi#0000
Would it be necessary though?


[03-Jun-24 01:46 PM] lossi#0000
Or helpful?


[03-Jun-24 01:47 PM] acramernc#0000
is any of this necessary?


[03-Jun-24 01:47 PM] lossi#0000
The algorithm I mean


[03-Jun-24 01:48 PM] acramernc#0000
i think that may depend on the person, i much prefer the idea of inserting my bases and ships into an algorithm and having it figure out the optimal routing, but i'm sure there are many people who would like to make their own routes


[03-Jun-24 01:50 PM] lossi#0000
I'm weary to consider an algorithmic solution, admittedly.  You can in theory give chatgpt an explanation of the data with the CSV's from fnar and it could build a network for you


[03-Jun-24 01:51 PM] lossi#0000
But you wouldn't understand the underlying results


[03-Jun-24 01:51 PM] lossi#0000
Having worked as a PA at amazon long enough I've seen the consequences of automation for the sake of automation


[03-Jun-24 01:52 PM] acramernc#0000
chatgpt is not a good tool for algorithmic problems


[03-Jun-24 01:52 PM] lossi#0000
You generate a culture of people who don't actually understand or understand how to obtain the information they're playing with.


[03-Jun-24 01:53 PM] lossi#0000
And then a small group of people hold way too much knowledge that hinders the entire community when they leave and their tools are left barren


[03-Jun-24 01:53 PM] lossi#0000
It's not perfect, but admittedly for the simplicity of this question it could do it just fine


[03-Jun-24 01:54 PM] lossi#0000
1 build routes between planets
2 establish the flow rates
3 identify locations where large sums of goods can transfer and set up warehouses there
4 buy ships to transfer to the warehouse hubs and back


[03-Jun-24 01:57 PM] acramernc#0000
regardless, i don't think this particular feature would be appropriate for a spreadsheet anyways


[03-Jun-24 01:59 PM] acramernc#0000
my brain loves the complexity of the potential heuristic of the a* algorithm and all the weights you could apply, but there is no way to program that within a sheet and i want to avoid appscripts if at all possible


[03-Jun-24 01:59 PM] lossi#0000

[03-Jun-24 01:59 PM] lossi#0000
Anyone wanna make a spread on gsheet for us


[03-Jun-24 02:00 PM] lossi#0000
Recommend editors use their emails and let other people make copies

[03-Jun-24 02:07 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
either of you want to take lead here? I've been playing PrUn a bit and have some ideas that might help guide development, but not nearly the technical knowledge you seem to have. I'll play 'product owner' if you wanna decide *how* to do things. I feel like you have an idea in mind for organizing this based on experience, and I'm more interested in learning from that than stepping on toes with my own totally inexperienced and ill-informed ideas, lol


[03-Jun-24 02:07 PM] lossi#0000
*looks at the organization of my sheets*


[03-Jun-24 02:08 PM] acramernc#0000

i desperately wish gsheets would let you make sheet folders lol

The bottom right black thing should be in a sheet of its own since it calculates the best things to buy in arbitration


[03-Jun-24 02:10 PM] lossi#0000
has nothing to actually do with fuel cost


[03-Jun-24 02:10 PM] acramernc#0000

[01-Jul-24 12:01 PM] avalock#0000
i’m guessing automation might be cheaty, if its possible to grab timers on ships from the game, maybe a lil alarm clock thing


[01-Jul-24 12:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah


[01-Jul-24 12:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I’m pretty sure those are against the ToS


[01-Jul-24 12:02 PM] avalock#0000
the alarm clock or automation


[01-Jul-24 12:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Definitely the alarm clock

well i guess non game stuff then lmao

I believe FIO was updating endpoints


[01-Jul-24 12:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe it will have some cool new functionality you can use


[01-Jul-24 12:06 PM] avalock#0000
yeeee i’ll look around FIO


[01-Jul-24 12:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Oh, you could have a thing live-updating all LM contracts available


[01-Jul-24 12:07 PM] avalock#0000
ooooo that would go hard


[01-Jul-24 12:08 PM] avalock#0000
maybe a lil like… compare LM to CX prices

*cracks fingers*

i needed a python project anyways


[01-Jul-24 12:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
With enough free time you could have a thing telling you if there's a convenient shipping path between multiple planets to collect a bunch of orders


[01-Jul-24 12:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
FIO has a path finding endpoint


[01-Jul-24 12:09 PM] avalock#0000
oo


[01-Jul-24 12:11 PM] avalock#0000

its definitely better albeit less useful than prunplanners


[18-Jul-24 05:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I happen to be in the figurative business of galaxy generation algorithms so I took a look at PRuN and FIO. Apparently all the systems have 3D coordinates


[18-Jul-24 05:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Would be neat to see a full 3D map if that's not a thing yet


[18-Jul-24 05:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Like 15% I'll try it


[18-Jul-24 05:53 PM] jcheung#0000
I did notice they were 3d as i was moving around the map ingame... some lines overlap in the default view angle and make it a pita to view


[18-Jul-24 05:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Oh yeah you can move the camera a bit


[18-Jul-24 05:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

Maybe exaggerate the Z position more and give more camera freedom


[18-Jul-24 05:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And give the CX systems a different 3D model

i'd also be curious as to what time is like 'the ideal time' to launch ships are they on daily cycles etc


[19-Jul-24 12:40 AM] evany.#0000
physics in general make very little sense seemingly.. ill launch two ships to the same target station but two hours apart and frequently have the 2nd ship arriving as much as 5 hours earlier which is crazy to me.


[19-Jul-24 12:48 AM] jcheung#0000
Or I'll add one unit of fuel allocation and it adds 8 hours to the flight time


[19-Jul-24 12:48 AM] jcheung#0000
By one unit, i mean literally one SF

Oh, sorry. 6 hours

Hello, I’m interested in creating (or help creating) a shipping tool for the game. I am new player, but my background is in computational physics, so this is really compelling subject for me.

As far as I know, I don’t think there’s a published formula for fuel usage. I was wondering if anybody had tried logging differing fuel usage vs the live orbit map inside the game?


[24-Jul-24 02:16 AM] razenpok#0000
Not sure if anyone here has tried that, but you might find helpful the planetary data from the game available at https://rest.fnar.net/planet/allplanets/full (the response is huge, and API might be slow to return a response; I'll attach the most recent one to this message). Look for:

its actually an interesting question to ask too, so you can see exactly what/how long something should take

would help tackle the issue of "is 6hours good for this route?" only to get only 8 hours and spend 3 minutes dragging around trying to get back to 6 hours


[24-Jul-24 04:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
There's been a few people discussing this in the past.


[24-Jul-24 04:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
If I recall somebody had a working prototype of a shipping calculator that had somewhat accurate predictions of flight characteristics between one planet to another.


[24-Jul-24 07:20 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
MemoryAlpha is probably the person who's done the most work in flight stuff. Check out the stl flight discussion channel here for most of the community research so far https://discord.com/invite/m3NVRpFF


[24-Jul-24 10:20 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
anyone have an CX arbitrage tool they'd be willing to use to help me in exchange for a cut of profit? I've got a ship about to fly HRT to BEN and I know there's got to be some good trades there, but I don't personally have a tool for finding them because I don't do CX trading a lot


[25-Jul-24 05:14 AM] razenpok#0000
I've made an extension over https://rest.fnar.net/exchange/all here:

> https://refined-prun.github.io/refined-prices/all.csv

Information is updated during the day from https://rest.fnar.net/exchange/all and https://rest.fnar.net/exchange/cxpc/, with added fields for each ticker:
- FullTicker
- OpenYesterday
- CloseYesterday
- HighYesterday
- LowYesterday
- TradedYesterday
- TWAP7D
- VWAP7D
- Traded7D
- AverageTraded7D
- TWAP30D
- VWAP30D
- Traded30D
- AverageTraded30D

VWAP: Volume-Weighted Average Price
TWAP: Time-Weighted Average Price
VWAP7D and VWAP30D are like PP7D and PP30D in prunplanner (idk what they really use) in a way that it's a more stable price than ask/buy/average. TWAPs are added just in case.
AverageTraded helps to estimate the average daily supply/demand for a commodity when trades are infrequent:
AverageTraded7D = Traded7D / 7
AverageTraded30D = Traded30D / 30


[25-Jul-24 05:15 AM] razenpok#0000
Ah, and there's probably less chance to get N/A in Google Sheets than when using FIO API, since it is statically served by GitHub Pages


[25-Jul-24 05:15 AM] razenpok#0000
FIO API has more recent data though


[25-Jul-24 05:29 AM] evany.#0000
daily ?


[25-Jul-24 05:39 AM] razenpok#0000
Every half-hour a script runs, updates all fields from https://rest.fnar.net/exchange/all, and then for each ticker that was updated more than a day ago, it goes to https://rest.fnar.net/exchange/cxpc/ticker and updates the added fields up until it gets rate limited by FIO API


[25-Jul-24 06:11 AM] evany.#0000
not concerned about getting rate limited on the same items every time ?


[25-Jul-24 06:14 AM] evany.#0000

Well, there are 2000 tickers,  the script runs 48 times a day, and it takes some 60 requests to get rate limited

I think it should work fine

yeah thats fair. probably a sort so that you target oldest/expired data most often for updates would ensure things don't get missed i suppose

[03-Aug-24 12:29 PM] evany.#0000
the only thing is i didn't find a good way to handle 'current level'  because if you are 7 and you put in 7 then it will count the materials you are on, so you have to put in 8 to skip your current levels materials


[03-Aug-24 12:29 PM] evany.#0000
couldn't really think of a good way to handle that situation without putting 'caps' on it


[03-Aug-24 12:30 PM] tanda#0000
that's pretty easy to just explain how to use it on the sheet itself


[03-Aug-24 12:30 PM] evany.#0000
yeah i tried to - i'm certainly open to other suggestions to make things more clean


[03-Aug-24 12:33 PM] tanda#0000
~~It does look like it's not counting some materials going above level 10 (like AAR) but even just having a quick sum sheet for up to level 10 is great~~ Nope I see it now


[03-Aug-24 12:34 PM] evany.#0000
was gonna say. hqclean should have everything 1-50


[03-Aug-24 12:35 PM] evany.#0000

[03-Aug-24 04:16 PM] evany.#0000
okay i made that change, but it has the side effect of reversing now so you can put in hq lvl 7 and target level 5 and it will tell you how many parts to downgrade which i dont like.. but since you can't downgrade i will leave it


[03-Aug-24 04:16 PM] evany.#0000
thanks for the feedback


[03-Aug-24 04:26 PM] jcheung#0000

Hi peeps, is there a way to 'force' PRUNplanner inventory updates? I can see FIO is relatively quick but PRUNplanner saves on API calls by reducing calls to (at least) an hour. I understand if it's intentionally and cannot be changed.


[13-Aug-24 02:42 PM] realharvey#0000
Just force the update

[23-Aug-24 06:16 AM] jvaler#0000
but question for people with listings, how important is your inventory and burn privacy to you?


[23-Aug-24 06:17 AM] jvaler#0000
i'm wondering if i should filter down your outputs to only the items and locations specified by the settings, or if it should export your entire inventory and burn outputs


[23-Aug-24 06:23 AM] jvaler#0000
filtering your outputs would make it so anything you don't have listed will stay private, but it could also possibly prevent certain features being made in the mastersheet in the future


[23-Aug-24 06:24 AM] jvaler#0000
said features wouldn't be that important imo though


[23-Aug-24 06:37 AM] tanda#0000
It's just a game, specifically a game where subterfuge isn't really a thing. I don't really need privacy for my space bits and bytes


[23-Aug-24 07:02 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, not really bothered about sharing burn rate. I think most people looking at the internal market just want to know what they can buy somewhat immediately.


[23-Aug-24 07:03 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd probably only share my available stock to buy, price, and location (if we offer more than one).


[23-Aug-24 07:05 AM] sidepipe#0000
I would personally want my unlisted inventory private, but that’s just because I run a few bases for other people where I don’t want to share the inventory


[23-Aug-24 07:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
Burn rate is fine! I had that in my own listings, I just never updated it 😁


[23-Aug-24 07:06 AM] laaxus#0000
how would that spreadsheet work ?


[23-Aug-24 07:07 AM] laaxus#0000
everybody would have access ?


[23-Aug-24 07:17 AM] jvaler#0000
not bothered as in fine to do so or as in don't want to?


[23-Aug-24 07:17 AM] jvaler#0000
i'd like to structure it assuming i have burn data


[23-Aug-24 07:18 AM] jvaler#0000
cause it's useful for people to have a reference of scale on how much they're buying relative to your production


[23-Aug-24 07:19 AM] jvaler#0000
this way people don't feel like they're too burdensome. i had at least one anecdote of someone feeling that way iirc


[23-Aug-24 07:19 AM] jvaler#0000
noted


[23-Aug-24 07:19 AM] jvaler#0000
thinking i'm gonna only send filtered data then


[23-Aug-24 07:21 AM] jvaler#0000
each internal offers seller will fill out their template sheet with their authorization keys and item prices, then send me a web published link for me to import into a mastersheet. this mastersheet will then compile all seller's data for easy use by buyers


[23-Aug-24 07:22 AM] tanda#0000
let me know when you need test data


[23-Aug-24 07:22 AM] jvaler#0000
i'm using myself as test data :P


[23-Aug-24 07:22 AM] jvaler#0000
but that might be useful once i start on the mastersheet and need to incorperate multiple sellers


[23-Aug-24 07:23 AM] tanda#0000
hopefully you're using multiple differentiated copies? or at least one bugged sheet like what happened to mine where it lost all the import data for a second


[23-Aug-24 07:23 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I can always return 0 in the burn data field, as could someone else if they didn't want to share it for some reason


[23-Aug-24 07:23 AM] jvaler#0000
still brainstorming how i want to setup the architecture for the mastersheet lol


[23-Aug-24 07:24 AM] jvaler#0000
i am not... should i be? i trust sheets' history feature to undo any severe breakages


[23-Aug-24 07:24 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd probably not want to share the difference between my stock and available stock to buy... but again, I could just fill those two fields with the same value at my end.


[23-Aug-24 07:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
Did you have that thing where the import from an FIO url stopped working?


[23-Aug-24 07:25 AM] tanda#0000
I'd mostly be worried if the master sheet tries to import from a broken feeder sheet


[23-Aug-24 07:25 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah you could move the stock minus buffer calculation to the data processing sheet that way only end stock gets sent


[23-Aug-24 07:25 AM] tanda#0000
Yeah, and I didn't catch it for a while. I think it was a sheets issue, since the import command disappeared from the Gsheets page


[23-Aug-24 07:25 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yep - they had some caching issue


[23-Aug-24 07:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
But you could add some random parameter onto the url to trick it into thinking it was a different one and refreshing


[23-Aug-24 07:27 AM] jvaler#0000
wait no it would be more complicated than this due to how it's structured


[23-Aug-24 07:27 AM] jvaler#0000
you'd have to route those processed numbers into the inventory array


[23-Aug-24 07:29 AM] jvaler#0000
😬

i don't think there's all too much i can do about that, but i do plan on putting data validation settings on as many of the template-side inputs as possible


[23-Aug-24 08:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
Depending on how you’re doing it, it shouldn’t be a huge problem - you’d just have a lookup returning NA or something like that


[23-Aug-24 08:54 AM] jvaler#0000
🤞


[23-Aug-24 09:04 AM] razesdark#0000
I have been kinda dabbling into making a website that lists trade offers and shipping opportunities and have that mirror listings in a discord chat for users not registered on the site. The idea was that if you wanted to use an offer, a discord bot would create a private thread between both parties for further discussion/clarification.

Might as well sell it on the market in this case no ?


[23-Aug-24 09:23 AM] razesdark#0000
I just find Discord somewhat annoying to use when trying to find offers and what not. I'dd love to have something more structured/searchable. It was meant to augment/replace that.


[23-Aug-24 09:50 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Would you be interested in testing with the market bot KAWA uses? Is just a discord bot. You use commands to give it a material, location, and threshold. Then it connects to FIO and if someone else is looking for material to buy, it will display everything you have at that location above your threshold. So it's like an internal offer post that can automatically track supply, but unlike FIDO will *only* show others what is available for sale


[27-Aug-24 06:30 AM] _sashkaa#0000
Is there a site/database of all registered companies?


[27-Aug-24 06:30 AM] _sashkaa#0000
Preferrably with stuff like bases, what do they do, etc.


[27-Aug-24 06:34 AM] laaxus#0000
There's https://doc.fnar.net/#/company/get_company_code__CompanyCode_ but it doesnt work


[27-Aug-24 06:35 AM] laaxus#0000
https://doc.fnar.net/#/company/get_company_name__CompanyName_ works better, you get their base but not what they're doing


[27-Aug-24 06:49 AM] _sashkaa#0000
Interesting


[27-Aug-24 06:50 AM] _sashkaa#0000
My country's ministry of the interior has a publically available database of all tax-paying subjects in the country


[27-Aug-24 06:51 AM] laaxus#0000

[27-Aug-24 06:51 AM] _sashkaa#0000
There's a few websites where you can sorty companies by employee count/revenue/profit/declared area where they operate in


[27-Aug-24 06:52 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't know how they're doing it


[27-Aug-24 06:52 AM] _sashkaa#0000
I might think about doing something similar


[27-Aug-24 06:52 AM] _sashkaa#0000
Players would self-report their productions


[27-Aug-24 06:53 AM] _sashkaa#0000
or maybe we could estimate it by watching CX listings?

[31-Aug-24 01:20 PM] _sashkaa#0000
What's "LEAD"?


[31-Aug-24 01:21 PM] tanda#0000
it's an in game leaderboard that shows a variety of things


[31-Aug-24 01:21 PM] tanda#0000
the most useful of them is commodity production, which lets you see who makes what


[31-Aug-24 01:21 PM] tanda#0000

[31-Aug-24 01:22 PM] _sashkaa#0000

[31-Aug-24 01:22 PM] _sashkaa#0000
not so far!


[31-Aug-24 01:33 PM] razenpok#0000
Isn't FIO basically a game data scraper?


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, but it's just scraping the data that users pull up. So if you have FIO turned on, and you pull up the CX to look up prices on a commodity, that gets shared and stored by FIO


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] tanda#0000
making a tool to actively scrape an entire dataset by passing calls to the server would be against the TOS


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] razenpok#0000
Ah, that's 💯


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] razenpok#0000
Pardon


[31-Aug-24 01:34 PM] razenpok#0000
That's :true:


[31-Aug-24 01:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I was thinking you could pull that information out of CX listings to some extent


[31-Aug-24 01:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But I don't know how to not count arbitrage in that at the moment


[31-Aug-24 01:48 PM] _sashkaa#0000
Exactly my idea


[31-Aug-24 01:50 PM] _sashkaa#0000
if that doesn't work out I am gonna have to try to ask Saganaki about adding LEAD data collection to FIO


[31-Aug-24 02:08 PM] _sashkaa#0000

Pulling all of LEAD yourself, or with a small group (CULT?) in a managed manner isn’t too much work and I already have a scrapper mostly written if you’d be interested in picking it up/organizing it.

Companies ~= Players / Daily_Server_Updates. Some are happy with their first in-game decisions. Others COLIQ; some more never come back. You'll see the true numbers in a few months, when all the newbros start to buy more RAT.AI1 than can be supplied. :/

If you can eventually --- yes eventually.... plop in some time-series data, regarding COM.CX order data, you will start to see very interesting stuff ( involving inter-player competition).

Those projections will get exceedingly scary, for anyone who has access to them.


[31-Aug-24 06:05 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's more of a projection issue, than data recording...


[31-Aug-24 06:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Most server backends, that I've seen, are 2d time series... You may need to pipe the database info, into some sort of matlab/wolfram stuff, to get your hands on 3d projections. I'm not aware of any free database/engines that can do such things, in-house, if they're even open sourced.


[31-Aug-24 09:45 PM] pi3142718#0000
I’m sure you could pipe it into a Python package. Or at worst you can make a mesh and put it in a Python 3D renderer or a proper 3D rendering software

[01-Sep-24 10:30 AM] flor2081#0000

[01-Sep-24 12:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
FIO includes which player collected what data

Would be fun to include a thank you note somewhere


[01-Sep-24 12:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Like on a company page, thing in corner that says "thanks to {COMPANY OR USERNAME OR A COMBINATION HERE} for company data"


[01-Sep-24 12:46 PM] flor2081#0000
fio also collects leaderboard data right? might be better to go there for a max base count

I don't think it does


[01-Sep-24 12:47 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

Yeah, I’m not sure how much closer you could get than that - at some point, ratios and #’s of buildings gets down to the individual planets you’re building on, and what materials you want to over / underproduce

If you need to put it into a header instead of a URL parameter, you can do something like this:

```
function ImportJSONBasicAuth(url, username, password, query, parseOptions) {
  var encodedAuthInformation = Utilities.base64Encode(username + ":" + password);
  var header = {headers: {Authorization: "Basic " + encodedAuthInformation}};
  return ImportJSONAdvanced(url, header, query, parseOptions, includeXPath_, defaultTransform_);
}

function ImportJSONFioAPI(url, authToken, query, parseOptions) {
  var header = {headers: {Authorization: authToken}};
  return ImportJSONAdvanced(url, header, query, parseOptions, includeXPath_, defaultTransform_);
}
```

Unix time
Unix time is a date and time representation widely used in computing. It measures time by the number of non-leap seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, the Unix epoch. In modern computing, values are sometimes stored with higher granularity, such as microseconds or nanoseconds.
Unix time originated as the system time of ...

...the first one ran out of numbers


[29-Oct-24 09:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
I believe for google sheets you have to take that time and divide by 1000, because sheets and excel assume epoch time in seconds.

Thank you, Archiel in with the helpful stuff again


[29-Oct-24 09:32 PM] archielvahr#0000
Also if a number has too many digits, it thinks it is a string

you can use =EPOCHTODATE(######,2) for miliseconds


[29-Oct-24 09:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
To generate a unix time stamp you can: `=(NOW()-DATE(1970,1,1)`

1 is seconds, 3 is microseconds

There were some real doozies on that sheet

When things get weird enough, the answer is just to use `=QUERY(...)` for everything 😄

I always wanted to make a shipping tracker like that though, and a shopping list. Started them both but never finished them

Query has just become my first answer to most things, lol


[31-Oct-24 01:36 PM] manhim#0000
Try mixing QUERY with LET and LAMBDA 😄


[31-Oct-24 01:36 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I want to learn more about pivot tables and appsscript before investing in any more big sheet ideas though


[31-Oct-24 01:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
LAMBDA... that one can wait 😅


[31-Oct-24 01:37 PM] manhim#0000
```=LET(mats, QUERY({IF($C$6="Yes", {Provision!$A$2:$A, Provision!$C$2:$C}, {"", ""}); IF($C$7="Yes", {Burn!$C$2:$C, Burn!$K$2:$K}, {"", ""})}, "SELECT Col1, SUM(Col2) WHERE Col1 <> '' AND Col2 > 0 AND NOT Col1 MATCHES '" & JOIN("|", Provided!$A$2:$A) & "' GROUP BY Col1 ORDER BY Col1 ASC LABEL SUM(Col2) ''"), BYROW(mats, LAMBDA(row, {INDEX(row, 0, 1), VLOOKUP(INDEX(row, 0, 1), Prices!$A$2:$I, 2, FALSE), INDEX(row, 0, 2), VLOOKUP(INDEX(row, 0, 1), Prices!$A$2:$I, 3, FALSE), INDEX(row, 0, 2) * VLOOKUP(INDEX(row, 0, 1), Prices!$A$2:$I, 3, FALSE)})))```


[31-Oct-24 01:37 PM] manhim#0000
Looks so ugly in Discord


[31-Oct-24 01:38 PM] manhim#0000
LET and LAMBDA lets you reference to the same query results multiple times


[31-Oct-24 01:38 PM] manhim#0000
So I can hide data from my summaries, but still calculate from them


[31-Oct-24 01:39 PM] manhim#0000
Basically, I make 1 QUERY for the raw data, then output each rows with formulas


[31-Oct-24 01:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ohhh that's interesting. I will have to look into that. There are some cases where I worked really hard to avoid intermediate calculation cells, especially when stuff like FILTER wants you to repeat elements


[31-Oct-24 01:39 PM] manhim#0000
Hell yeah


[31-Oct-24 01:40 PM] archielvahr#0000
awesome tip 😄


[31-Oct-24 01:40 PM] manhim#0000
Makes for cleaner sheets, and removes the need for intermediary sheets for more complex calculations (but I still use them, cause I'm not THAT savage)


[31-Oct-24 01:41 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Yeah I love LET for that specifically. Still can't wrap my head around LAMBDA though...

[31-Oct-24 01:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've started using the discontinous stuff quite a bit, like `FILTER({B49:C,I49:I} ... ` It helps with things like vlookup too, when there's a huge mess of columns


[31-Oct-24 07:36 PM] jcheung#0000

It works similar to a programming function

```Function functionName(argument1, argument2) {
Return argument1 + argument2

Then i can call it with `functionName(1,2)` and get 3 as a result

What the function processes then is

```return 1 + 2```


[10-Nov-24 09:12 PM] jcheung#0000
That any clearer or not really


[10-Nov-24 09:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Well. To be clear, functionName is assigned with let()


[10-Nov-24 09:12 PM] tanda#0000
I understand basic programming, and I used to work in SQL


[10-Nov-24 09:13 PM] tanda#0000
Excel's terminology is vastly unfamiliar to me


[10-Nov-24 09:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Lambda is an anonymous function


[10-Nov-24 09:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Is that better?


[10-Nov-24 09:14 PM] tanda#0000
now that I'm actually bothering to look at it, Lambda looks like "find in string" or general string parsing, just without needing loops to step through


[10-Nov-24 09:15 PM] tanda#0000
correction, it's a method of acting on data you've already extracted


[10-Nov-24 09:15 PM] tanda#0000
looks like it can be used for a wide variety of applications, including math as well as string parsing


[10-Nov-24 09:15 PM] manhim#0000
LAMBDA is used to send an anonymous function as a parameter. It's usually used with helpers like BYROW or BYCOLUMN so that you can execute the anonymous function on each rows or columns (and others like MAP, etc.)


[10-Nov-24 09:16 PM] manhim#0000
Allows you to execute the function x amount of time, x being the amount of data to process based on the helper (or the raw data).


[10-Nov-24 09:16 PM] jcheung#0000
There's an explaination by someone who actually knows more than a textbook


[10-Nov-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
alright I get it, LAMBDA is a defined function. It does whatever it's told to do and can be called upon multiple times in the same function


[10-Nov-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
so if I need it to increment a variable by 1, it can do that or it can do what it's being used here for, which is to parse strings to find values for output


[10-Nov-24 09:18 PM] jcheung#0000
It's not defined technically
Let defines it


[10-Nov-24 09:18 PM] manhim#0000
There's also a usage to reuse the input data multiple time. So if you have a complex query and you need to reference to it multiple times in a calculation, then you can use the variable name rather than copy-pasting the whole query.


[10-Nov-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
~~*user defined~~ The method by which a user defines and names a reusable function


[10-Nov-24 09:19 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah


[10-Nov-24 09:19 PM] manhim#0000
To be fair, I'm pretty sure that this query could be simplified


[10-Nov-24 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
most likely, I merely checked it for whether or not it returned the correct values, not whether it was efficient at it


[11-Nov-24 07:48 AM] laaxus#0000
anybody know how to fix this bug ?

On the https://fio.fnar.net/burnrate go to your settings and there’s a button. Reset data then go back to prun and visit every base Jen refresh

How is the "optimal day", in the repair part of prunplanner, calculated ?


[17-Nov-24 04:23 AM] laaxus#0000
does it take into account the loss of production ?


[17-Nov-24 08:22 AM] jcheung#0000
probably not


[17-Nov-24 08:22 AM] jcheung#0000
but usually by 45/60 it hasn't degraded too far


[17-Nov-24 08:24 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
idk, it probably does. Most tools that have tried to calculate that so far have compared the profit of items made to loss of production capacity to determine a value metric of some kind, then compared that to the repair cost every time the needed materials tick up


[17-Nov-24 08:25 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
cause what you're looking for is: when does the cost of lost production outweigh the cost of repair materials


[17-Nov-24 08:34 AM] jcheung#0000
well the graph is the basic one from prun repair guide


[17-Nov-24 08:34 AM] jcheung#0000
not the advanced ones


[17-Nov-24 08:34 AM] jcheung#0000
rather not the expert one


[17-Nov-24 08:58 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah the graph is just repair cost. But idk how you'd calculate the *optimal* day *without* factoring in loss of production


[17-Nov-24 09:44 AM] jcheung#0000
@scintillating_iridescence found a bug with your loan calculator
annuity loan drops off last payment

suggestion for fix:
H7:H
```=let(
interest,H6*(1+$F$3),
principal,$E$3,
totalReturn,G6,
principalRemaining,principal-totalReturn,
if(principal-(totalReturn+interest)>0,interest,if(principalRemaining>0,principalRemaining,0))
)

ALT:
=if($E$3-(G6+H6*(1+$F$3))>0,H6*(1+$F$3),if($E$3-G6>0,$E$3-G6,0))```

F7:F
```=IF(E6>0,$F$3*E6,0)```


[17-Nov-24 09:45 AM] jcheung#0000
i think a similar bug may exist for stable loan too, but i haven't gotten to that yet


[17-Nov-24 09:48 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah, it does


[17-Nov-24 09:48 AM] jcheung#0000
D7:D
```=IF(B6-D6>0,D6,B6)```


[17-Nov-24 09:49 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, there's the same thing on the Stable side, but it's just a feature of how the calculations were run.

The point of the thing was to quickly batch up total interest costs for a given loan offer, so that borrowers and lenders can easily see what's going to happen, and how much the profits/liquidity matter to them.


[17-Nov-24 09:49 AM] jcheung#0000
and i'm giving you a fix


[17-Nov-24 09:49 AM] jcheung#0000
if you would like to implement them


[17-Nov-24 09:55 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
yeah no I popped the whole libreoffice sheet to jvaler, who dropped a gsheet copy and posted the permalink.

You can fix it and resubmit the edited version, so that the fixed g-sheet tool can have its permalink re-edited or whatnot. I say that cuz I'm a pure idiot with variable setting and use in gsheets, so you really don't want me to fix it, lol. 

You can drop your name in on the side notes for patch credit too! 😄


[17-Nov-24 09:57 AM] jcheung#0000
oh. thought you were owner 😂


[17-Nov-24 09:57 AM] jcheung#0000
the ALT for first fix doesn't use variables 😛


[17-Nov-24 10:08 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmm, lets see.


[17-Nov-24 10:10 AM] jcheung#0000
it probably has inefficiencies to be ironed out, but hey


[17-Nov-24 10:12 AM] jcheung#0000
some additional alterations made, in case you want to also do them to your local copy
J6:J
```=$J$3-sum($L$6:L6)```

K6
```=J3*$A$3```

K7:K
```=J6*$K$3```

purpose: match other two where 0 is shown on final term principal remaining


[17-Nov-24 10:12 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
yeah that fixes the run-overs for the annuities.


[17-Nov-24 10:14 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
**Interest** loans only pay out interest. All of the principle gets returned on the final interest payment. I think that one is a feature. 🙂 *Ugh I hate these loan type names.*


[17-Nov-24 10:17 AM] jcheung#0000
eh. the others also have principle to be returned on final payment too


[17-Nov-24 12:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Fixed out the remaining mismatch bugs

how's the user experience on the PMMG fork?


[26-Nov-24 02:25 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Is it faster. More comprehensive? More intuitive? Gimme your experiences, if you've tried it out already.


[26-Nov-24 02:34 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Don’t know about faster - time will show.
It has a slicker and more compressed UI, which I like. 
If you know PMMG, you’ll feel right at home. And the fork has some extra features. 
Over all, it feels like a bit more polished version of PMMG with some extra stuff and prettier icons.


[26-Nov-24 02:34 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I like the condition indicator of the ships

XIT BURN is clearer and easier to read


[26-Nov-24 02:36 PM] pxlfox.#0000
And the switch was really easy and quick


[26-Nov-24 02:37 PM] astra1414#0000
it's a shame, really liked what piboy did for the community. but i guess there's always competition somewhere


[26-Nov-24 02:39 PM] pxlfox.#0000
As far as I understood PiBoy had to back down from PrUn and PMMG due to real life stuff. And they seemed to be really supportive about the fork.


[26-Nov-24 02:39 PM] pxlfox.#0000
And they did the groundwork. So it’s more of a PMMG 2.0


[26-Nov-24 02:49 PM] jvaler#0000
it feels much more responsive because i think the data collection method is different from PMMG. stuff like XIT BURN and XIT CONTS update instantly when changes occur, and they're much more reliable as far as i can tell. i'd often have issues with pmmg's XIT BURN not updating for extended periods of time, but that doesn't happen with rprun.


[26-Nov-24 03:10 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmm sounds good. 

I'll give it a spin on the weekend. I have very low requirements (efficiency, low memory use, and GUI scalability/retention, so that I don't have to zoom out to like -50% to see all the details). If I leik it, I'll start to push it on the in-game COMGs.


[26-Nov-24 03:13 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But third party tools have the same issues, everywhere. 

Once a dev needs much more time for RL stuff, or loses interest for "reasons", maintenance/upgrades of a given tool fall off, and are eventually depreciated. I push basic maths around all the time, since it's the most basic redundancy that any player can have. If PMMG++++ gets a second wind, so be it.


[26-Nov-24 03:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
<--- seen the same stuff in Eve over the years. It's not fun, for anyone. :/

You been there?

Wait, wrong place to talk about it


[03-Dec-24 08:24 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'm releasing the next iteration of my #DANK-Tools lineup... The POPI Planner, in beta! \o/.

(alpha testing was performed with unwilling volunteers, that I keep entrapped on Promitor, unofficially known as the Pits of Prose)...

Anyways, I've found that while our beloved GOV sheet answers many questions, others are still left floating around in our to-do lists. One of those questions is the construction cost of any POPI/PPS upgrade. This question relates to several considerations that either PMs on established planets, or new-found planetary developers might have:

1) How much will these, times x SST, INF, PAR, or else cost me or my tax base?
2) How do these costs scale per level?
3) How much of a piggy bank do I/we need, to purchase them outright on the CX?
4) How can I engage in these maths, to contribute to some discussion on a GOV COMG, or in Discord?
5) If I want to simplify the whole process, how many MCG, TRU, BBH, etc, do I need in total?

[03-Dec-24 08:24 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The tool presented, offers some elucidation regarding these things, to anyone concerned who hasn't made their own tools for it. Manual and FIO-integrated price calculations have been included, since some things just aren't for sale on the CX. 

It's meant to be directly imported into g-sheets. If you want to use it solely in Excel, feel free, since it's a public mockup. (I'm not hosting a public g-sheet :P)

Analysis of the cost figures has been left out, since it will be included in a later update with more features, whenever I get around to formatting it all.


[03-Dec-24 08:27 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
This sounds awesome! (I can't look into it until I'm back on PC later)


[03-Dec-24 08:28 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I've been wanting to modify Archiel's sheet to factor in a depreciated cost of upgrades to daily cost calculations just to get an idea.


[03-Dec-24 08:30 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, I've tested it out already on some mid-range upgrades to Pallada... the math is perfect. 

It's not included on the GOV sheet, since I'm keeping the matrix calculations to be as simple as possible, giving a rather fast tool.


[04-Dec-24 01:54 AM] evov#0000
I did a similar thing but for a different purpose.

I wanted to see how the cost of the capital used to build the inf ( Assuming cost of capital is worth about 2% per week.. or set it to whatever seems appropriate ) compared to the cost of upkeeps. Basically just converting capital costs into a daily cost so it's easier to evaluate across different cost types.

At what points did it make more sense to simply use 2 or 3 or more of the different types of upkeeps, and when does it make more sense to upgrade. Or... when does it make sense to use the large or mixed versions of the buildings compared to the more commonly used small versions.

RoH's sheet sounds like good info to have out there as I don't believe I've seen any public info on those costs floating around.


[04-Dec-24 06:06 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hmm. Well per level, the cost of upkeep increases on a steady linear basis, of 1000/n, 2500/n, or 5000/n (with n denoting the number of upkeep material tiers possible, on a continual basis). The cost of upgrade however, grows along a parabolic basis, being 1.2x the previous level.

So the relationship that you get is ever increasing sunk costs, with a relatively diminishing return of said costs, the larger the planet gets. Skewed POPR metrics don't help that relationship either.

I'm pretty sure Archiel's sheet does a wonderful job on the upkeep cost analysis, but I'll implement your train of thought, with a bit of Evovian flair, to flesh out any possibilities.

@_sashkaa we're having discussion about prunstats in UFO, i have a question


[12-Dec-24 09:41 PM] jvaler#0000
does prunstats report cumulative stats? or does it account for removals and subtracts from the data accordingly


[12-Dec-24 09:41 PM] jvaler#0000
because gravy doesn't have 68 bases, the HQ level highscore is only 50


[13-Dec-24 02:57 AM] _sashkaa#0000
This is a limitation of FIO im afraid, it doesn't tell us when bases get deleted


[13-Dec-24 02:59 AM] jvaler#0000
that's unfortunate


[13-Dec-24 03:51 AM] _sashkaa#0000
I was thinking of making a "claiming" system for self-reporting data that's hard to get


[13-Dec-24 03:52 AM] _sashkaa#0000
Claim your company with your email, then say what sort of stuff you produce, how much, etc.

Couldn't we give you a fio key ?


[13-Dec-24 04:00 AM] jcheung#0000
would that help with limitations of FIO? 🤔


[13-Dec-24 04:01 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, you could see burn rates


[13-Dec-24 04:01 AM] laaxus#0000
a base without burn can be considered dead


[13-Dec-24 04:01 AM] laaxus#0000
and a player without any base burning is inactive


[13-Dec-24 04:01 AM] jcheung#0000
can it? what if someone dropped a core module and is reserving a slot


[13-Dec-24 04:02 AM] jcheung#0000
in that case you have a base


[13-Dec-24 04:02 AM] laaxus#0000
We can't see that unfortunately I_believe
but it would still be better than currently, no ?


[13-Dec-24 04:02 AM] jcheung#0000
but no burn


[13-Dec-24 04:02 AM] jcheung#0000
"better" depends on your end use case


[15-Dec-24 12:16 AM] jvaler#0000
with all this free time i'm working on that sheet again. i think the template is pretty much done, it just needs instructions made for it

I feel like those data isn't representative


[02-Feb-25 12:01 PM] pxlfox.#0000
because the market isn't reacting to it


[02-Feb-25 12:03 PM] pxlfox.#0000
for example: if the CU market is oversupplied by 5k for over a month, prices should already have fallen, didn't they?


[02-Feb-25 12:03 PM] pxlfox.#0000
same goes for AU


[02-Feb-25 12:04 PM] jvaler#0000
afaik it's just taking the supply/demand numbers you see on CXM


[02-Feb-25 12:04 PM] jvaler#0000
which aren't always accurate, because people can post asks/bids that are totally unreasonable and would never be interacted with, but it still gets counted as supply/demand


[02-Feb-25 12:05 PM] pxlfox.#0000
CXM shows bids vs asks?

seems like you're right


[02-Feb-25 12:13 PM] pxlfox.#0000
and then again, those values aren't really telling us about the real supply and demand, because it doesn't include trade volume


[02-Feb-25 12:13 PM] pxlfox.#0000
just the amount listed on the market


[02-Feb-25 12:24 PM] pxlfox.#0000
that would be a more realistic ask/bid for CU

[06-Feb-25 09:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
Is there a sheet to make the CSV for you?


[06-Feb-25 09:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I have an other version, which excludes the consumables and takes the mass/volume of the materials and not the amount

[06-Feb-25 09:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I made myself one, yes


[06-Feb-25 09:53 AM] pagy1234#0000
That gives a massively different graph, wow


[06-Feb-25 09:53 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh yeah that would be nice


[06-Feb-25 10:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
yeah, the first one shows the amount of resources produced and consumed and highlights surpluses and deficiencies


[06-Feb-25 10:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
the second one displays the logistic demand of the production lines


[06-Feb-25 10:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
IA-151a consumes the most amount of materials, IA-151e has the heaviest ones and needs the most shipping


[06-Feb-25 10:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah


[06-Feb-25 10:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
Thats pretty neat


[06-Feb-25 10:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
Functional and looks nice


[06-Feb-25 11:29 AM] taiyibureau#0000
That sounds reasonable. I'm probably not going to use the sheet myself, but for the demand curve on prun planner that would be nice to have.


[06-Feb-25 11:30 AM] taiyibureau#0000
That is pretty much the only place I would interact with this kind of data.


[06-Feb-25 11:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yeah, I think it would make sense for PP to at least exclude the parking-offers from the demand/supply


[06-Feb-25 08:55 PM] evov#0000
That looks cool AF. Make one that covers my production stuff pls.

But to make it work you need either setup all your bases in PrunPlanner, use the FIO extension or provide the burn data manually. I feel all those options contradict with your mantra 😂

When I set materials I have in the pruplanner "construction cart", sometimes it appears to save them for next time, but most of the time it doesn't.   Is there any sense of what governs this?  (It doesn't appear to be affected by the planet's "save" button, which doesn't seem to register this at all).


[14-Feb-25 09:26 AM] jcheung#0000

so uh


[06-Apr-25 10:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Im thinking about making a program to balance rates for goods productions


[06-Apr-25 10:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
basing it on differential equations and matrix operators


[06-Apr-25 10:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
my problem is I can do the maths, but am unsure about how to go about making said program


[07-Apr-25 01:24 AM] evov#0000
Can you give an example of what you're trying to achieve?


[07-Apr-25 01:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah so like in the planning phase i think it would be nice to balance material outputs and inputs for simple to complex chains


[07-Apr-25 01:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
EG how much triple double and single burn to run given my outputs from my HYF and FRM


[07-Apr-25 01:30 AM] evov#0000
Not sure if this is helpful at all, but this is the method I used for planning out complicated production lines  ( ships, gateways etc ) -

It looks like this in a sheet - I start with how much of each final product I need  ( in this case PSH/RSH/TSH is shown ) - and work backwards from there. It lets me know how much "build time" is needed for each of the building types, and how much raw materials / inputs I'll need to buy.

In this example I stop the chain at the point where it makes sense for me to buy it from the CX rather than try to produce it myself.

[07-Apr-25 01:32 AM] evov#0000
Then I go through an add up all the blue boxes for each coresponding building. And add up all the raw inputs with a CX next to it. And that's what's needed to build that volume of parts. Once I know the process time required - I can scale the number of buildings needed after deciding on a run-rate  ( i.e. 1 gateway every 100 days )

I'm sure you can automate it a lot better if it's a tool you plan to use for many things, but that's the basic algorithm / process that works for me.


[07-Apr-25 01:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I figured it’s a problem that comes up frequent enough that it could maybe use a handy dandy tool


[07-Apr-25 01:37 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Have a DB with all the recipes


[07-Apr-25 01:37 AM] jab.sh#0000
"where it makes sense to buy from the CX" is this a gut feel or is your sheet doing that math?


[07-Apr-25 01:38 AM] evov#0000
I have a pretty big gut. It's pretty good at feeling stuff out.

[07-Apr-25 01:39 AM] jab.sh#0000
I'm imagining a tool where you enter an end product, and it shows you all the ingredients with checkboxes. if it's checked that means cx, if you uncheck it then it builds out the ingredients for that part and so on


[07-Apr-25 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
i started poking at something similar but never got very far

[07-Apr-25 01:43 AM] evov#0000
It's just a question of time investment. If I'm designing a new complicated production line- it might take 1 or 2 hours to do all the prep/planning/balancing etc... and then a few months to implement the plans.

There's a limited number of products that (imo) require that level of planning that goes 3+ bases deep.


[07-Apr-25 01:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Why do think I’m asking questions in here


[07-Apr-25 01:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Fair


[07-Apr-25 01:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I feel like it is an excuse to practice my trash coding skills tho


[07-Apr-25 01:45 AM] evov#0000
It's an interesting problem to solve. I'm a knuckle dragging halfwit, so I'm sure you can come up with a far more elegant solution than I have. But those are the basic steps on how I solved the problem with a sheet anyway.


[07-Apr-25 01:45 AM] .urpalhal#0000
That’s for sure


[07-Apr-25 01:46 AM] evov#0000
The next one of these type problems on my table to work through is a Gov admin one. Incorporating capital costs / intrest payments on that capital when looking at cost effective upkeeps.


[07-Apr-25 01:48 AM] evov#0000
I feel like people upgrading things to lvl 10 and stacking the 1 upkeep into it feels like a disgusting waste of capital in the pursuit of keeping op-ex as low as possible.

oh man if it's open source then you can probably just replace the data and it should work the same


[07-Apr-25 01:56 AM] jab.sh#0000
does the tool support alternate recipes?


[07-Apr-25 01:57 AM] jab.sh#0000
I'm thinking CX buy could be an "alternate recipe"


[07-Apr-25 02:01 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yes


[07-Apr-25 02:01 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You can also just manually set inputs for things too


[07-Apr-25 02:02 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So like if you have another factory making Y which is used in X then you can just say I have so much of Y per second

Use the prun planner for things like... a ship. Even simpler - 1 part of the 13 parts needed... a CQL for example.

I suspect it would be harder/longer for me to convert that prun planer info into a workable build plan, than it would if I just used my custom sheet tools for it.

Look at the minimap to get an idea of the scale of that chart just for CQL's

not really. it kinda does

well if i get the math mathed out someone should help me make it look pretty


[08-Apr-25 02:29 AM] magican1980#0000
yes, some kind of sheet for ship production ist nice 🙂 and would be some kind of complex.


[08-Apr-25 02:31 AM] magican1980#0000
and in only one product like CQL are going a lot of elements of production. But it is the same for higher Base and luxury consumables


[16-Apr-25 04:49 PM] jvaler#0000


[20-Apr-25 04:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think a linear optomization model could work. I have seen/heard of people using Pyomo Python library and a open source solver called GLPK. I think imma go see how all that works
