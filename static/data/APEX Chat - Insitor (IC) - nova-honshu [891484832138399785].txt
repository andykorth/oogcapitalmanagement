[29-Sep-21 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	The effect of it running only on DW will be reflected in next weeks report


[29-Sep-21 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	If any of you produce SUN or OFF, keep selling it. Usually just DW is enough

**peacefighter1996**:	For those that have premium. Look into trade between BEN and HRT because of current Exchange rate ICA/CIS


[03-Oct-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	for instance EPO.CI1 and EPO.IC1


[03-Oct-21 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	Do note that it is not the other way around CIS/ICA

**jameskiller98**:	It really depends on how many resources whether it be input or population requirements I have I basically plan it based on how long I can run my lines


[06-Oct-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Oct-21 12:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ikkas**:	Is the local market used frequently?


[28-Oct-21 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	I dont think so


[28-Oct-21 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Main us is shipping contracts i think


[28-Oct-21 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	aight, good to know, thanks


[28-Oct-21 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	The main issue with the local market is that unlike a commodity exchange you have to pay to put up offers for goods they expire if you have that set and lets say you want to say 1000 Overalls someone has to either buy them in bulk or you have to put them in smaller chunks which cost more money


[28-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	That does seem like an issue


[28-Oct-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	Gotta love the sumif function in excel tho


[28-Oct-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	thanks


[28-Oct-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	appreciate it


[28-Oct-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	feel free to ask me to update anything if you need it


[28-Oct-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Best to make deals and use the local market to conduct the deal


[28-Oct-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	thats the "intended" use - in my view


[28-Oct-21 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	on ohter news: Safety and Health look good - the planet should be in a good position to support population growth for a while now.


[28-Oct-21 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	yeah agreed we were running close for a bit there


[28-Oct-21 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Oct-21 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	look on LM for a package for the return trip


[31-Oct-21 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	oh damn, fuel is expensive


[31-Oct-21 03:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	ikkas you can lower your ftl and STL consumption by lowering your speed by the way


[31-Oct-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	ye ik, still around 1k to hortus


[31-Oct-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	yeah its slow to start then you increase as you go


[31-Oct-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	alot of people do weekly runs


[31-Oct-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	or longer


[31-Oct-21 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	sry laying in bed with a cold


[31-Oct-21 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	provisioned now


[31-Oct-21 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	oh thanks, no worries


[31-Oct-21 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Ok folks. Taxes are on lowest setting (cant go lower because planet is in faction space)


[31-Oct-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Besides POPI projects there is still the warehouse and COGC to be build.


[31-Oct-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Is there any interest in building any of the 2?


[31-Oct-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	My personal opinion:


[31-Oct-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	warehouse - I dont think we need it. It could be useful for extra storage but it comes with weekly renting price, it could also ignite outside trade - but the only good thing we have to offer is CLI and NE - NE is over supplied on the CX already


[31-Oct-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	COGC - expensive to build but it does provide a nice production boost, problem will be deciding on what boost we would be running, General Pioneer 10% boost or a specific boost to a industry


[31-Oct-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	I am good either way


[01-Nov-21 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	even though I'm importing a lot of metal. I still think its better to do the COGC. Mostly because, if someone needs more storage space they can build a  Storage Facility on your land for 5000 storage for 15 land, and the the boosts of the COGC are overall nice.


[01-Nov-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	CogC would be my pick


[01-Nov-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	my only question is will it be worth it for upkeep


[01-Nov-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	@james - my base is a bit full - it could be that the contract will not let you deliver - in about 2h i have space to receive the contract


[01-Nov-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	@james there is now enough space for delivery


[01-Nov-21 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	I think so. The upkeep with current rates is about 17.5K ICA (based on FK-794b). And with the boost I could earn 6.3K ICA (10% pioneer )- 12.8K ICA (25% manufacturing) extra in that week period. And if we share the load of the upkeep this can give quite the boost. (Sorry that I did not do my share yet ":)).


[01-Nov-21 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	for transparency: weekly tax payout is between 4-5k ICA


[01-Nov-21 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	That's about 58 to 72 factories that are online.


[01-Nov-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	Oh and if someone is in need of PT.IC1 I can sell to for 225. If I can get some cheap construction prefabs. Or I can even supply with AL.IC1 for a 2:1 ratio


[01-Nov-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	sell that for*

**pawscieniu**:	as one of the new faces, hello all, started playing a week ago and after learning the ropes restarted, now I intend to contibute to planetary projects as soon as it will be possible (the prospect of "upgrading" a planet is really freaking cool), hope to get along well :)


[07-Nov-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	focus on building yourself up first


[07-Nov-21 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	to be honest you will need the extra building's to help yourself to benefit to the contributions


[07-Nov-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	i'm getting my fifth factory and going to be able to get my sixth here soon and I'm 67 days in and it just grows from then


[07-Nov-21 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	then the cogc and things can help you


[07-Nov-21 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pawscieniu**:	yea i know it's growth first, but you need to have the ultimate goal in mind


[07-Nov-21 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Anyone got MCG?


[07-Nov-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	Anyway.


[15-Nov-21 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Feel free to answer: Who here is making NE to exclusively sell it to the MM ? - This is just a Survey our of curiosity


[15-Nov-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pawscieniu**:	I intend to but didn't build the collector yet


[15-Nov-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	MM?


[15-Nov-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	Fellows does work. Directors could also work but makes it quite formal. But maybe Novaneers could also work. It al depends if people adopt one form or another.


[15-Nov-21 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	Market maker is what he is meaning peacefighter the Infinite amounts on the hortus CX that buy or sell good


[15-Nov-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	Why sell to the MM? I make plenty of money selling for a lot more than that.


[15-Nov-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**pawscieniu**:	Well, having just started I figured it will generate comparable amounts of money as CLI, but consume less space, tonnage etc. I really only have cash for 2-3 days supplies for other lines so i need to make money somehow without an input, at least for a while


[15-Nov-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	Ah, I only used them once for excess C.ic1. but in general I sell products that have a good demand. Some of those don't even have MM.


[15-Nov-21 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	But I must say. With current trends collector's and extractor earn about 1k day which is relatively decent. But I would not recommend investing everything in one sector.


[15-Nov-21 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	Some people focus on the MMA as they generate cash and therefore create inflation whereas we would have deflation otherwise as more goods with the same amount of money means goods cost less whereas if generate money but getting rid of goods you get an inflation meaning your prices will increase


[15-Nov-21 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	Also the MM is stable so if you can always make money from it why risk things


[15-Nov-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	Risk is inherent with the area that the game is operating in. Nothing is without risk here. While we don't have to deal with military incursion yet. We are at the mercy of the fluctuation of the market. And even with "stable" income, I agree they can give a good boost. However, When prices for consumables inflate you still have some problems even with the MMA.

[16-Nov-21 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jameskiller98**:	are taxes increasing any time soon or is the increased production of everyone paying for this enough?


[30-Nov-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	i honestly dont know :D i am getting about 4-5k each 7 days, in turn i do stuff for the planet *shrug*


[30-Nov-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	We are so small, and backwater, the paperwork aint worth the hassle


[30-Nov-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	so i wing it.


[30-Nov-21 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	upkeep costs every 7 days: (old) ~120 DW and 70 TUB - (new) ~120 DW 70 TUB and 21 SUN


[30-Nov-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	buying that on CX would add up to: (old) ~11.300 ICA - (new) ~17200 ICA


[30-Nov-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	important to note, TUB and SUN and not well supplied and might be overpriced


[30-Nov-21 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	to get a fair compensation, taxes would have to be atleast doubled. If money should be collected for expanding infrastructure, even trippled or quadruple


[01-Dec-21 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	I can provide SUN for about 175 each, that would drive down the upkeep cost significantly.


[01-Dec-21 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	however, currwently I don't have enough funds to pay for the input. So it will take a bit of time.


[01-Dec-21 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	got some goods for sale that should provide me with the funds however I will probably require a shipping contract as none of my ships are at HRT atm


[01-Dec-21 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	oh, those are justp rices based on CX


[01-Dec-21 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	i actually make all inputs my self anyway


[01-Dec-21 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	so i imagine the cost is actually cheaper, its just costing me some more income.


[01-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**peacefighter1996**:	I dont know how your chain looks like but probably


[01-Dec-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	I produce TUB on-planet and would be happy to provide very cheaply for us.


[01-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DanX**:	Or I could contribute directly if we're trying to share the costs.

[05-Dec-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	how often? and is it like a full reset or just partial?


[05-Dec-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	last reset was 284 days ago. the universe before this ran about 2 years but the intention was to only run it for 6 months.


[05-Dec-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	resets are full and when deemed necessary


[05-Dec-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MarkNstein**:	Been a month since I started with the "Construction" package and things are going well. I've been weighing my options for expanding my current base. A WELding plant seems decent. A SIO EXTractor with a Glass Furnace seem good too. Vertically integrating with SMEltry seems a poor choice. Do you -my neighbours- have any thoughts?


[11-Mar-22 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkNstein**:	Complimenting my PP1 with a PP2 also looks good. Could skip the Extractor if someone else is already extracting and wants to do SIO LM trades in the future

[03-Apr-22 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MarkNstein**:	I've built a Glass Furnace now. I've not yet build an EXT for SIO, and I may not if my SIO buy-ads keep filling locally. I'll fill the Infirmary with some `TUB` to help out soon.


[24-Apr-22 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkNstein**:	with 30percent margins, I'll be posting SIO buy-ads at 52ea, and GL sell-ads at 142 ea.    I sourced some cheap `SEN` which will allow me to produce GL extra fast (for my single GF)

[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there.


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	btw im curious as to why ur buying CLI in LM?


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	cause maybe someone is making excess


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	and instead of shipping it to CX wasting fuel ill buy it


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	does anyone ever buy it?


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	i buy it


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	ye but from you


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	I process it


[05-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	i was wondering if you wer just doing some welfare


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	not really, just paying a fair price for not having to ship / buy from CX


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	ye thats fair


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	i just saw buy and sell orders at the same price and was a bit confused


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	OH!


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	aaand i once again forgot about the paywall for lm lel


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	thanks for reminding me that I have CLI on the CX


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	i totally forgot i had that


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	are you making I or SOI btw?


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	someone asked me to make SOI


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	ah, i never looked into making it, i just dump all my cli into iodine


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	or i think i looked into it and could find any brm


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	can be good buisness


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	but I main use is MHL


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	and people making MHL make their own I cause its so low usage


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	ye


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	making MHL on the other hand... its only used in HYF. people who run HYF make their own MHL because of thje low supply and high price


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	hence why i have like 110 I sitting on market, granted the prices im requesting are kinda stupid but


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	it would be a good market as MHL is in constant need but its so slow to produce


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	But you could make money with MHL


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	just need to import FE and HE


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	both should be cheap at moria


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ikkas**:	tru


[05-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a difficult start on this planet.

**Gladi099**:	Update on the CoGC: I have aquired all the Lfabs and materials for the BWS - I will be producing them myself. CoGC program goal: Manufacturing


[18-May-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spezialist**:	I'm confused - wasn't the goal construction? After all, that's why you raised the production fees for construction, right?


[18-May-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkNstein**:	I remember the final decision being Manu' - I certainly get better returns out of my BMPs than PP1. Shipping the FE and AL sucks.


[18-May-22 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spezialist**:	But why the higher production fees specifically for construction then? Doesn't make sense to me...


[18-May-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	It was Manu or construction - whatever the cogc lands on


[18-May-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Subversus**:	With a possibility for more favourable pricing if anyone wants to set up a regular supply deal.


[27-May-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MarkNstein**:	I can share that my current DW/RAT consumption is currently 23/24 per day. Not entirely relevant but I also *try* to keep over a week's worth of base and prod' supplies.

**Stonke**:	1 bmp to convert some cli to iodine


[03-Jun-22 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonke**:	then ship everything to MOR as the prices there are the best so far


[03-Jun-22 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jun-22 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Yeah Stonke that is a good plan. I demand is up due to MHL demand.


[03-Jun-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	and you want to sell I at a higher price than CLI, cause there are CLI taps that produce more CLI than Nova so you want to maximise capacity

[04-Jun-22 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Subversus**:	I'm about 3-4 days from those ships returning to Nova so if they're still there when I'm doing that I'll grab em

[04-Jun-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a difficult start on this planet.

**Gladi099**:	@doctorFailmore I post it every now and then. Also Pro/Basic requires to pay for the game and anything involving these mechanics i try to avoid as advice for new players. Game is plenty viable for TRIAL users.


[13-Jun-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	so I'm guessing there's no way to retrofit a WCB.IC1 onto an existing ship?


[13-Jun-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to try and build the entire MHL.IC1 pipeline here, or try to export either CLI.IC1 or I.IC1 in bulk


[13-Jun-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	it feels like a waste to spend all the base area on BMPs and WELs when CLI is so rare, but it also feels like trying to ship it without processing fully into MHL is going to be a nightmare


[13-Jun-22 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dipster**:	what we need is automated ship orders / trade routes


[13-Jun-22 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a difficult start on this planet.

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a difficult start on this planet.

**Gladi099**:	Anyone wondering what to do: NE might go up in price soon or already has. Supply is limited on CX. Might be worth looking into and extracting if you have nothing else to do.

**Id10t**:	3RD base hype... I am now making a trickle of COT (about 6 per day) will place it in small batches on the LM around the bid amount price on hortus for the time being :)


[11-Sep-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	i put it up there for 3 days collection but it will probably be quicker under most circumstances :)


[11-Sep-22 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Coccoro**:	still having trouble to fill up this 2nd base for me thou.. not sure what to do next


[11-Sep-22 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	yee, new base hype is the best. If only it would just happen more often ^_^'


[11-Sep-22 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	@coccoro well, if you are totally stumpted what do next, I'd say making a frm-base with 1 fp and 1 rig is atleast the most maintenance-free base you can make


[12-Sep-22 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	lol you want maintence free, a maxed out base producing rco only needs to be resupplied every 2 weeks... :) i know from experience lol


[12-Sep-22 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Coccoro**:	lol


[12-Sep-22 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-22 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Sep-22 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	I want to sell 100 MCG. I posted an ad with total price 100 x 35 (asking price) x 1500 (fuel needed to carry it from Hortus Station)


[14-Sep-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	you think this is a valid approach?


[14-Sep-22 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	mcg for 55/u is pretty steep price, specially since it can be manufactured here as long you bring lst here


[14-Sep-22 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	so wouldn't bet on that you gonna get a sale, but hey, who knows, right?


[14-Sep-22 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is also a really good source of LST not to far from here, that you can bulk buy cheaply


[14-Sep-22 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	I see your point. Yes, it might sell but I would like to post fair trades in general. Not scammy.


[14-Sep-22 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the issue is this place is a source of MCG, not a great source mind you, but a source all the same


[14-Sep-22 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	places where something is produced sell the product cheaper since it doesn't involve shipping


[14-Sep-22 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	also, there's nothing scammy in selling high price imo. If you find a buyer, it's nothing but a win win ^_^


[14-Sep-22 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's why, especially since I got my first upgraded ship (got my second earlier today) I have often looked for where a material is being produced and flown my ship there to pick up a full cargo hold of it


[14-Sep-22 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Its usually not a good idea to buy something in small number and add the full cost of fuel for the trip onto it


[14-Sep-22 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nunomer**:	I see.. thank you all for the useful information!

[19-Sep-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Sep-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	used to, problem is I collected way more than I needed (over a years worth) and shut the line down


[13-Feb-23 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	hehe


[13-Feb-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's one of those things you set up a building for a month then shut it down, there isn't that much demand for NE


[13-Feb-23 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, at least if your making AEFs that is, if your making LIT with it, sure, you can use a lot, but that is only used to build 1 high tier low use infrastructure building, so there isn't much demand for LIT

[01-Mar-23 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that is where you add NL production, it's quite valuable right now since LDE are in such high demand


[01-Mar-23 01:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I had to add a second WPL to try and keep up with demand, the fact I need most of the LDE for internal use, so I'm not satisfying's demand doesn't help

[01-Mar-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Is there a way we can be frens, even on the free tier?  I mean, I'm seeling SIO, NE and MCG, but if I knew a way to only sell to you first? at a price that you had first dibs as, couldn't we do it?


[01-Mar-23 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	NE for instance is selling is being asked for at 151, I could sell then next 40 units at 152 ensuring that you get it first....Is there any benefit in us working that deal out?


[01-Mar-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	considering that the lowest seller is asking over 360?


[01-Mar-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Lets be frens...


[01-Mar-23 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I'm new, I'm struggling, I have a collector, extractor, and a BMP.  If I could (on a free tier) only make stuff for you friens, I would, knowing that we are supporting the local community.


[01-Mar-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	There must be a way that us frens on Honshu can make a killing supporting each other despite being basic, free, or pro if we work together


[01-Mar-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**N0ma13**:	I'm not sure there's a way for a free tier to take direct contracts, however if you do one month of pro, you become basic tier forever which can accept contracts.

**stackem**:	Migration can be treated as ""from nowhere." There are things the governor can do with policoes and buildings to influence rentention/generation of workers.


[22-May-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stackem**:	I forget how it works now, but how it used to work is new construction would siphon workers proportionally from the various bases, and also lead to the planet being "more attractive" so immigration goes up


[22-May-23 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stackem**:	big maybe on all that. It's better for you to build so workers can come in, but it can drag the planet down a bit as a whole in the short term


[23-May-23 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Open Jobs attract new population


[23-May-23 07:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	or to be more precise: Happiness+open jobs drives immigration. If there are no open jobs then its just happiness and new population trickles in.


[23-May-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	If you plan on a big ramp up of your base, do it shortly before the POP report hits. if you look at last POPR you see that we had 500 open jobs which caused 1000 pio immigration


[23-May-23 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Zuul**:	Hello fellow residents. =)  A week late here, but I see there was some chatter about how migration works. Migration is simply Happiness - 70% of the existing population of that tier, and open jobs boosts happiness directly as a proportion of need fulfillment (can't exceed the happiness generated by need fulfilment). So if there are 21K PIO's, and the happiness is 95%, you'd get 25% of 21K as new PIO's.

[14-Jun-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ashless_**:	ok, last time i was online, put a new order in one of my basic materials plant to produce some resource (production template) now that order has completed and i'd like to sell transfer or something with that stuff i built, however i forgot what it was.


[14-Jun-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Jun-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ashless_**:	yep


[14-Jun-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	In that case, the only things you could have made with your starting materials is MCG or PE. (You can't look at previous production orders). So just look in your inventory for MCG or PE.

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a difficult start on this planet.

[24-Jun-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	MCG is a good product to make, and LST and SIO are both plentiful and cheap right now....if a bit heavy. I've gone out of my way to kick the price of PE down, but it's still profitable to make. So you could import some C and H as well and run both. That would make the logistics not insane


[24-Jun-23 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And keep an eye on the market for reasonably priced RCO. If you can bring in RCO for under 800, you can make decent profits on OVE's

[26-Jun-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I wouldn't call this a "difficult" start. Just takes a little extra work. Importing LST and making MCG is easy money, same for bringing in C and H and making PE. Digging out CLI and making I is always decent money too. Just make sure you don't wait until the last minute to pick up inputs. Keep your ships moving but keep them moving slowly. Minimize fuel expenditures by planning ahead as much as you can.

**WolfOfWalki**:	Hello there


[07-Jul-23 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	hi @WolfOfWalki I see your new, I'll give you the same advice that someone on this planet gives all new players that start here, this isn't a good new player planet, it's a decent planet as a 3rd to  6th planet, but as a starter planet, not great


[07-Jul-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	here is a spreadsheet that someone made (and keeps updated) on what starting planets are good for what https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUmjz8XNgLJ6y_XJa_hn7JPc9FWftqR2Lx9McZi-X-0/edit#gid=0

[07-Jul-23 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfOfWalki**:	Yes please... I read the handbook after starting (you know, like always) and read that it's quite hard to start here :D


[07-Jul-23 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfOfWalki**:	Does it make sense to have multiple accounts?


[07-Jul-23 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the planet has a manufacturing CoCG (chamber of global commerce) that makes all manufacturing jobs 25% faster, but manufacturing is not a particularly easy start overall, not bad, but it requires a lot of trading, and figuring out margins and the like, and the resources on the planet aren't great for anything else, the planet's value is how close to a CX (commodity exchange) it is, and that it is easy to settle, no special materials needed (all bars for gravity, pressure, temperature in the green)


[07-Jul-23 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	not allowed to multi account, the devs step on that one hard


[07-Jul-23 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	as you get to be an older player, you can do everything anyway if you want


[07-Jul-23 02:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and to reset, COLIQ lets you start again, choosing new starting package and planet as you want


[07-Jul-23 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfOfWalki**:	do these resets happen often nowadays?


[07-Jul-23 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	most new players need to reset at least once


[07-Jul-23 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	though it doesn't sound convincing coming from me, since I was one of the few at the time that didn't need to reset


[07-Jul-23 02:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	there is a cooldown on resets to prevent abuse of the system, but the devs made it an easily accessed feature for a reason


[07-Jul-23 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfOfWalki**:	I see... well, thank you for your help! I'll try to get my base up & running or will reset once I ran it into the ground :D


[07-Jul-23 02:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	you won't run it into the ground, it'll just be a lot slower (and this game is already very slow), but it is a good idea to try out things so you can get all the major mistakes out the way on a single reset (due to the cool down on COLIQ, it increases each time you use it)


[07-Jul-23 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a lot of people use this planet as the jury rigged planet that does a bit of everything, but not done on other planets because they are so good at what they specialize in it's not worth doing on them


[07-Jul-23 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfOfWalki**:	what's like the number one noob mistake (apart from choosing the wrong planet)?


[07-Jul-23 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	flying fast


[07-Jul-23 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	fuel cost money, flying fast very quickly scales up how much fuel you use with quickly diminishing returns


[07-Jul-23 02:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	forgetting to unload both starter ships of goods is another, and wondering why their workers aren't working


[07-Jul-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	otherwise, here is the FAQ, the players made it because I saw a lot of these questions in chat every 2-3 days before the FAQ was finished https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/faq/

[07-Jul-23 02:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I suggest a quick skim read of it when you have time (this game is slow, you'll have plenty)


[07-Jul-23 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	anyway, I have to go, I'll be back on later, if you have anymore questions, I suggest asking in global or help channels, there are usually a few long term players that check back frequently that will see your question before to long and can help out


[07-Jul-23 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WolfOfWalki**:	Alright, will do that! Thanks for your help!


[07-Jul-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	np, the game is about trading, and the more people that play the game, the more there are on the market, the more on the market, the more trading that happens, and the better the game is


[07-Jul-23 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	so long term players have an interest in you continuing to play the game


[07-Jul-23 03:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	just realized I should clarify one thing from my advice earlier if you see this, flying fast is the mistake, try to fly slow, almost minimum speed most of the time, you'll save lots of fuel, won't take much longer to get places, the saved fuel will save you a lot of money, letting you expand a lot faster

**Rento247**:	sheesh, same happened here as prom, as happiness is over 70%, but yet no growth spurt. What's up with that?


[11-Jul-23 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Because growth is (Happiness%-70)x existing population. 1.6% of 25K isn't a whole heck of a lot.


[11-Jul-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	oh is that how it works


[11-Jul-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	cool


[11-Jul-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	odes open jobs fall into that at all?


[11-Jul-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Open jobs provides a modifier to happiness, although it's capped to no more than the happiness provided by need fulfillment. So even a billion open jobs won't overcome a complete lack of upkeep.


[11-Jul-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	thanks i was being a bit dramatic i read and watched a few guides so I think I'll be fine. You can go do your thing don't worry. Thanks though, nice to meet a fellow space capitalist.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ok, I'm back. Can field any questions you have


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	what would be a nice thing to queue in my basic materials plant in terms of bang for my buck


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	i started with the constructor kit


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	so something to finance my future operations


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, when you start, you have the materials for making MCG and PE already in your ships


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Anything beyond that starter stuff you'll need to source the materials. I think what you start with will keep you running for 2 or 3 days.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Cool. Queued some MCG and also BBH in my prefab plant. Any tips on how to go forward and what to focus on


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	BBH in a prefab plant?


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	yes


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, did you go "constructor" as your profession?


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	yes


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Ewwwww


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	lol what


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So, you're about to run into a problem. The basic construction market at tier 1 tends to revolve around Iron (FE) and Limestone (LST), both are stupidly mass intensive. You can't source either locally and the CX is in another system. So logistics is going to become a SIGNIFIICANT issue moving forward due to the limits of how much you can pack into a starter ship on any given trip.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can target BDE manufacturing which takes PE (significantly easier to move), but you'd still want to diversify your output.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If I were you, I'd lean heavily into the manufacturing aspect (the BMP's) as you grow. This planet is specialized for manufacturing, the COGC (Chamber of Global Commerce) runs manufacturing here, so everything that's manufacturing gets a large efficiency bonus.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	I see


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Can't really produce PE yet though


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	I assume I should buy some H and C first


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes, or you can just outright buy PE from the CX.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Alright. I assume nothing gets teleported and I would need to go pick it up there.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Still cheaper to make it yourself, but you might be able to make more by producing a different product in your BMP and buying the PE. You'd have to work the math on that.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Absolutely correct.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Typically, the most common products are OVE (overalls, although RCO is an absolute pain in the ass to source right now), MCG, and PE. I just dropped a bomb on MCG pricing, but you can still make quite good money bringing back LST and SIO and making it.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Alright good to know.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	I think I'll produce what I can for now and by the time I get the hang of everything I'll analyze the market and see what's most profitable.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	EXO wouldn't be wretched either, bit of AL and some OVE's. PT would also be worthwhile, I know a couple people have started supplying the HRT CX with reasonably priced steel (STL), if you go that route make sure to pick up TRN to go with it, as the STL+TRN recipe is the best for making PT's with current pricing.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Could I ask how you get PG? In case I go with OVE


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	As in how you produce it


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Don't make OVE's with PG. That being said, it's a chemical process in a POL, C+H+MG


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	To find that out yourself, enter MAT PG into a buffer.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	MAT is for material, than the material code. You can do the same with buildings by entering BUI followed by the building code


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Ah very useful. Yeah doesn't seem viable


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Also, to be entirely honest, I've pretty much hammered the OVE market. You can still make money on the market as I haven't priced it down into unprofitability, but I'm pretty much putting a lid on the kind of prices that made making them exceedingly profitable.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	I'm just trying to make a living for now not become ultra rich so I think it should be fine.


[12-Jul-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	MCG is still a really good money maker though. That's another product I'm hammering the price down on, but even at 24/u it's over 3K profit/day on a BMP making it before you even figure in experts.


[12-Jul-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Alright I think I'll try to survive on MCG and BDE for now. Many thanks for the tips.


[12-Jul-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'd offer to play middleman for inputs and outputs and save you the CX trips while you're new, but players can't directly trade with free players. Until you pay in at least once, you're locked out of direct P2P trades


[12-Jul-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you wind up deciding you love the game and want to subscribe, let me know and I can play middleman. I run a ship in every day to tend to this base....I eat a silly amount of material with 42 BMP's screaming away, lol


[12-Jul-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Nice. Yes I was thinking of trying the game for a few weeks before I commit to the subscription. Hopefully I won't go bankrupt before that. Thanks again for the help.


[12-Jul-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You shouldn't. Rento (another major player, governor of Promitor) has pretty much committed to keeping SIO prices affordable at HRT, LST is pretty much readily available at good rates...and even if you somehow managed to flood the market, I'll buy up a virtually limitless amount of MCG at a price where you still make money. Just don't fly your ship super fast, gas prices can kill you. Recommend minimum fuel setting + 1 or 2 ticks when you fly. Also, COF and PWO are well worth it to bring in early. The luxuries make a big difference.


[12-Jul-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	HRT, by the way, is a system and CX trading station, the closest to this planet.


[12-Jul-23 03:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Delthor**:	Great to hear. Thanks. Gotta go now as soon as I set up a supply run.

**bazdakka**:	where is it stranded, you can fly another ship there with extra fuel to save it, or beg the devs to refuel it for you (they usually say yes though it takes a while)


[29-Jul-23 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	flying another ship only works if the ship is landed

**mcksycr**:	One ship is at HRT, the stranded one is at BS658a


[31-Jul-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you have no money, nothing at the CX to sell, no fuel on either ship, and a free account....I don't think there's any way out of that short of a COLIQ

**Shorewahtevs**:	I made a good 100k over a couple weeks doing that at Moria before I even touched down there


[01-Aug-23 01:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	That was starting witht the 1000 NCC that's given from the start


[01-Aug-23 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I'm guessing he is a return player, since both his name and company are over 200 days old, but he is still only on one planet, and given this kind of mistake, I'm assuming returning player who just spent all his money fixing up his buildings

**Id10t**:	i actually like the leaderboards... i'm gonna top cot and rco cause it is litterally all i do do... i do like it for the fact that it sorta tells how much of an item is being produced, even though score isn't directly a number


[01-Aug-23 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	look at governour section ...


[02-Aug-23 03:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, that is interesting, it's one that if you stay as governor, your position will almost never drop below what it is (could move up if someone above you stopped being governor) and you could be voted out, but if your already on high on that board, odds are you aren't losing a vote for governor easily


[02-Aug-23 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	hey thats our governor


[02-Aug-23 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yeah, he and Rubi were the two longest serving, but Rubi quit/vacationed a couple months back, so he's 2 terms back now.

[04-Aug-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	question, going forward, what are the possiblities of getting a small scientist population on the planet, wondering as I have a couple of scientist tier manufacturing buildings I'm looking at adding to my empire in the distant future, and wondering if it's possible to get them on the planet I have that matches the CoCG for them, I can get them elsewhere and just miss the CoCG bonus, but I'd like it if possible, and figured no harm in asking


[04-Aug-23 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean....who are you asking? We don't have a governor right now....or are at least going to not have one. Election has already started and no one is running. @Schaitir Election doesn't start in 11 hours, it "started" 11 hours ago, now 15h 45m ago.


[04-Aug-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's an open question really, kind of directed at @Gladi099 since I suspect he may end up running again, or whoever else puts their hand up to run if they don't


[04-Aug-23 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I don't mind to much if we can't get scientists here, as I said, the CoCG bonus was just a nice add on, I could just run the buildings on another planet that doesn't have the CoCG bonus and has a bit of spare space (though taking space from a chem base is painful, it's the only place I am planning in the near future that I could easily set these up on)


[04-Aug-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	i'm not couting gladi099 out until the fat lady sings :)


[04-Aug-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, that would certainly be ideal, lol


[04-Aug-23 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	election started 16 hours ago... but ends in 7 days so... still not worried


[04-Aug-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	How many SCI you need?0


[04-Aug-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	you also would want to build at least one level of Library and Art Gallery or their big counter parts.


[04-Aug-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	20, maybe 40 total


[04-Aug-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I can support the construction of the infrastructure buildings in question, just not sure what we would need


[04-Aug-23 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I can supply the fabs for them, and MCG and TRU, not sure about the electronics needed in them though


[04-Aug-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	we can try and see if 20 or 40 would stay without them


[04-Aug-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	getting them is now easy with immigration programs


[04-Aug-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	125k and 100 SCI pop up


[04-Aug-23 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	with the next POP report


[04-Aug-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	so you got less than 5 days to build your SCI production buildings, chop chop


[04-Aug-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	we can leave the POP infrastructure out for now and see how many run away the week after


[04-Aug-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	any larger amounts of SCI definitly need supporting infrastructure


[04-Aug-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	didn't need it that soon, it was a long term plan of what are the possiblities


[04-Aug-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and I haven't got the supporting infrastructure up yet, so don't get the scientists yet


[04-Aug-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If he already popped it, you could just drop the production building you plan to use and give no upkeep. You’d have to eat the loss from wear and tear, but for purposes of keeping them happy at the population level….they just need the workplace, not the upkeep.


[04-Aug-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	to late ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[04-Aug-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Would let you know well ahead of time if you need to build out supporting POPI then.


[04-Aug-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	yeah AAF needs Electronics


[04-Aug-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And that knowledge would likely be far cheaper than waiting until you actually want it and dropping POPI.


[04-Aug-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	yep


[04-Aug-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Or SPF - ship engines...


[04-Aug-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

**mcksycr**:	Just finished making 1000 PE


[04-Aug-23 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	will do, I'll figure out what I need to get here to get the building up, even if it is just taking up space in the mean time (was going to take some BMP down anyway, this is just ahead of schedule for a change)


[04-Aug-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	building will need a full repair by the time I eventually use it, I need 2 more bases (one of which I'm sending ship to set up now before I needed these buildings)


[04-Aug-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I can at least get one of them online as a test case, the second I was thinking of, meh, it can wait, I'll pay for another round of migration if I need it to get the population


[04-Aug-23 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	and the idea looks promising


[04-Aug-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-23 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	you could demolish the week after we see if they stay or not


[04-Aug-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Technically you'd need at least....oh....5 weeks, isn't it? Since you wouldn't hit a stabilization point until the rolling 5 week average had equalized.

**Rimp**:	oh ok


[11-Aug-23 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Aug-23 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	BTW the nearest CX is Hortus


[11-Aug-23 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Aug-23 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	to see how they are used in a production chain or in building buildings


[11-Aug-23 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	ok thx for info


[11-Aug-23 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	Np, feel free to ask away, most people are more than happy to answer and questions or help out as they can if they see you need help


[11-Aug-23 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	There's also the Official Apex Help Channel that is global and people are constantly asking and answering questions there too


[11-Aug-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	In this chat, its only people who have settled here so there might not be many people active


[11-Aug-23 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	if you can't find where that is located, you can open a new buffer and type "COMP HELP"


[11-Aug-23 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	and it'll link to that chat


[11-Aug-23 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	hmm ok


[11-Aug-23 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	I've learned like 90% of what I know from other players and there's also the handbook if you click the "help" tab in the upper right corner if you're shy lol


[11-Aug-23 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	if you ever see us use an acronym and aren't sure what it is, open a new buffer and use the BUI and MAT commands followed by the code in question, 95% of the time, that will find it, eg MAT RAT would find the information for 'material' 'Basic Rations' and BUI BMP finds the information for the 'building' 'Basic Materials Plant'


[11-Aug-23 03:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	ok thx


[11-Aug-23 03:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	the FAQ in the handbook is fairly good as well, covers a lot of common questions


[11-Aug-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	ok


[11-Aug-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	as to expansion and recommended buildings, that is on you, since prices change over time, what was good for other people may not be great for you due to price changes


[11-Aug-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	Also, imo this game is very slow, even at a handful of planets I find more of my time either theorycrafting production lines and planets and just overall learning in general


[11-Aug-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	that being said, a safe start for manufacturing here is mining SIO, buying LST from the CX, and making MCG


[11-Aug-23 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	so where how do i find which solar system is my planet base located in?


[11-Aug-23 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	highlight the toggle on the map for bases, and CX, since those 2 are actually useful, especially while learning the game for where things are


[11-Aug-23 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	of nevermindi found it


[11-Aug-23 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	HRT CX is the closest commodity exchange to this planet


[11-Aug-23 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	so where is it?


[11-Aug-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	it says ho commodity exchange


[11-Aug-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	no


[11-Aug-23 04:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	You can go to the actual Commodity Exchange by clicking on the CXL tab on the left and then clicked on the Hortus Station CX


[11-Aug-23 04:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shorewahtevs**:	That's like where you can see everything for sale, but to actually go there you have to use your ship by clicking "FLY" and then inputting "HRT" as the destination


[11-Aug-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rimp**:	ok thx


[11-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Also, as Shore has said: global help channel will be, well, more helpful than a planet chat: COMP HELP.

**bazdakka**:	right, I have the housing and building up to employ the scientists now, so you can moniter what effects just having them employeed will have on happiness, though the building isn't running yet, I'm working on getting that online ASAP so that I'm not burning cash, as I said earlier, I wasn't actually ready for this yet, I was a couple of months out, but I think I can get parts of the production online sooner, just poorly optimized until I'm more prepared

**Gladi099**:	once we hgave the next report you can demolish if you want - to conserv materials. as it will give us a little insight


[14-Aug-23 01:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I can probably go 2 reports before demolishing to get a more accurate measure without losing any of the mats that matter


[14-Aug-23 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	If there are not enough settlers for my new buildings does that mean I just need to wait for the next pop report? Or do I need to actually build all the things so that settlers will come?


[14-Aug-23 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	if you have your buildings rdy before the population report, you'll be among the first's in the line on snatching the fresh immigrants :3


[14-Aug-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	hmm, when is the next pop report?


[14-Aug-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	5 days, you can check by opening the previous one


[14-Aug-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's at the top of the info window for the planet if your on desktop


[14-Aug-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	2 days actually ;)


[14-Aug-23 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	is that 5 days since the last one? so 2 days?


[14-Aug-23 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	got it, i will make a note to build tomorrow then


[14-Aug-23 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	5 days since last one


[14-Aug-23 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, when I checked, I thought it was 5 till next, glad you asked, as otherwise I'd have been wrong


[14-Aug-23 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	to be fair, with out settler population, and the unemployment on the planet for them, you'll probably get full settlers if you built now


[14-Aug-23 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rento247**:	but still, last report had 22% unemployment, so I'm kinda surprised if there isn't enough settlers for you atm


[14-Aug-23 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	I only got 315 at most


[14-Aug-23 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	settlers


[14-Aug-23 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	No matter the unemployment, there's only so many that 1 person can take.


[14-Aug-23 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	10% of the available workforce, essentially.


[14-Aug-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So 22% of 1.4K is...well...you guessed it. Just over 300.


[14-Aug-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	oh, yeah, 315 is how many you can pull from the pool this week, but during the report, it'll fill all open jobs, this limit is to prevent 2 people trying to drop bases and the first taking all the unemployed workers in a single week, after that, you have the next most recent pop report to go off, in theory, you can decide if you want to full base drop in a single week


[14-Aug-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	does the 10% still apply if the jobs are waiting when the pop report still happens?


[14-Aug-23 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	No, it hands out EVERYTHING on the POPR


[14-Aug-23 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If there's enough workers when the POPR hits, every open job is supplied


[14-Aug-23 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	k


[14-Aug-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	the 10% rules is only for during reports


[14-Aug-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	at the time of report, pop will be distributed in round robin fashion equally.


[14-Aug-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	So Player A needs 500 settlers, Player B 350, Player C 100


[14-Aug-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	700 Settlers available


[14-Aug-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	first the system checks if there are enough settlers to hand out each player the least amount needed by a player


[14-Aug-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	so Round 1, the game each hands out 100 settlers to A, B and C


[14-Aug-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	then 2nd round only A and B need settlers still, Player A needs 400, Player B 250 - we have 400 left in the pool


[14-Aug-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Round 2 the game hands out 200 to Player A and B because thats the remaining pool split amongs the remaining players


[14-Aug-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	so that means that Player A has received 300 of 500, Player B 300 of 350, Player C 100 of 100


[14-Aug-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZekTheMad**:	I only need 210 more settlers for now, so that shouldn't be an issue next POPR I would think


[14-Aug-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Oh sure, was just explaining in general


[14-Aug-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The 10% is for between the reports, not during reports. 10% is the workforce reserve pool. 25% is what is "supposed" to get returned to the worker pool on the POPR for the round robin distribution when it works and doesn't bug out.


[14-Aug-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	To clarify, the last POPR we had 13,952 settlers. We had an unemployment of 22.1%, or 3083 unemployed settlers. We also had a positive change of 80, so at the end of the POPR we had 3163 unemployed settlers. So, for the period between POPR's the available reserve worker pool for any given player is 316 settlers (10% of 3163).


[14-Aug-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For "during" the POPR, the rule is 25%, but not in that way. Assuming the game doesn't have a stroke, 25% of every bases workers go back to the pool for that round robin distribution system. Frankly, it hardly ever works that I've seen from being on planets where there aren't even workers to go around at the POPR.


[14-Aug-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	aren't enough, that is


[14-Aug-23 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Wow you guys got deep into the technical part of this game, I'm just trying to keep my production lines running and profitable.  Are we working together at all btw?  Like can I be contributing to something more than just what I'm doing by myself?  Im not talking about a corporation or anything


[14-Aug-23 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Can you, yes. Are you here? No. Pretty much anywhere that has a governor, they take care of everything having to do with communal upkeep for the planet.   ...or they're supposed to anyhow. Every once and awhile someone falls down on the job and the local players have to pick up the slack, but that's a governor whose soon to be delivered to the wood chipper though.


[14-Aug-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	So does the gov need me to contribute?  Like is there something I could be manufacturing that would make me money but also benefit the community?


[14-Aug-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I'm just making MCGs and selling at HRT... seems pointless


[14-Aug-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	testing out my skills making REP and seeing if I can make a bit more profit


[14-Aug-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Consider the community you're helping out to be the greater community around HRT. That's what I've made my long term goal.


[14-Aug-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	interesting, where do I learn what the current initiatives are so I know how to best contribute?


[14-Aug-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	And producing and delivering MCG helps out. As a new player, you obviously wouldn't have the historical knowledge of just how LONG MCG was pegged to the upper market maker band at HRT. It's taken a lot of concentrated grinding to get the prices down.


[14-Aug-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	is that the goal? to reduce prices?


[14-Aug-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There really...aren't any. Look at the market, find holes. Fill those holes.


[14-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	For example, I make it a point to try and keep the market stocked with affordable STL and TRN to enable people to produce PT here at good rates. That's a benefit to our area.


[14-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	hmm... ok that makes sense


[14-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'm kind of falling down on the STL part right now since my smelters got diverted into making CU/AU for some electronics runs...but I'll get those volumes back up again soon.


[14-Aug-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	someone needs to tackle COF...


[14-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	COF is already WAY down


[14-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	at 500 a pop?


[14-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	insane


[14-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	The last time I did the numbers for "is it worth it" on one of my bases, the break even point where it started to become not worth it was 1200/u or so


[14-Aug-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Look at the 180d chart on COF and you'll see what I mean.


[14-Aug-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Honestly, the COF market is very healthy. I don't even bother listing anymore waiting for some helmet with too much money to buy out the market and relist. Got up to 5 figures of COF stockpiled now, lol


[14-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	if you're making STL, you're pretty much buying everything off world, bringing it in and making STL, then sending it back to HRT to sell.  Is there any real point in me trying to EXT, COL stuff from this place?  Or should I focus on buying stuff and putting it together?


[14-Aug-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I guess the resources here are just sort of starter resources for noobs to get established?


[14-Aug-23 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Oh, you definitely wouldn't make STL "here". I'm all over.


[14-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	ah, well that makes sense


[14-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	So whats the ideal setup here on this planet for a noob to make the most so I can start to expand


[14-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I'll get back to you in awhile if you're still around. I needed to pick up dinner 5 minutes ago, lol


[14-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	MCG and Iodine?


[14-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	ok


[14-Aug-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	@Mcksycr Finally back. I'd stay away from I. While it's easy to make here, HRT is also relatively low price and relatively low volume. I'd start by making PT/REP/MCG/PE/PWO. They all have decent returns, and by diversifying you insulate yourself from market spikes and make it easier to afford listing your goods for sale instead of selling to bids (exposure to more markets means more opportunity for quick sales).


[14-Aug-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You can add an EXT if you want. If you were a developed player with ample shipping, I'd say absolutely not, the opportunity cost would be fairly steep for nearly no financial improvement.


[14-Aug-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	As a new player though, the modest reduction in import requirements will ease your logistics load while operating with just starter ships.


[14-Aug-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Ok cool, I just stood up another BMP, so I'm making MCG and REP right now.  I'll start working on the others to help diversify.  I was looking at adding more EXT but I'll hold off.  Any good returns on NE?


[14-Aug-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you require direct assistance, feel free to contact me privately. I often make it a point to help new players, but I usually only advertise such on Prom. This isn't usually where new players start so I don't advertise here.


[14-Aug-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not particularly, no. The deposit here is fairly anemic.


[14-Aug-23 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's not an actual cash loss to make the stuff here, but it's pretty damn close to a wash...so no reason to really do it since it would take up space where you could host profitable industry.


[14-Aug-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	so you're saying I might add some EXT for exporting CLI and SIO?  Sell what I don't use at HRT?


[14-Aug-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	More just making SIO to use in the MCG manufacturing process, which would reduce the amount you need to import.


[14-Aug-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Manufacturing tends to be heavy on the import side. So a reduction in the import side of the equation directly equates to less trips to the CX.


[14-Aug-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	So not EXT for exporting raw stuff.  No real money in it?


[14-Aug-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Frankly, you'll only need 1 or 2 EXT's unless you go "really" heavy on MCG production, and then you're going to be stressing yourself logistics on importing LST.


[14-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I only have 1 right now for SIO, and I'm making more REP than MCG.  I almost feel like the MCG is paying for me to make REP


[14-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Not really, no. SIO is almost a wash at current prices, you'd just be making it to ease logistics. CLI could turn a profit....but less than manufacturing. So if you're making more SIO then you need you could export some CLI.


[14-Aug-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	HRT has the lowest CLI prices in the galaxy...so....yeah. If you want to ship it up to MOR you could make some money, but selling locally it's a turd.


[14-Aug-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	dang, will it be worth it with fuel costs?


[14-Aug-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Uhhh....lemme look


[14-Aug-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yes


[14-Aug-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	another question, how do you gauge what to buy for fuel,   seems like right now I'm just guessing


[14-Aug-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	What do you mean what to buy for fuel?


[14-Aug-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	keeping fuel on hand to refuel ships


[14-Aug-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I feel like I'm sort of guessing


[14-Aug-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	keeping reserves on inventory


[14-Aug-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	do you have any rule of thumb for keeping ships fueled


[14-Aug-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, just buy some at the CX and hold it in the warehouse there. You'd have to do something "really" stupid to run out of fuel here.


[14-Aug-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	lol... I've done it


[14-Aug-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I refuel everytime I hit the CX. There's no reason to let your tanks drop.


[14-Aug-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There's no flight profile improvement, it doesn't care what's in the tanks. You're paying the mass/volume tax on the tank itself, not the fuel in it.


[14-Aug-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	so just fill er up when you hit the CX


[14-Aug-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	If you can afford to have a couple bucks tied up, put in a small bid for fuel. That way you can save a few pennies if someone fills it.


[14-Aug-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	ok, I might set up an EXT for CLI to sell at MOR to try and earn a few extra pennies


[14-Aug-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I keep 10K+ of each fuel at the CX at any given time, but that's probably more than you'd want to keep lying around =)


[14-Aug-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	So submit a low bid and just let it sit.... that makes sense


[14-Aug-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I can't wait til I can afford to do that


[14-Aug-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I mean, not "low", just...not the ask. I usually list a bid at 12.5 for SF on HRT, fills relatively regularly.


[14-Aug-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	So for you, maybe throw in for a couple hundred units at 12.5. If it fills before you hit the CX next, you save some money putting the gas in your tank.


[14-Aug-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	should I do the same for selling stuff?  I mean if I'm not in a pinch?


[14-Aug-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's a more difficult question as a new player. You want to be constantly reinvesting when you're new. Each new building is a huge profit boost to you. So letting goods sit to get a bit more money can hurt more than it can harm from the opportunity cost of not having that liquid cash NOW.


[14-Aug-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It depends on the spread though, and if the bid is actually allowing you to turn a profit.


[14-Aug-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	ok thats fair


[14-Aug-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Aug-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	by the way how did you do that quick analysis on if selling CLI at MOR was worth the fuel.  I haven't seen a way to sort of forecast fuel consumption


[14-Aug-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I didn't even check against fuel consumption.


[14-Aug-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I checked against the cost to have a 3rd party ship it for you.


[14-Aug-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	like a contract?


[14-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Pulling from memory since I deleted the math. Think you can put 204 units in a starter ship. 10K is a fair price to ship CX to CX. So just under 50 bucks per unit.


[14-Aug-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You'd make At LEAST an extra 90 per unit shipping it up to MOR. So, having it sent would net you more money.


[14-Aug-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I'm not sure I understand having it sent.  Do I list it on the CX, wait for it to sell, then create a contract for someone to deliver it for me?


[14-Aug-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	There are shipping contracts. So you'd move the product to HRT. Then, on HRT, you'd create a contract to move the product from HRT to MOR. Someone accepts the contract, takes your product, flies it to MOR, unloads it into your inventory there and you pay them.


[14-Aug-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	You "could" create a contract direct from here...but there'd be much less traffic from here to MOR, so the chance of it being taken is low.


[14-Aug-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Ah, so now how do I get inventory there? is that a building?


[14-Aug-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Rent a warehouse on the CX


[14-Aug-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Or 100 of them, whatever =)


[14-Aug-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	lol thats a thing?


[14-Aug-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's what I meant by storing fuel at the CX.


[14-Aug-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I thought you meant buy it but don't pick it up til you need it


[14-Aug-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	CX warehousing is relatively cheap. I keep 110 warehouses on HRT right now. So 55K t/m3 of storage.


[14-Aug-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I have done that before, never had to rent space


[14-Aug-23 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Have about 10K each on ANT/MOR


[14-Aug-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	hmm.. ok.  didnt know that was a thing


[14-Aug-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Yup. You don't actually need it when you start. It would just let you buy something and then immediately turn around and resell it.


[14-Aug-23 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	so where does the 10k from CX to CX come from


[14-Aug-23 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	That's just the quick rule of thumb I use for fair shipping rates for a full starter ship from CX to CX. You can probably get it moved for less, 7 or 8K, but it won't move as fast.


[14-Aug-23 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Well, adjacent CX to CX, the cross core CX routes I usually say 12 or 13K


[14-Aug-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	how do you make that calculation though, is it the cost in fuel to fly there and back and be able to refuel 100%?


[14-Aug-23 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	It's the fuel cost to fly there, plus what I consider to be a fair payment per day of shiptime. I can't even remember what the hell I used initially when I figured it. 5K per shipday maybe?


[14-Aug-23 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	ok.... good info, thanks.  I think I can step up my game now

**bazdakka**:	it should be noted, that as a new player, instead of using a shipping contract, you'd ship it yourself, but 10K per trip is what you'd pay someone to ship it CX to CX (assuming full cargo hold), and long term you may consider that, the overall goal of the game is a sandbox, set a goal you want to achieve, and work towards it, you don't need to pick one early on


[15-Aug-23 03:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	early on, just getting a functional plan up and running is enough effort while you learn the game


[15-Aug-23 03:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	a good way to see what is needed the most is where the best profit margins are, if there is a big disconnect between cost to produce something and it's price, it usually means there is a shortage of it (note, higher tiers have a larger difference in cost to produce to price), so sometimes just picking things that make the most money can be the best way to help the universe, as every extra producer of a good brings the price down slightly, while every extra user of a good brings the price up slightly, some items 1 person is only a drop in the bucket (eg RAT, you'd need more than 1 full base to have a noticeable effect on that price), others, each person is massive as the markets for those goods are smaller

**Zuul**:	Also, since I was getting into the technical bits, here's a good example of how the population redistribution is broken. POPR OF-443b. I had been the sole employer of Settlers on the planet. Last week there were 383 Settlers before the POPR, I employed 330, giving the displayed unemployment of 13.8%, after the 15 unit loss, there was 368 left at the end of the POPR. For this week, new people moved in and employed settlers. 52 new settlers showed up, with the 23 left from the prior week, that meant there was 75 total settlers available. Each of the new arrivals took 2 settlers (10% reserve pool) when they set up, so 71 settlers available for the POPR. If the redistribution worked as intended, I'd have sent 25% back to the pool, or about 83 settlers, with the 71 available, that would make 154 settlers for round robin style, 3 players needing them, and I, myself, needing 83 to have full employment. Obviously with only 154 workers being split 3 ways....I'm not getting 83.


[15-Aug-23 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	I wouldn't even get it if it were being split 2 ways.....and yet, I'm still at 330 settlers, full employment. So, just a lesson. Even knowing how the game is "supposed" to work doesn't actually mean you know how it IS going to work under the table....because things are just plain broken.


[15-Aug-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Anyone have 40 SIO I can purchase? I'm gonna have one BMP down for a day if I can't get some.  And flying to HRT and back won't make sense.

[16-Aug-23 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	well, looks like just employing the scientists isn't enough to keep them from leaving...


[16-Aug-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Nope, if you want to bleed out, you'd need 100% fulfillment of safety, health, and comfort, plus a handful of open jobs.


[16-Aug-23 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	erm, no bleed out


[16-Aug-23 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	In the absence of culture and education, that is


[16-Aug-23 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yeah, I'll think about what advance building is a better way to do this as part of infrastructure


[16-Aug-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	could go with a Planetary Broadcasting Hub and run it with OFF only


[16-Aug-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zuul**:	Problem is that's only 166 points of each, and even if every person on the planet was just a pioneer, they'd need about 1400 and 900 respectively. With about a 3rd of the pop being settlers, increase that by maybe 50%. So you'd only be hitting ~10% fulfillment of each. So maybe a 5% bump to SCI happiness. Could probably pull it off with 3 or 4 of them, or 2 with 2 materials filled.


[16-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**bazdakka**:	so PF3 is almost enough to keep scientists here, from the looks of this report, though that is an expensive way to achieve that goal imo, though it could discount any other parts of it, at least as long as I keep them employed that is. since I'm not ready for them yet anyway, I'll think I'll take the building down for now, leave the housing, and when I'm closer to being ready, I'll set up a higher tier infrastructure building to try and keep them happy, between that and jobs, I think that will mostly be enough

[11-Sep-23 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	yes, early on, you want to reinvest everything you can, run tight margins (not so tight you stall production due to being unable to pay taxes though), since you are only running one base, the mental load of doing that isn't that high, later on, the mental effort to min max to that level increases to the point where you go stuff it, 100 of this, that should last a couple of weeks, now what to do with the rest of the cash I have sitting around

**Mr.McSquiggy**:	Do my fleets have to be in a commodity exchane system before I can purchase mats?


[29-Sep-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	There must be some sort of cargo hold at the CX before you can buy something. Ship have a cargo hold, but you can also rent Warehouse space at the CX.

**bazdakka**:	you don't need cargo space at CX, if you buy something and have no space for it, it sits in a contract (CONT in a new buffer), until you can pick it up, however, you can't do any relist methods with things sitting in contracts, eg, list the item for sale again (aka day trading), or cancel a sell order to lower the price

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a challenging and slow start on this planet.

[28-Nov-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	haha nice, a bit of extra storage really helps a lot


[28-Nov-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	What do Ag and Food Efficiencies really gain me by upgrading my HQ?  This planet isn't good for Farming, so Ag isn't a major help, and making food?


[28-Nov-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I'm sort of wondering why even upgrade here


[28-Nov-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	In that case your only reason for upgrading is to get more permits to either expand your current base or start new ones on other planets. The Ag and food efficiency increase go back down when you use up your permits. Mine is 6% Ag and 4% Food indu even though I have HQ lvl 14


[28-Nov-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Basically, let's say you are on a good agri planet, you could upgrade your hq many times and your farms would become more and more efficient. Or you can use your permits to build several bases instead


[28-Nov-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	In the long run you'll start a new base somewhere else and relocate HQ there to get the exact bonus you need. More info in COMP HELP.


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	So those efficiencies follow you off planet?


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Yes it will


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Well in that case upgrade away


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Still, if you use your HQ upgrades to build new bases, the bonus will not increase


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	From the wiki: "Multiplier = -2 * (UsedPermits / TotalPermits) + 3" Meaning your bonus multiplier


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	so if your used permits = your total permits the bonus stays the same


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	after 3 glasses of whiskey that sounds like Chinese. I'll have to revisit this conv tomorrow


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	hahaha


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	just upgrade hq and get more bases, this is the way


[28-Nov-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a challenging and slow start on this planet.

[22-Dec-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	Also I threw up some DW and RAT's for a bit cheaper then at HRT if anyone needs it. From now on when I do my wekkly top up I'll bring extras to trade

**mcksycr**:	I sent two ships to HRT this morning for this stuff... had I known


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	I don't buy cof myself tbh, rates are meh for consumption. As for PWO's, I was actually hoping to contract someone here to make them


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Oh I might be interested in doing that


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I was making them for a little bit


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	I produce COT on world and need PWO myself, so instead of setting up my own BMP my plan was to get someone here to make it with my materials


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	sounds interesting, I might be able to swing that


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	are you producing PG too?


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	I cam also sell some of the RCO I have that can be made into OVE, not yet, but a corp mate is so get a discount from that


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	So you provide the COT, and I provision PG?  Then just sell it local?


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	Oh I have a large stockpile of PG, I tend to buy like 3000 at a time, so I could quick a few hundred to get production started until you start shipping some in


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	I only need like 20 PWO's for a month or something, so one set covers me. After that anymore you produce you can sell on the LM or up at HRT


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I'm game, I have a stop in the queue opening in 8 hours and 50 minutes if you want me to throw it in


[22-Dec-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	Right now running through my NL production, in 4 hours my COT will start and that takes 6 and a half hours, so will be a bits

**mcksycr**:	The spreadsheets do lie because they only allow you to calculate prices based on one selection, you can set it to ask, bid, average, or some other permutation of the same thing.  Now it uses all the prices based on that one selection.  If you buy at the bid price, and think you are selling at the bid price and project a profit, you will be wrong every time, just like if you think you're gonna buy at the ask price and sell at the ask price


[20-Jan-24 07:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I made my spreadsheet to assume I will always buy at the bid price, and projects what my gains (if any) will be at the ask price.  I then pick the product with the highest return based on the ask price.


[20-Jan-24 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I think this method guarantees a positive return especially since you don't usually have to settle at selling at the ask price, but if you have to, you still win


[20-Jan-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I think that's the only strategy that's both sane and simple.


[20-Jan-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	I bought materials for producing 5000 MG a while ago, and as long as I sell at $73 my projecting profit will be $159K.  Current ask price is $133 so I have been sitting pretty for a while


[20-Jan-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mcksycr**:	Sorry I mean the bid price is $136, so even better

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a challenging and slow start on this planet.


[31-Jan-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**meatray**:	About to build my second manufacturing building after nearly three weeks. :weary:


[31-Jan-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MAJORNUKE**:	What's the biggest problem for new players on this planet?


[02-Feb-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	That you can't extract anything here. Manufacturing business is essentially transforming goods from multiple sources into some final products, and new players have to buy all source materials, so there's very little room for them to make savings.


[02-Feb-24 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Compare to agri start, where you usually extract your own water, or metallurgist, where you extract your own ore.


[02-Feb-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	I was thinking of offering cheap transport to new players, but my ships don't go past here often enough to make a real dent probably. I'll still try to offer it when I can though.


[02-Feb-24 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Because when I go out here I usually have like 90-95% free space in my cargo, and when I go back it's often above 50% free space


[02-Feb-24 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	IMO manufacturing isn't very logistics-heavy. My Excel says I could visit this planet once per ~13.3 days, while my Berthier-Adalina complex required a dedicated ship to handle.


[02-Feb-24 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	It's mainly tough due to the heavy import start and being so far from CX, and not having a ton of money to go around at start


[02-Feb-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Financing might be the best way to kickoff in maufacturing then


[02-Feb-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Uh, what do you mean "habs and CM"? I thought it was the bases that provide Life Support, and at 50 points per base it doesn't take a huge pop to outgrow that (~15k pioneers at our ~75 bases).


[13-Feb-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	Habitats increase life support as well on planets that dont have natural life support (like promitor)

[13-Feb-24 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Feb-24 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Huh, interesting. PCT guide at https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/ only says "The habitations on those bases also provide life support." and that's literally all it says on the subject.

[13-Feb-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Haha yeah makes sense to not look into that but I guess 30% unemployment should be enough to challenge the concept that there will be always enough habs to cover it :P

[21-Feb-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	"Sucks" is a hard word, everybody demonizes Nova a lot. It's not super bad, but nothing compares to Promitor.


[21-Feb-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	You can get prosperous from any start. I started on OF-375b and it was slow (arguably, Nova will be even slower) but I got somewhere. But Promitor style is a whole another level.


[21-Feb-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iconicbensz**:	yeah bro just started no idea what is happening since I opened the game


[21-Feb-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Iconicbensz**:	im guessing to craft items it takes 5 days which is kinda long


[21-Feb-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	5 days is too long and sounds like you're doing something wrong. But this kind of stuff should be discussed in COMP HELP rather than local chats.

**J.Farragut**:	Would you all say it would be useful to manufacture fuel on Nova? I've gotten mixed information from the chat. Would people buy it here locally?


[29-Feb-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	Mixed information from the help chat, I mean.


[29-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	Do you plan on getting Pro at all?


[29-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	I'm on the fence currently.


[29-Feb-24 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	Without it you won't be able to sell locally. So making it here would be no different then making it on Prom. Both cases you'd have to sell it at the CX


[29-Feb-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Makin fuel here on Nova would probably be far from ideal. If you plan to use the Ammonia deposit on BS-788 f (in this system), it is a wery low yield deposit and will probably not give you enough ammonia to work with.


[29-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	A planet like Odysseus in VH-331 has both H and AMM for fuel, you just have to buy the GAL rocks.


[29-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	Is Odysseus a starting planet?


[29-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	I think you can start on any planet (don't know for sure).


[29-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	the only problem with odysseus as a new player is that you need InsuFoam for all your buildings, which add a lot to the building cost


[29-Feb-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	True, but at least that means not many other people have jumped on it yet


[29-Feb-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	That is true, you can fly your first ship loaded with building materials there and settle. But if you plan to do that use Prunplanner to figure out how much INS you'll need


[29-Feb-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	I think I may try for that. Thank you for all the advice


[29-Feb-24 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	Good luck!


[29-Feb-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	I think I'll give this game a few more days. If I get a handle on it and go PRO, expect to see some low cost local fueling.


[29-Feb-24 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MAJORNUKE**:	J.Farragut I forgot to mention, Odysseus also needs Aerostat foundations for its buildings, further adding to the cost


[29-Feb-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	I noticed. That's alright though. I'm apparently going to make a killing refining fuel here if I'm doing my math correctly. I'm getting nearly double what I'm paying in materials. If I can get established on Odysseus, it'll get even better.


[29-Feb-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Do factor the logistics of shipping things around in. No use if you make a killing but you get killed with shipping problems


[29-Feb-24 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	That's true. It's a good thing I'm making fuel, so the big main cost is negligable.


[29-Feb-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	I can just turn the engines down and wait things out without much worry, I think.


[29-Feb-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	Now my problem is getting the capital together to build a second refinery so I can speed up production. I'm flush with materials but it's agonizingly slow to get them wrapped up.


[01-Mar-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a challenging and slow start on this planet.

**Gladi099**:	Tax rates (PIO/SET/TEC/ENG/SCI right now are 10/40/80/500/1000

[15-Apr-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a challenging and slow start on this planet.


[23-Apr-24 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127

**rutkre**:	and no, i havent rented a warehouse either


[26-Apr-24 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	If this link doesn't answer it for you, let's continue this in the COMP HELP channel :)


[26-Apr-24 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rutkre**:	i see them in the contracts now, but i cant receive them


[26-Apr-24 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rutkre**:	'condition currently cannot be fullfilled'


[26-Apr-24 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	What's the size of the whole order?


[26-Apr-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	Cause it's likely larger then the ship so you can't retrieve it


[26-Apr-24 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rutkre**:	ah makes sense, i understand now


[26-Apr-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LordCT**:	Sadly atm there is no way to split a shipment/package so if it's too large you need to rent a warehouse, let it unpack into there and then take what you can fit


[26-Apr-24 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gladi099**:	Update on the Tax front: the tax income now covers COGC and POPI at market rates. This means that once the Politics Update is released, the Goverment will issue contracts for anyone to supply materials to these infrastructures, at roughly market rates. Looking forward to all that and how it works and how it will be setup.

**Gladi099**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ away from Nova Honshu and start either on Montem or Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a challenging and slow start on this planet.

[05-Jul-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	Definitely agree with Gladi on that, Promitor is an oasis you can only settle on if you start there, and it also helps transition into things like manufacturing, food, and even Carbon and other industries. Nova Honshu does make a great expansion, though!


[05-Jul-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Aug-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	More production lines come from more buildings.  Also, sometimes the contracts from Insitor don't have deadlines, sometimes they do.... just a piece of some randomness.  Same goes for the space exploration contracts, but I highly recommend rarely if ever getting those exploration ones because they tend to not be worth the cost of fuel to do them, unless you happen to be flying through it on a way to somewhere else

**Atrium**:	I was premature on adding a BMP exactly because of the increased consumption.  Build a buffer, then the increase in production will ramp up to allow for more purchases.


[06-Aug-24 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	Yeah, at the start it's definitely a slow and steady type situation.  Normally the recommendation is to consider restarting and to start at Promitor, since it's impossible to open a base there later, only option is to start on there.  Then can always expand later to Honshu

**MoonSugarTravels**:	From a quick look at our POPI and back of the envelope calculations, upping the PAR upkeep to 4/5 consumables (at all other buildings kept at today's levels) should yield ~55% happiness for a population of 40 engineers - correct me if I'm wrong.


[20-Aug-24 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It would get sucked up by all the lower tier but higher number pops first before they contributed to ENG population


[21-Aug-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Not sure what you mean by "before they contributed to eng pop". I was thinking about immigrating them here, not growing them from techs. For 34k pioneers, 25k settlers, 550 techs and 100 engineers, the combined need for comfort is ~3100, so a 4/5 mat PAR would cover ~65%. All else the same, that's 55.decimals% happiness for engineers. What's wrong with this logic?


[21-Aug-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'll only have time to look into it during the weekends. That okay for you?


[21-Aug-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Sure, thanks. It's probably gonna be a couple of weeks until I build this new pipeline; I'm just checking my options for now.

**Procur**:	Hortus space hurts a bit for actually producing it. Most comes out of MOR area

**Procur**:	There's a few good sites to help explore/find different planets. https://prunplanner.org/ is nice for finding specific types of planets you may want to settle on and plan them

[29-Aug-24 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	But usually to start if you need a lil Iron, probably going to want to buy it from the CX, just may not be particularly profitable.

**Gladi099**:	interesting running sst with all materials - is it worth it? SUN always seemed expensive


[30-Aug-24 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	and level 4 with just DW cheaper - could have changed


[30-Aug-24 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	also putting the DEC into the POPI hurt my hearth.... that was not worth it - imho - DEC only for building POPI


[30-Aug-24 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gladi099**:	like ART gallery etc


[30-Aug-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	We ended up reducing the active counts based on some calculations @--SCHAITR-- did so we can purge some of the unemployed


[30-Aug-24 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	And we'll be adjusting to 2/1/1 for consumable counts once they are done being consumed, I had goofed on the deposit of DEC early


[30-Aug-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	We want to cull a bit of the PIO/SET population


[30-Aug-24 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Procur**:	Hey everyone, welcome to PrUn. Head over to General Chat or/and Help Chat. Folks will be able to help you quickly if you have questions. Personally I recommend to COLIQ(restart your company) away from Nova Honshu and start on Promitor. Even if its full, you, as a new player, can still start there. If you decide to stay here look into SIO or CLI Extraction as well as Construction and Manufacturing. But it is a challenging and slow start on this planet.

**erasmus_**:	Its a busy sorta place


[20-Dec-24 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	Hey, welcome! Yeah, Honshu is a bit of a quiet place.  It can be a bit of a slow/hard start on this planet with the Manufacturing route.  I would likely recommend to "COLIQ" command which restarts your company and consider starting on a planet like Promitor.  Promitor is technically a full planet, however you can always create your first company base there.  If you don't, you'll likely never be able to have a base on it.  It's in my (and likely many others) opinion that starting there as a farming and food production base very efficiently, and there's lots of people there constantly helping.  Also, definitely recommend chatting in the main Apex chat for help with anything since many more people will see it!  Either way, welcome to PrUn!


[20-Dec-24 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erasmus_**:	I started on Berthier, and I thought Promitor would be a cool next move. Then I found out it was full. Sad face

[13-Feb-25 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**erasmus_**:	if you use command pli {planet identifier} There should be a build base button near the bottom. You need to have an inventory there (ship or warehouse) with the required materials to build it. If you click it it will show you what materials you need to build it. Also check out prunplanner if you haven't already, it can help you plan out bases.

**J.Farragut**:	I seem to be 100 pioneers short. Is there any way for me to fix that?


[28-Mar-25 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	I have the facilities for them.


[28-Mar-25 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	When did you build new buildings, and how many PIOs did you need in total?


[28-Mar-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	About 2 days ago, and 91 PIOs.


[28-Mar-25 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	I see the little figure in parenthesis saying I will get (9) PIOs, whenever they distribute them.


[28-Mar-25 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	Or for the total, Id have a total of 580 at full employment.


[28-Mar-25 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Alright we'll a program so you won't be short the next POPR, and also to build a small buffer


[28-Mar-25 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**J.Farragut**:	Is anyone interested in buying 1,000 ICA worth of OVE? I have to sort out a contract payment.


[03-Apr-25 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**J.Farragut**:	Actually, 2k worth. I've put up a sale on the local market. 100 ICA apiece is a better deal than you'll get at Hortus.


[03-Apr-25 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Qirono**:	done

**FinnKerr**:	@Procur @--SCHAITR-- whom do you want us to vote for this time between the two of you?


[10-Apr-25 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Procur**:	I'll be handling upkeep regardless.  I missed the last vote/gvmt stuff while I was out of country for a couple weeks so SCHAITR covered, but even if I'm not Governor by vote I'll end up handling Governor duties regardless


[10-Apr-25 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	I'll vote for you because you've done a good job and are incumbent :p


[10-Apr-25 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Please vote for Procur
