**Archiel**:	Thank you all for your support on ISA. I am happy to serve alongside our Governor Harpercz of FICSIT. OOG and FICSIT have a long history of cooperation with the development of Thalassa and the system is truly one of the great success stories in ANT space.

[13-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	i make C here and Phobos for now, 5 INC here and 5 on Phobos still


[13-Aug-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harpercz**:	Thalasa D is for C making)) but expensive for new acc


[14-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	I make a lot of C?


[14-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	I did pretty good maragins and didnt waste money


[14-Aug-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	But that being said, it did cost a lil over 500K for me to make this base, so i guess for an acc as new as mine, that is exp lol


[14-Aug-24 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	@rahzo - I think Nascent is the usual choice for burning C, since it doesnâ€™t require any special materials. But I assume you built a base here for H2O extraction as well as burning C?


[14-Aug-24 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	Not that weâ€™re not happy to have you here on ISA. Just seems like an expensive choice if all youâ€™re doing here is C and nothing else :D


[14-Aug-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	I am extracting as well lol.


[16-Aug-24 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	Would anybody buy C on planet? I usually sell my surplus on LM for a lil below market? Would C be something people would buy here? or Just not even worry about it? Or just do it anyway and make it a thing lol

**BooKliko**:	Oh gosh, @komalarn, did not meen to ignore you! Simply did not look at chat all this time. thanks for the welcome o/


[23-Oct-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	@Kahetabi we are peaceful here, don't get any ideas :D

[23-Oct-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	How is everybody doing with storage? Would you guys want a Warehouse upgrade for additional unit? There are plenty of funds available


[23-Oct-24 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Also, if you contribute towards planetary projects, don't be afraid to ask for reimbursement


[23-Oct-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	well i didn't really ask beforehand if y'all wanted to spend taxes on it, kinda just imposed it lmao


[23-Oct-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	but i won't say no to money shrug


[23-Oct-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	the 4 levels come out to ~1.4mil at AI1 ASK. so maybe just 1mil would be appropriate?


[24-Oct-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	nah, 1.4mil is appropriate.


[24-Oct-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	well "selling" all that to the planet gov at AI1 ASK feels like a bit of a ripoff


[24-Oct-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i think a discount is warranted


[24-Oct-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	or possibly more of a discount, idk what the gov's tax situation is like


[24-Oct-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Komalarn**:	Yeah, the market price is kinda high and IS is not THAT rich :D


[24-Oct-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Oct-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	jvaler is an upstanding citizen and any money  you send her will likely go to the ADI grants, so sending 1.4m is totally appropriate :D

**Komalarn**:	Again thanks @jvaler for the contribution


[31-Oct-24 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Dec-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**BooKliko**:	Welcome @Garoo and @Appletree23 ! There should be enough PIO available (2290) for your initial build. Let me know what you plans are so I know what to boost. It is good to know that the next POP report is in 14.5 h from now. Thus, make sure you build just before the POP report, so all the jobs get filled as soon as the report comes out.


[08-Feb-25 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-25 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-25 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	did get my base built before the pop report though so its working nicely


[09-Feb-25 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	Fantastic!


[09-Feb-25 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	It looks like someone removed a bunch of production. Thus bigger PIO buffer present


[09-Feb-25 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	oh nice


[09-Feb-25 02:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	im planning to expand my base a bunch in the coming days, dont know how much il end up using, maybe 600?


[09-Feb-25 03:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	You can see how much population is available to you until the next POP report in the build screen. Its the number between the brackets. Should be 320 PIO this report period.


[09-Feb-25 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	(= 10% of current unemployment)


[09-Feb-25 04:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-25 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SanityCat**:	oof


[08-Mar-25 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	813 is still not bad for not running any immigration


[08-Mar-25 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	that, and that means (barring any new jobs being added right now) all open jobs are filled


[09-Mar-25 04:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SanityCat**:	I'm confused... the report says 535 open jobs?


[09-Mar-25 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	someones base is missing 535 people then


[09-Mar-25 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	so POPR is kinda confusing. Open Jobs is the only thing on the report that is reported before POPR happens


[09-Mar-25 04:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	So that number is the number of open jobs before migration/education takes place


[09-Mar-25 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	So in this case, we had 535 open jobs before the report, but grew 813 PIO when POPR happened. Meaning we actually have 278 spare PIO this week


[09-Mar-25 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	wth


[09-Mar-25 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	ok so those 535 were on my base then


[09-Mar-25 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Appletree23**:	I was missing a huge amount until this POPR


[09-Mar-25 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BooKliko**:	Glad you are filled up! The plan was to have that sorted last report but did not manage to get the happieness up high enoug.


[09-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SanityCat**:	that... is just a bizarre way for the report to work, but ok.


[09-Mar-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SanityCat**:	I assume unemployment is also computed before migration then


[09-Mar-25 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SanityCat**:	I'm still expecting to bring in another few hundred jobs over the next week or two.


[09-Mar-25 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
