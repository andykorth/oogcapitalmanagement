@tanda hold on, you're selling MG at low prices on the LM? that could get picked up by outside parties, no?


[01-Jun-24 03:57 PM] jvaler#0000
or do you produce excess for our current PG needs?


[01-Jun-24 04:01 PM] tanda#0000
I produce a lot excess. Initial plan was for like one more base than wound up being done?


[01-Jun-24 04:01 PM] tanda#0000
I've actually been having to export some MG to ANT to keep my storage under control


[01-Jun-24 04:04 PM] evany.#0000
well i can stock a bit mroe so i picked some up from you!


[01-Jun-24 04:21 PM] tanda#0000
thank you for your business


[02-Jun-24 02:37 PM] jvaler#0000
@histidinedwarf i contribute MGS D:

my bad, I'll add


[03-Jun-24 06:58 AM] acramernc#0000
does anyone have like 30 carbon i can buy off of them at elon? was travelling this weekend and let it run out, my resupply ship won't get there for 5.5 hrs


[03-Jun-24 07:00 AM] tanda#0000
I have some, send a cont

[04-Jun-24 03:17 PM] tanda#0000
I produce 400 MG a day, and currently have 4k on hand


[04-Jun-24 06:58 PM] evany.#0000
i have about 15 days right now after i bought the last batch off you


[04-Jun-24 07:00 PM] evany.#0000
our demands will increase soon - about halfway to last expert


[04-Jun-24 08:46 PM] tanda#0000
I believe the original build budgeted for 4 bases at 100/units per day


[04-Jun-24 08:46 PM] tanda#0000
so I'll just maintain that for now


[04-Jun-24 10:35 PM] jvaler#0000
corp hq shouldn't mess that up cause all the bases get the bonus lol


[04-Jun-24 11:10 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We might need another person seeing how the PG price isn't exactly zooming after it reached 40$


[04-Jun-24 11:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Though I think we should wait and see if the price of C drops soon, after every soul in Antares started planning a C base


[04-Jun-24 11:12 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Don't wanna make it worse


[05-Jun-24 12:14 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe PPP needs an in-project C supply?


[05-Jun-24 12:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I mean, that would just starve the CX even more


[05-Jun-24 12:27 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And if we make enough new bases to supply ourselves, we have enough bases to bring C to atleast 700$-650$ consistently


[05-Jun-24 12:41 PM] tanda#0000
Primary bottle neck at this point is FRMs


[05-Jun-24 12:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I have 1000 GRN I can part with on Harmonia


[05-Jun-24 12:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I made too much


[05-Jun-24 12:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And it's hard to transport


[05-Jun-24 12:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If anybody isn't self sufficient with their own FRMs


[05-Jun-24 03:26 PM] jvaler#0000
that'd relieve pressure off the CX, cause it's still extra production


[05-Jun-24 03:26 PM] jvaler#0000
moving the demand off-market means others will be buying what we otherwise would be using up


[05-Jun-24 10:56 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If we do have extra production, enough to supply ourselves, we can post it on CX to bring the price down while supplying ourselves


[05-Jun-24 10:56 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Is the way I see it


[05-Jun-24 10:57 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I actually don't know what I would consider a fair price for C


[05-Jun-24 10:57 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
What it was before was rather low


[05-Jun-24 10:57 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So maybe ~680$


[06-Jun-24 05:10 AM] jvaler#0000
i think 650/u is good


[06-Jun-24 06:42 AM] evany.#0000
it's half the reason i spun up C production , half cause of cx prices half cause of elon
i will inevitably have extra to sell once i'm operational post-popr


[06-Jun-24 06:43 AM] evany.#0000
I don't know that I can provide for all our bases, but i'm happy to. I always intended to post in #trading once i'm operational to offer Cervisves!


[06-Jun-24 07:41 AM] jvaler#0000
we await your Cervisves in anticipation


[09-Jun-24 01:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The stocks are looking pretty good and we might start considering our next plan of action

[09-Jun-24 01:02 PM] tanda#0000
Did you have something that comes to mind to target?


[09-Jun-24 01:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think if it stays around 37.5 by the end of the week we pretty much won


[09-Jun-24 01:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
C comes to mind


[09-Jun-24 01:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But I am still wary of overshooting it since I am suspecting everybody and their pioneers are making a base


[09-Jun-24 01:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I was thinking of trying out smaller targets that we can knock out with one dedicated base


[09-Jun-24 01:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Something that isn't supplied on the CX well but  could be used for producing something profitable


[09-Jun-24 01:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
TCS comes to mind, but it's really just for HSE


[09-Jun-24 01:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But it would make use of our HQ and cheaper HSE would help colonize other planets


[09-Jun-24 01:06 PM] tanda#0000
not exactly small in scope, but how about TCL>KV>RDE/ADE ?


[09-Jun-24 01:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
hm


[09-Jun-24 01:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I like the idea of building a consistent Afab market


[09-Jun-24 01:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And pulling it out of in-corp trading


[09-Jun-24 01:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think we should pick an overarching goal of some sort, something that when we achieve it would be a clear indication of progress


[09-Jun-24 01:08 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And all fabs being available in enough supply is fitting


[09-Jun-24 01:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We could also try making all the governing goods accesible on CX and not have the supply being a requirement prior to becoming a governor


[09-Jun-24 01:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Both of those would need to be made more specific first


[09-Jun-24 01:09 PM] tanda#0000
that's honestly pretty simple, isn't it? the only price effective one is OFF


[09-Jun-24 01:10 PM] tanda#0000
tbh, my own goals right now are to try to drop prices on some of the things like INS/SEA/HSE


[09-Jun-24 01:10 PM] tanda#0000
those are all rather too large for me to do on my own, so right now I'm just targeting INS with my next expansion


[09-Jun-24 01:11 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
mhm


[09-Jun-24 01:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
In the far far future when we feel like we have a very healthy CX, expanding into newer planets with cheaper red planet materials would be awesome, but too far for me to be thinking about rn


[09-Jun-24 01:16 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@CULT What do y'all think our overarching goals should be, and in what order ? So far we thought of:
1. Making all fabs easily available on CX with no need for in-corp trading to achieve end game projects
2. Making all governing mats available on CX so governors can do their thing without first dedicating bases to making the stuff
3. Cheaper red planet mats
(All of these need to be made more specific so we know when we actually achieved them)

[09-Jun-24 01:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I personally think that making the governing mats should be the first thing we focus on, then fabs, then red planet mats


[09-Jun-24 01:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also feel free to suggest more things to do


[09-Jun-24 01:19 PM] tanda#0000
if you're interested in working on governing mats, which ones are you interested in targeting? OFF is the main one, but then what else is needed?


[09-Jun-24 01:19 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I do not know enough about them because I never governed :(


[09-Jun-24 01:19 PM] tanda#0000
and wouldn't having cheaper red planet mats make producing afabs easier with more locations to use? not to mention it puts in a lot of the structure you would need to produce AFABS


[09-Jun-24 01:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@jvaler You're a governor, right ? Any opinion on governing mat market ?


[09-Jun-24 01:21 PM] jvaler#0000
unfortunately i don't keep up with that as all i use is OFF lol

[09-Jun-24 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
i think an INS project would be pretty cool though. antares has lots of INS planets


[09-Jun-24 01:22 PM] tanda#0000
@cptcoleslaw was looking into having some of these supply materials made


[09-Jun-24 01:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe INS would help for a couple planets. Also I've never seen Tiezndor and holy LST

[09-Jun-24 01:31 PM] tanda#0000
It's not insanely bad?


[09-Jun-24 01:33 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It increases the price of the base by half mil as the CX is now


[09-Jun-24 01:33 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And it's also annoying for repairs because you always need one full TSH, I believe


[09-Jun-24 01:34 PM] tanda#0000
Cheaper INS also means cheaper exploitation of SE-110

[09-Jun-24 01:35 PM] tanda#0000
which will directly drop C, RAT, and DW prices


[09-Jun-24 01:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Sounds fair


[09-Jun-24 01:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
INS should be higher up in priority


[09-Jun-24 01:36 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
What price do you think it should be and how many bases would be required ?


[09-Jun-24 01:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And would it cause any fiasco similar to C without extra supply


[09-Jun-24 01:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We can figure it out later as well

[09-Jun-24 01:41 PM] tanda#0000
so it looks like with current market costs, 115 is a good initial target for INS, at least until some components can be made cheaper as well


[09-Jun-24 01:41 PM] tanda#0000
that still gets you a base that pays itself off in 36 days


[09-Jun-24 01:42 PM] tanda#0000
as far as supply issues, honestly yes. THF is not produced in large quantities outside of a few individual, and these bases will use a lot of PE


[09-Jun-24 01:42 PM] tanda#0000
AR I'm not sure of


[09-Jun-24 01:44 PM] tanda#0000
I think two INS bases are all that is likely to be needed to drop the price, but they both will need a few bases to make THF


[09-Jun-24 01:52 PM] tanda#0000
correction, one full base to make THF is enough to sustain 5 full bases doing INS


[09-Jun-24 01:53 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We could probably contact one of the people already making TSH, see if they could produce more at their base, and work together


[09-Jun-24 01:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I suspect they would be glad to make more if there was actually demand


[09-Jun-24 01:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I've been buying TSH for a while and it's just been getting stocked up more and more


[09-Jun-24 01:56 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, TSH is enough of a pain I don't even have the start of a plan for it


[09-Jun-24 01:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'll start messaging some of them


[09-Jun-24 01:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
How much more TSH/day do we need ?


[09-Jun-24 01:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Oh shit, I meant THF


[09-Jun-24 01:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
thermofluid for INS


[09-Jun-24 01:59 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
That's what we are talking about


[09-Jun-24 02:00 PM] tanda#0000
if we're just running two INS bases, only like 140 a day. I think sidepipe had some available + was maybe increasing production


[09-Jun-24 02:05 PM] tanda#0000
if PE is an issue, that could be covered by one base, which uses only slightly more than a full smelting base a day in C


[09-Jun-24 02:06 PM] tanda#0000
same base would also be able to manufacture other things on the side, like OFF using PG from the PPP project


[09-Jun-24 02:09 PM] tanda#0000
so to summarize (because I do ramble on): My initial impression of the INS market suggests that we should be able to adjust the price down to 115/unit with 2 full PP2 bases, most likely on Aceland, and 1 full BMP base on Hephaestus. THF is likely best sourced from people currently producing it, and I think AR can be safely ignored, but can be readily supplied by a half RIG base on KI-401d


[09-Jun-24 02:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@sidepipe Is that true ?


[09-Jun-24 02:24 PM] sidepipe#0000

[09-Jun-24 02:24 PM] sidepipe#0000

[09-Jun-24 02:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
Have 1K at ANT right now, make 91.6 per day, could easily expand


[09-Jun-24 02:25 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe the role shouldn't be a requirement :(


[09-Jun-24 02:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
nah, it's all good


[09-Jun-24 02:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
I was planning on slowing down DDT production anyway since I'm currently getting undercut a lot in ANT, so I'll have lots of spare LAB capacity


[09-Jun-24 02:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well we'll probably be asking stuff of others like coleslaw


[09-Jun-24 02:27 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
There's enough stock of THF at ANT that we can get more going if we start running out


[09-Jun-24 02:27 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So sounds like THF is ok


[09-Jun-24 02:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
yep, I can easily expand to 140/day if you want to go this route, just have to change recipes. Lmk if you're interested in buying once or regularly and we can discuss what a fair set price is üôÇ


[09-Jun-24 03:29 PM] jvaler#0000
current INS price is actually worse than 0.5mil for a 1 permit base :P


[09-Jun-24 03:35 PM] flor2081#0000
it's pretty easy to make yourself though, that should cut the cost by a lot


[09-Jun-24 03:35 PM] flor2081#0000
oh, i should read further than just the last msg lol


[09-Jun-24 04:36 PM] evany.#0000
I probably have to think about repairs before I drop another base, but I have plenty of permits so I‚Äôm down for whatever makes the number go up.


[09-Jun-24 04:37 PM] evany.#0000
Do we have the pe and other materials necessary or would we need to spin those up too


[09-Jun-24 04:44 PM] tanda#0000
we'd need less than one base to run two INS producers


[09-Jun-24 04:44 PM] tanda#0000
and yes, I am looking at having to repair and resupply in two weeks, so I can't do anything in the immediate future


[10-Jun-24 06:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

a shipful? god damn


[06-Jul-24 01:55 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We should currently be making about 20k PG/dau


[06-Jul-24 01:55 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
@tanda Would you have enough MG for another base ?


[06-Jul-24 01:56 PM] tanda#0000
the main issue with that is actually MGS. jvaler supplies me with what few cycles can be spared from their mining base there


[06-Jul-24 01:56 PM] tanda#0000
I have that base packed out with CHPs right now, but I'm not against moving them to another planet (like Bober)


[06-Jul-24 02:00 PM] razesdark#0000
I have half of a permit remaining on a planet that has MGS, but as it is, it will only extract about 23MGS/d


[06-Jul-24 02:17 PM] tanda#0000
how much MG is each base using with 5 experts?


[06-Jul-24 02:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
106/day


[06-Jul-24 02:17 PM] tanda#0000
I currently make 485  units per day


[06-Jul-24 02:18 PM] tanda#0000
once I repair, it should be back up to 510ish


[06-Jul-24 02:19 PM] tanda#0000
I only use a single expert, so I can either increase the number of experts or add an additional BMP to satisfy all 5 bases


[06-Jul-24 02:20 PM] tanda#0000
3 experts 9 BMPs translates to 556 MG per day


[07-Jul-24 11:33 AM] jvaler#0000
now that rise is in the server y'all can negotiate with them to cut into my CLI prod in favor of MGS

@tanda If you add another BMP, Jvaler won't have enough MGS ? If so, can you buy some extra from CX ?


[07-Jul-24 12:45 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, that shouldn't be an issue

Below 320? I‚Äôm fine with sticking at 320


[15-Jul-24 04:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd sell you all 755 at 300/u (or any amount less than that if you don't need it all) - call it a bulk discount to clear out some of my ancient CXOS üòÑ


[15-Jul-24 04:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
Though I realize that doesn't make a huge difference in total price. But I'm not losing money either way

@realmraker it's a bit of a jog from west antares (insitor) to ANT


[06-Aug-24 09:05 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Will you leave one ship at home and then take another one here for Elon ?


[06-Aug-24 09:10 AM] realmraker#0000
Yea I could do that


[06-Aug-24 09:11 AM] realmraker#0000
But is it possible to just buy warehouse on the planet and just use lms for shipping


[06-Aug-24 09:11 AM] evany.#0000
Technically yes


[06-Aug-24 09:11 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
It would be a pain in the ass to LM all the supplies


[06-Aug-24 09:11 AM] evany.#0000
But dangerous to rely on that


[06-Aug-24 09:12 AM] realmraker#0000
All the pg is being sold on the cx ?


[06-Aug-24 09:12 AM] realmraker#0000
And do you guys have dedicated shippers ?


[06-Aug-24 09:12 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
1. yes
2. no


[06-Aug-24 09:13 AM] realmraker#0000
I would have to ship my own produced goods then


[06-Aug-24 09:14 AM] evany.#0000
Yes and while you could request it it can take days


[06-Aug-24 09:15 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
The import weight of the base isn't too bad since we source the MG with LM and the export weight is literally like 10t


[06-Aug-24 09:15 AM] evany.#0000
I think the grants are in general based for those living in antares or planning to move to antares


[06-Aug-24 09:15 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
So you'd be able to fit another base in ANT with the same ship


[06-Aug-24 09:15 AM] realmraker#0000
OK cool

[06-Aug-24 09:20 AM] histidinedwarf#0000

Im planning on dropping a mostly pg base on Elon tomorrow-ish, is there room/MG available  w/ PPP atm? Wouldnt need any for a bit

I generally have a stockpile of around 5k on Elon at any given point


[16-Dec-24 07:08 AM] tanda#0000
It's not really about room. The majority of these projects are about coordinating like minded people to help overproduce certain markets.


[16-Dec-24 07:09 AM] tanda#0000
Since ADI doesn't have much taste for C production, we don't even have an in house source of C. But I believe Finest_One is working on providing H imports to Elon.


[16-Dec-24 07:10 AM] tanda#0000
And there is the CULT tag itself. We do have a corporate HQ on Elon


[16-Dec-24 08:05 AM] finestone#0000
Yes I can import H or you can pick up yourself on KI401d


[16-Dec-24 08:06 AM] finestone#0000
Also i wouldn't say we are anywhere close to overproducing


[16-Dec-24 08:34 AM] tanda#0000
Oh I know. PPP seems to have gone back to an early stage. Both of the CULT activities seems to be missing their marks currently


[16-Dec-24 09:05 AM] finestone#0000
I think there has also just been Inflation in game so the #s were lagging


[16-Dec-24 09:05 AM] finestone#0000
I think CULT provides valuable commodities to ANT market and we will continue to do so :strong:


[16-Dec-24 09:18 AM] realharvey#0000
Well there is a lot of stuff going on when you try to produce a lot of sth. to drive the Price drown.

- You increase the demand on the input materials and therefore increase the price of them.
- When you also drive down the Endproduct price this will lead to lower margins.
- With lower margins on a product people are less likely to produce them and are looking for more profitable endeavors.
- When there is a lot of cheap supply it leads to more Industries using the product aswell.

So ultimately for a Product like PG it's very hard to get a desired price. INS has a better chance at a stable market, because its an Endproduct and people can't infinitly scale building bases needing INS

Honestly, you should consider giving a bonus on AGP grant to bases that could fit in a cult operation


[24-Dec-24 07:33 AM] realharvey#0000
part of AGP is that people learn how to approach the market and find their own ways. Aim is that they develop their own skills. If we give them easy soloutions they will just take them and not learn as much.


[24-Dec-24 07:33 AM] tanda#0000
I'm sure we could get some interest free loans lined up for new participants

i wish i could afford to subsidize some PG bases


[24-Dec-24 07:59 AM] jcheung#0000
i could if i could just stop taking on new loans


[24-Dec-24 08:05 AM] realharvey#0000
never stop :D


[24-Dec-24 08:05 AM] realharvey#0000
until you hit the A-Fab permit paywall

kinda same boat was looking at my PG production i used to sell all of it on CX and now maybe 20% is making it to CX


[24-Dec-24 02:01 PM] .shiva.#0000
I picked the right time to start one i guess


[17-Feb-25 02:48 PM] chalu2#0000
hi, would someone be interested in giving a loan for a EPO producing base on Electronica?

oh wait this is #ppp-operations not #agp-operations lmao


[17-Feb-25 03:01 PM] jvaler#0000
@chalu2 were you applying for the AGP grant or an actual loan?


[17-Feb-25 03:01 PM] chalu2#0000
already got a agp, so a loan this time


[17-Feb-25 03:02 PM] jvaler#0000
oh shoot yea you're on the sheet


[17-Feb-25 03:03 PM] jvaler#0000
my bad


[17-Feb-25 03:03 PM] realharvey#0000
so do we just increase grants to 2 mil?


[17-Feb-25 03:03 PM] jvaler#0000
i can still do a loan though, how much do you need and what payment deadline do you want? my rate is 3% per week


[17-Feb-25 03:04 PM] jvaler#0000
no i send a term request lel


[17-Feb-25 03:05 PM] tanda#0000
What's your initial start for this base look like? The materials for the base cost as much as the production buildings for a 10 day supply


[17-Feb-25 03:05 PM] tanda#0000
Are you considering starting out with a half base of POLs?


[17-Feb-25 03:09 PM] chalu2#0000
it would be my third base. I need to spent 20.000,00 more to finish the HQ upgrade first, and than I thought about building up that plan in one go. I produce RAT and DW myself, other consumables need to be bought.


[17-Feb-25 03:10 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, mostly I'm concerned about the cost of CL to keep that running for you


[17-Feb-25 03:10 PM] tanda#0000
POPI consumables are cheap for a base like that

[17-Feb-25 03:11 PM] chalu2#0000
I think with 4 weeks I would be on the safe side to ramp up production. 3 weeks should probably be enought, but better safe then sorry...


[17-Feb-25 03:13 PM] chalu2#0000
a right, haven't considered that


[17-Feb-25 03:14 PM] tanda#0000
You would be fine to do it on the same budget with half a permit initially, and funnel money from it into building it up further


[17-Feb-25 03:22 PM] chalu2#0000
yeah sounds good. I that case five weeks is probably better


[17-Feb-25 03:37 PM] chalu2#0000
Would you do a 3 mil loan over 4 weeks? or 2 mil over 5 weeks?


[17-Feb-25 03:44 PM] jvaler#0000
something like this?

[17-Feb-25 03:58 PM] chalu2#0000
how long would it be to the first repayment? getting the first payment in time would be very tight, but in 5 weeks i'm confident i could do it.
@jvaler


[17-Feb-25 04:02 PM] jvaler#0000
i can do that


[17-Feb-25 04:02 PM] chalu2#0000

[30-Apr-25 09:54 PM] tanda#0000
definitely a huge consideration for anyone looking for an idea for their next base (also not too large of import export)


[30-Apr-25 09:56 PM] tanda#0000
I want to point out that as of a couple days ago, I have stopped MG production and am moving to utilize different buildings on my manufacturing planets.


[30-Apr-25 09:56 PM] tanda#0000
That leaves the MG market in ANT pretty thin, if anyone wants to try to make money in that niche as well


[30-Apr-25 10:00 PM] tanda#0000
That market is a little less shipping friendly. Ideally you should work with a partner and vertically integrate, or run dual COGC on a major source of MGS


[30-Apr-25 11:28 PM] finestone#0000
Yeah i just planned out another PG base


[01-May-25 12:54 AM] laaxus#0000
Yep I'm planning to replace 3 chp bases with pol


[01-May-25 01:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
im about to build another pol base rn aswell


[01-May-25 01:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
I think 5 new pol bases is well enough


[01-May-25 01:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
1 base makes like 5k a day


[01-May-25 01:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
so between just us three thats 25k more pg a day


[01-May-25 01:50 AM] realharvey#0000
5 bases will definitely turn PG into not profitable anymore. Just like CL got out of hand with so many bases

{Reactions}
dread 

[01-May-25 01:51 AM] laaxus#0000
Then maybe I'll wait a bit


[01-May-25 01:51 AM] laaxus#0000
The entire market is reconfiguring


[01-May-25 02:07 AM] realharvey#0000
Or do one base at a time


[01-May-25 08:28 AM] tanda#0000
definitely do one base


[01-May-25 08:29 AM] laaxus#0000
CL is still good


[01-May-25 08:29 AM] laaxus#0000
Just not Monster OP anymore


[01-May-25 08:45 AM] sidepipe#0000
I wonder if we‚Äôll see the average profitability of most bases decrease now that the infinite money hose has been turned down a bit - since it‚Äôll now take more workers / goods for every unit of money entering the MM


[01-May-25 08:45 AM] laaxus#0000
exactly my thought


[01-May-25 08:46 AM] tanda#0000
I hope so! expecting to have every base make more than 130k is a bit weird, coming from an older version of the game where 80k/day was good profit


[01-May-25 08:47 AM] laaxus#0000
Before, you could get absurd profit/d with IDC so other bases had to have a much higher profit / d to be competitive


[01-May-25 08:47 AM] laaxus#0000
I think 80k will be the new normal


[01-May-25 08:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm gonna guess 60k/day based on nothing at all and purely to be contrarian


[01-May-25 08:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I guess it‚Äôll really all depend on how many people use the new MMs and how profitable they are


[01-May-25 08:49 AM] laaxus#0000
80k new normal for the ceil
50k-80k will hold 95% of the bases and 60k will be the mode


[01-May-25 08:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
Ah, okay. Then I‚Äôm not even being contrarian üòÑ


[01-May-25 08:50 AM] laaxus#0000
many bases are at 50k atm


[01-May-25 08:50 AM] laaxus#0000
but anyway


[01-May-25 08:50 AM] laaxus#0000
gonna be interesting months


[01-May-25 11:31 AM] bishopsix#0000
I haven't moved above 100k since i started and i am loving it
