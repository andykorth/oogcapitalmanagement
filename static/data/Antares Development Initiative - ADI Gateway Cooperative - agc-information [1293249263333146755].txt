## Ledger Update

I have updated the ledger with the 3rd gateway, from Hekaton -> BEN. The ledger now shows progress towards each individual gateway, with pledged allocated from the first gateway to the last gateway.

Our current pledged resources account for the following:


* 97.8%    Heph -> Hekaton
* 80.0%    Hekaton -> Heph
* 9.9%    Hekaton -> BEN

With the addition of the third gateway, more room for pledges has opened up!

## Cash Contributions:

With 130m donated, I have begun spending the cash contributions to fill out materials. Only 15.6m has been spent so far, because I've been aggressively responsible with contributed cash. My fiduciary duty means I must buy at good prices to ensure donators get a good quantity of shares for their donations.  I do have open buy orders pending on various CXes.
