**ChineseEarthquake**:	hey all, I'm migrating away from titanium and no longer need this planet. I'm deconstructing my base but I don't have enough room on my ship so I posted an ad to sell some RAT under market value if anyone wants it.


[12-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MoonSugarTravels**:	Hi! Gotta say reading through the chat worried me a bit lol - is this planet basically a semi-anarchy since ChineseEarthquake left? :D


[20-Mar-24 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	haha not really anarchy.  Just alot of friendly donations :)


[20-Mar-24 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrSmith33**:	I have CoGC mats if needed, and POPR seems good for some time


[20-Mar-24 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	well, the TEC's are hurting a tid-little bit but hopefully not fer long


[20-Mar-24 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrSmith33**:	ah, didn't see them


[20-Mar-24 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrSmith33**:	Though, doesn't feel like the right planet for TECs


[20-Mar-24 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	agree.  it's a temp spot for TNP's until better location is fit into somewhere ... for my situation at least


[20-Mar-24 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Friendly donations? What are the taxes for, then?


[20-Mar-24 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	we got a governor now.  didnt before.  so the 'friendly donations' should become a thing of the past.


[20-Mar-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	we havent heard a word from him yet though or seen any contributions yet.  so "shrugs, i dunno"


[20-Mar-24 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Yeah exactly. A governor with taxes set alright but no contribs to anything, and "friendly donations" keeping the CoGC running lol


[20-Mar-24 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Hey @Kayron_Jarvis, what's up? :D


[22-Mar-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kayron_Jarvis**:	@MoonSugarTravels Not a lot just seen how the governor system works in this game. It seems the only new thing I can do is to change the fees for everything From 0 to 9999.


[22-Mar-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	you can also set governor programs if wanted (might be a good way to get techs on the planet for those that want them), as well as set the level infrastructure buildings run at if for some reason you want to run at less than max (eg, getting rid of excess population)


[22-Mar-24 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	can also adjust LM and warehouse fees


[22-Mar-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kayron_Jarvis**:	That's true but the options you mentioned Won't have as much of an impact On the players as raising the taxes to the maximum. All of them are set at 20 at this point and I'm planning to keep them there at least until Monday


[22-Mar-24 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	...and make sure the CoGC is stocked at all times. I must admit I cringed a little bit when I read that 9. march message "CoGC next week, who's next?" xD


[22-Mar-24 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	raising taxes to maximum eh?  For a PLI of <10k.  You'll be a one-term gov


[22-Mar-24 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kayron_Jarvis**:	There's no point of being a penny in the ass As I am mining And refining on the planet as well the bed to off everybody is the better a file will be as well


[22-Mar-24 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	@molp please hurry with that governments update... xdd


[22-Mar-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harpercz**:	anyway, we need happines atleast on 50%+, to keep population stable, and i recomended running program for Technicians :)


[22-Mar-24 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	I thought it was more a question of what can a governor do, so I pointed out what else they can do


[22-Mar-24 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	but yeah, a governor can shut a planet down for a month by maxing out taxes, but previously, when this happened, the planet just shut down for a month, this was before steam release, everyone just shuts down all production lines since the taxes are more than profit from the item


[22-Mar-24 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	post steam release, less likely, the profits for a lot of items are better now (more consumers, more people moving up the tech tree, preventing flooding of low tier items)


[22-Mar-24 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's also why there is such a preference to re-elect existing governors, unless the previous governor stuffs up big time or a lot, they will almost always be re-elected. I speak as one of the few people that managed to replace an existing governor that didn't stuff up (I built a shipyard in system on SE-648A


[22-Mar-24 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I am seriously thinking about running for Gov here to oust this guy with his absurd plans and uncontributive behavior.


[22-Mar-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bazdakka**:	it's why I ran on SE-648a


[22-Mar-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	Will see exactly just how he operates over this term.

**Kayron_Jarvis**:	Well I've added some more stuff to the upkeep, most of it stuff I can manufacture so it should be easy to keep it coming. So what does people think about it?


[03-Apr-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Do you calculate how much stuff to add to POPI, or just guesstimate?


[03-Apr-24 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I think the latter. According to my quick look, you could save on upkeep by reducing SST to level 1, running INF on 2 out of 3 mats, and PAR on 2 out of 5. This would still yield 100% need fulfillment across the board (it's a separate question whether we *need* that much).

[24-Aug-24 03:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	We're a little short of PIO, with no growth in the last pop report. Do we need to do something to fill the gap (136 PIO, and 50 TECH open jobs)


[24-Aug-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Hmmm gee wonder what could be done... maybe provide some upkeep stuff to the POPI? 🤔


[24-Aug-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	tbh, most cost effective method is probably a SET immigration programme rather than popi upkeep goods given the gap is >200 pop.


[24-Aug-24 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Idk why SET immigration, did you mean Planetary Festivities? In either case, I would suggest a longer-term strategy, i.e. we don't just want to cover the current open jobs but also build up a bit of an unemployment buffer so we could welcome new players.


[24-Aug-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Ah, I meant PIO


[24-Aug-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Besides we've got taxes at 20, we should be able to afford anything. But I won't do the maths on it, I'm not in the government.


[24-Aug-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Oh looky here, election starts in 15.5h ;p


[24-Aug-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	The only reason I suggested a program over upkeep goods was the happiness is in the stable range. There's a fair case for creating a buffer in case there are other new bases.


[24-Aug-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	In which case upkeep goods would be better.


[24-Aug-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	"In case there are new bases" -- people should be hesitant about starting a base on a planet without sufficient population, I know I am. So I'd say we won't see many newcomers until we sort our pop out.


[24-Aug-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	That's fair


[24-Aug-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I'm a bit logistically constrained right now, otherwise I'd ship some OFF here.


[24-Aug-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	but... I need the TIO


[24-Aug-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	I have OFF onsite; happy to sell to the Gov here.  But I really dont think that this Kayron_Jarvis NPC, thats our Gov :roll_eyes:, even reads chats or monitors POPI.  My history on this PLI, since he somehow got voted in as Gov awhile ago, has taught me this.   So most probably wont be fixed until he's voted out.


[24-Aug-24 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	election starts in 8 hours.


[25-Aug-24 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Ok, good to know. :)


[25-Aug-24 02:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	It's a shame as the plantary needs aren't all that complicated when the vast majority of the pop required is PIO.


[25-Aug-24 02:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	I've got an Excel sheet for managing planets which I use for AJ-768a Lemuria and KC-765c. Vote me in and I'll make a copy for this lil old rock :p

[28-Aug-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I've supplies to refill the CoGC arriving in 18 hours, and 750 OFF to mostly fill up the SST. Needed to do a transport run to take stuff back to ANT anyway.


[28-Aug-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Hopefully the current governor will fill them, but if not, can sort it


[28-Aug-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	As a backup


[29-Aug-24 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I've restocked the CoGC and put 75 days of OFF in the SST. I hope the latter will improve the growth of PIO for the next POPR

**MrSmith33**:	Thanks

[02-Sep-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	The short term plan is to stop the bleeding: we'll be changing settings and providing upkeep to stabilize the technician population and build up some pioneer buffer. Also, CoGC upkeep stuff is on the way, will be provided in time.


[02-Sep-24 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	If someone wants to employ more technicians, we'd appreciate letting us know so we can plan for it.


[20-Sep-24 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoonSugarTravels**:	Whoever is a technician short - sorry. We're going to make adjustments if necessary, and for now we've called in a shipment of fresh techs for the next week.

I think we've done a fairly decent job at stabilizing this planet in this term, and I'm sure @Akyan will take good care of it in the long run :) Thanks for the good times, good luck to all of ya and maybe see you in the future!

[28-Oct-24 11:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	It's leftovers from when this PLI was starting to grow.  Now just is taking up space


[29-Oct-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	I'd ship it. Only really using DW/OFF for upkeep now


[29-Oct-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Thanks for the offer though.


[30-Oct-24 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	👍


[02-Nov-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Hi folks, I've crunched the numbers and it'll be quite a bit more efficient to run just the SST and just upgraded INF on OFF than keeping the WCE & PAR fed with DW, so making a few changes on upkeep. The net satisfaction for PIO/SET/TEC should moderately improve, with TEC stabilising fairly soon.


[02-Nov-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	If anyone has a need for growth in anything other than PIO, please do let me know so I can adjust accordingly.


[28-Nov-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**62**:	Good evening Akyan, I would be interested in a growth of technicians. This population is not growing quickly.

[03-Jan-25 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	i don't actually know if bojidar has SCB ships cause i don't make ads for that size


[03-Jan-25 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	20k seems pricey for only 500t


[03-Jan-25 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	Yeah not sure what prices people like.. pick them up but i guess its free money to those who are already going that way.


[03-Jan-25 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	Also 2nd question how to hell do I actually get a large ship cargo hold?


[03-Jan-25 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	if you want a WCB you should upgrade your starter ships into them, it's most cost effective that way


[03-Jan-25 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	but if you want an LCB it's best to just make a new ship with an LCB


[03-Jan-25 08:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	whats the difference


[03-Jan-25 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	The goods i am and transporting are the same weight/vol if that helps


[03-Jan-25 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	a WCB has 3000t/1000m^3 capacity, an LCB has a 2000t/2000m^3 capacity


[03-Jan-25 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	on a new ship construction a WCB ship tends to be ~1/3 cheaper than an LCB ship


[03-Jan-25 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	ah so I want a LCB


[03-Jan-25 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	this is due to volume determining the size of the crew quarters and how many emitters are required


[03-Jan-25 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	if you're exporting O, then yes


[03-Jan-25 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	indeed


[03-Jan-25 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	how much is one gonna set me back?


[03-Jan-25 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	if you want it ASAP, ~6mil, if you want it in a month or two, ~4mil


[03-Jan-25 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	however, if you're strapped for cash i can point you towards a starter -> WCB upgrade ASAP for just 1.35mil


[03-Jan-25 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	the starter -> WCB upgrade deal also has financing available to give you a 0% interest 90 day loan for the 1.35mil


[03-Jan-25 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	its fine, I am happy to save up and use shippinh contracts for a bit.


[03-Jan-25 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	alright, whatever works for you


[03-Jan-25 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	I am avoiding taking loans kinda like the grind in earning shiz myself.


[03-Jan-25 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	fair enough


[03-Jan-25 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	the upgrade offer is still open without financing too, just so you know


[03-Jan-25 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	if you're ever interested again i can send you an invite to the Antares Development Initiative server where the upgrade kits are sold


[03-Jan-25 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	discord server*


[03-Jan-25 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	yeah once I have that kinda cash ill poke ya.


[03-Jan-25 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	sounds good!


[04-Jan-25 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrSmith33**:	Rebs, your cargo is at ANT. You need more storage space for me to fulfill


[04-Jan-25 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	try now just renting some more space.


[04-Jan-25 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	FYI.- I've shipped the fabs to finish off the WH upgrade.


[04-Jan-25 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	@Rebs how did you end up having your only(first?) base being on SE-648c?


[04-Jan-25 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	I started on phobos and was having a hard time, was making LI but then someone robbed the market of all the LIO so had to change it up and I did some research and thought Oxygen is needed for all the metal shiz and its rather cheap to setup. so I moved here.


[04-Jan-25 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	This was just before the Oxygen all got brought out too so kinda got lucky with timings.


[04-Jan-25 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	Phobos i was making like 20k a day on LI, I am in a much better position now.


[04-Jan-25 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	oh that's awesome


[04-Jan-25 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jvaler**:	yeah SE-648c is great, just logistically intensive


[04-Jan-25 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	yeah going to have to rely on shipping contracts for a fair while.

**Rebs**:	Anyone heading to AI1, I have a 1k ton shipping contract for 15k if anyone is interested.


[07-Jan-25 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	LMA SE-648c/167


[08-Jan-25 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	Can anyone help explain how I can get my workforce up? I have capacity for 800 require 750 but only have 565.


[08-Jan-25 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	They all have their needs + lux needs met.


[08-Jan-25 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	POPR SE-648c is also saying we have unemployed workers and no open jobs which is confusing me even more.


[08-Jan-25 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	ah I see everyone gets 75% but then anything more then that gets randomly distributed


[08-Jan-25 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	How long ago did you build the production?


[08-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	You sometimes have to wait until the next pop report on Friday to get the full pop you demand.


[08-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	like maybe 30-40 hours


[08-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	Yeah I just read that!


[08-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Yeah, you'll get the rest in a couple of days


[08-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	yeah sweet just wanted to make sure i wasn't doing anything wrong gov.


[08-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	All good


[11-Jan-25 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	LMA SE-648c/173 If anyone is has space on their next trip to market.


[13-Jan-25 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	LMA SE-648c/174


[16-Jan-25 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Akyan**:	Hi folks, a quick gov update. We've a fairly healthy buffer in the gov accounts, with a net positive income after expenses each week. As such, I'm going to experiment with reducing the taxes a little to avoid an unnecessarily large balance in the government accounts.


[16-Jan-25 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	I can't believe it. A government that actually lowers taxes.


[16-Jan-25 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	If anyone wants to help a fella out I am getting rather full on Oxygen. I have some shipping contracts up. I am in the middle of upgrading my ship with WCB so that should help me out once its up.

[21-Jan-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	Yeah no one is taking shipping contracts either, but I should be getting my 2nd WCB ship soon that should theoretically be enough

**Rebs**:	Bruh by ship materials for repair, clicks repair "must be at base or shipyard" goes to base - repair button greyed out - goes to shipyard repair button greyed. yes i have the materials in the ship and have tried unloading it into warehouses. what am I doing wrong?


[30-Mar-25 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**muad_dib**:	Any chance your ship requirs


[30-Mar-25 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**muad_dib**:	Requires more materials for repair now youve flown it a bit more?


[30-Mar-25 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rebs**:	That was the case for one of the ships. the other was ?? I returned to base instead of the shipyard at was able to do it.
