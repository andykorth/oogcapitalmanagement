That's nothing, just wait until you realise that starting a new base on a planet automatically brings along 200 pios, and if they never get used and never get a habitat, they just exist on a planet with no food, no home, nothing.

@Deleted User seems like the club is mainly about growing yourself a following in antares space by bribing us with cash
(This is not a bad thing, and can still involve helping each other for everyones benefit)

It isn't necessarily about "growing a following", but instead bringing people together to help one another.


[10-Dec-23 06:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
As I've said previously, you can take the money and run and I won't hold it against you, this is just a place for people to work together should they so choose.

Yeah, i know i just wanted to poke fun a little bit


[10-Dec-23 06:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't do this out of ego or anything, simply to have a bit of a project going and to help people out.

[10-Dec-23 06:19 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I'm contemplating whether to establish a base in Antares (probably fuel) and start a shipping company between Antares and Promitor... or figure out something to build 🤷


[10-Dec-23 06:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Gotcha, just wanted to make sure there wasn't any misunderstanding.


[10-Dec-23 06:21 PM] bacchasnail#0000
No misunderstanding, simply me taking things to an extreme conclusion to poke fun.
No offense intended

U want to do prom to ANT?


[11-Dec-23 07:00 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Prom to Nike, I'll still do my carbon/pe/smelting and some small construction in prom but I'll be importing that into Nike (antares) for us to have cheaper prefabs in Antares


[11-Dec-23 07:23 AM] Deleted User#0000

I'm guessing you do HCP on PROM?


[11-Dec-23 07:31 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
HCP/MAI/GRN, I've got 2 incinerators. My goal would be able to at least do a weekly trip between them (bringing trade between Antares / Hortus) before I'd go over to my base. It'd let me do some arbitrage like I used to do in Eve Online x(


[11-Dec-23 07:44 AM] Deleted User#0000

I'm 21 days old, but that seems like an optimised for carbon base?


[11-Dec-23 07:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
3 carbon bases


[11-Dec-23 07:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
One base running HCP providing for 3 INC bases


[11-Dec-23 07:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
(Or shall I say another guy runs a HCP base for me, lol)


[11-Dec-23 07:46 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
Ah, I never thought about converting Prom to just do HCP xD


[11-Dec-23 07:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
If you want to do B-Fabs in ANT (Not advisable with all the fab manufatures in the area) it will help you allot, or just try sourcing a cheaper source of AL, might be cheaper in the long run?


[11-Dec-23 07:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
If I were you, L-fabs is allot more profitable, but allot more strata-kapital is required


[11-Dec-23 07:50 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
I can look into it, FE ore is reasonable in prom and I'm headed towards a smelter myself and I like being apart of the PP1 materials for a bit


[11-Dec-23 07:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
PP1 ain't the problem, but compare cx's and you'll find that:
ANT - Fabs
Mor - Electricals and Ships
HRT - Food, Consumables, liquids and gases, etc.)
(The other is mostly useless, lol)


[11-Dec-23 07:53 AM] cdgwaddell#0000
I was under the impression that Mor was the Construction people? But I did watch a video that was a year old and didn't think his "trading" the first 2 weeks was plausible given fuel costs but if done right could possibly make a reasonable income as a small base


[11-Dec-23 07:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Allot of Construction Materials, but Fabs and Parts are centrael in ANT

[12-Jan-24 11:59 AM] polarbearz7616#0000
I do not know if I qualify for the grant so I'll share what I am currently doing.
I am based in Phobos with no production buildings. I am currently trading from CX to CX using a Market data excel I had found and fixed/improved upon. This excel tells me the possible profits of trading with ask to bid and ask to ask between the markets. also the max profit based on weight/volume not accounting for supply (ran into an oversite on some heavy MATs). So I was wondering if my venture was something your group would be willing to look into.


[12-Jan-24 01:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do it manually for good reason.


[12-Jan-24 01:55 PM] Deleted User#0000

don't let it breach, keep extending it.

if you let it breach they just get to keep the contents of the package.

if they haven't responded to any attempts to contact them i'd just block them tbh. that way they can't accept your LM ads in the future and put your shipments at risk

Calacorm | REG (Regulus) - I'm new, one base on Harmonia on a 1 wk full efficiency schedule, plan to make a new one on Phobos (electronics!) with a grant.


[23-Jan-24 04:34 PM] jvaler#0000
whatcha gonna make on phobos? electronics is an odd choice for a new player


[23-Jan-24 04:36 PM] flor2081#0000
there's very (very) little demand for electronics so do take that into account when dedicating a full base to it, especially in the beginning as it might make a loss


[23-Jan-24 04:36 PM] calacorm#0000
Well I make RAT and DW on the starting base with a cash crop, this next product is better, WIth a meager grant I can get a piece of the SCN pie

if you look at the units traded column on the right you see that it's traded in very small quantities


[23-Jan-24 04:37 PM] jvaler#0000
be very careful with that. SCN has very little demand, so dedicating an entire base to making it would most likely flood the market


[23-Jan-24 04:37 PM] calacorm#0000
Its been selling at ask for awhile now and volume looks good, for a small setup to fit into

I planned for just one EDM on a week cycle, I dont think it will flood


[23-Jan-24 04:38 PM] flor2081#0000
ah yeah if you're not doing a full base then it's definitely fine


[23-Jan-24 04:38 PM] flor2081#0000
I thought you were going to make a full base for that


[23-Jan-24 04:38 PM] calacorm#0000
Im new, so little bites is fine for now


[23-Jan-24 04:39 PM] jvaler#0000
wdym week cycle?


[23-Jan-24 04:39 PM] calacorm#0000
I try to get as much production crammed into a week as I can and then sell


[23-Jan-24 04:39 PM] jvaler#0000

that's an interesting system


[23-Jan-24 04:41 PM] jvaler#0000
i just ship to CX whenever logistics demands it. like, enough export to fill a ship or the base needs more inputs than can fit in 1 ship


[23-Jan-24 04:41 PM] calacorm#0000
Balancing the farm is a matter of Timing the crops with the RAT cycle and filling the gaps with DW


[23-Jan-24 04:41 PM] calacorm#0000
And making it all fit in a week, its fun


[23-Jan-24 04:41 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah but that doesnt work in the beginning

One thing that came up in corp chat that I wanted to share here. In coordination with FICSIT, we recently settled SE-110a as a food processing planet, SE-110d as an INC planet... and SE-110b is in really good shape as a HYF planet. That all plays really well with SE-110c ( aka Ice Station ALpha )

[29-Jan-24 11:13 PM] .decks#0000
Can I still participate not being currently based in ANT space?


[29-Jan-24 11:13 PM] .decks#0000
I have an active pro license

We can help fund you towards getting a base in ANT if that's your goal.


[29-Jan-24 11:14 PM] .decks#0000
Great! Can’t wait to work with you guys


[29-Jan-24 11:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm at work at the minute, or on my way haha, so it'll be a bit before I can get you fully situated.

However feel free to have a look around and we'll talk about the grant some more when I'm free.

Makes sense, just hoping this influx of OOG doesn't equate to trouble later on. Known to be the tricky kind.

Well my goal is just to help people, not step on toes, and I'm sure helping people is in everyone's interest, so maybe there's some common ground to be found.


[30-Jan-24 09:29 AM] .decks#0000
Is there a wait list? I can’t imagine there’s people that rich in the game.

Yeah in the OOG channel there was some discussion and we weren't quite sure what the program was as of early yesterday. Someone had reached out for questions about trade and coordination, but maybe there was some confusion there. So I hopped in to see what was going on 😄

Hi there! Just started into this game a few weeks ago, and I figured I'm sticking around at this point.


[07-Feb-24 08:31 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Sweet! You already in Antares? (a member of leadership will give you roles and fill you in on stuff soon)


[07-Feb-24 08:31 PM] thyreaper#0000
Yeah, I started in Antares, on II - Deimos


[07-Feb-24 08:32 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
Nice! Whatcha making on deimos?


[07-Feb-24 08:32 PM] thyreaper#0000
Currently making fuel plus some questionable extractors for aluminum

All the starter options seemed to be terrible fits for fuel, but I was stubborn, lol


[07-Feb-24 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is more a case of fuel being a terrible fit for a starter.


[07-Feb-24 08:33 PM] thyreaper#0000
I've slowly been looking at others options but not found anything better than fuel, even though I have to buy all the inputs

[07-Feb-24 08:36 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
The speciality on their is Metalurgy. I'd have to look at some stuff but I'm certain going into that industry may end up being profitabl where you don't have to worry too much about fuel costs (I.e. you can outsell the costs / change your amount of trips as you expand your base and upgrade your ship).


[07-Feb-24 08:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
@thyreaper If you can pass me your company code I can give you roles to see the rest of the server. ^^


[07-Feb-24 08:37 PM] thyreaper#0000
Thanks, I'll take a look. So far I've not been struggling to afford things, and fuel for trips has been a small fraction of expenses, but there's probably better options!


[07-Feb-24 08:38 PM] thyreaper#0000
@Deleted User where do I find my company code?


[07-Feb-24 08:38 PM] cdgwaddell#0000

No problem, again it's just an template based off the handbooks tutorial. Play around with that calculator a bit on your own account with the earlier link so you can save it for yourself. I figured by looking at prices you could reuse the AL you smelt and make some CF for a decent profit

And I'm certain others in the other channels can also give you bigger and better ideas that me, just trying to help give you an idea of using your first base efficiently


[07-Feb-24 08:51 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
I had to update it a bit, youd have an HQ and Metallurgy selected on the tool. The changes include additional buildings to reflect the increased ALO from the Metallurgy bonus. x(


[07-Feb-24 08:52 PM] thyreaper#0000
I saw that while looking around. It's a bit overwhelming to figure out at the moment though!


[07-Feb-24 08:53 PM] cdgwaddell#0000
No worries, if you have any questions I'll try my best to help, I believe almost everyone in the server uses this tool or some variant of one. Their are some cool ones that show the production line of a product...

[11-Feb-24 11:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
GF on Deimos? That's a new one.


[11-Feb-24 11:24 AM] freshfromage#0000
gotta make GL somewhere


[11-Feb-24 11:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Usuaully that's Vulcan, definitely not Deimos.


[11-Feb-24 11:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
But, it works, since it matches COGC, but just unique to do it on Deimos.


[11-Feb-24 11:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Don't think I've ever seen anyone else do that.


[11-Feb-24 11:26 AM] freshfromage#0000
deimos was my first big base, building on vulcan would have increased building costs due to the HSEs required


[11-Feb-24 11:27 AM] freshfromage#0000
it's a cost that's not really an issue now, but definitely would have been when I was smaller


[11-Feb-24 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also 35 chp on grif?


[11-Feb-24 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Are you using multiple permits?


[11-Feb-24 11:29 AM] freshfromage#0000
yep


[11-Feb-24 11:29 AM] freshfromage#0000
3 permits on each planet


[11-Feb-24 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
You'll definitely want to reconsider that in the future.


[11-Feb-24 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh boy.


[11-Feb-24 11:30 AM] freshfromage#0000
yeah probably, but hq upgrade costs are fairly low for now


[11-Feb-24 11:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'd recommend stopping that mindset asap and going for one permit bases, even considering dropping down on your bases now to one permit.


[11-Feb-24 11:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
That'll be very painful soon.


[11-Feb-24 11:31 AM] freshfromage#0000
really?


[11-Feb-24 11:32 AM] freshfromage#0000
I'm able to produce and sell far more with 3 permit bases than I'd ever be able to with 1 permit bases


[11-Feb-24 11:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah, in my opinion.


[11-Feb-24 11:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
More than one permit a base isn't really ideal, at all.


[11-Feb-24 11:39 AM] freshfromage#0000
It's been working very well for me so far

[11-Feb-24 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hm.


[11-Feb-24 11:52 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
you get half as much area per permit that way, reduces your profit per permit by a lot and permits become the main bottleneck later in the game. But also it's a matter of playstyle too. I'm finally starting to double up permits just because the logistics of all these different planets is taxing and it's worth some opportunity cost to start simplifying things a bit. Early on though it hurts. 2 bases with 1000 area each could be 6 bases with 500 each. You could make *a lot* of money with an extra 1000 area and the same number of permits ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Again though, to each their own. The value of things like 'simple logistics' changes player to player so 3 permit bases can make sense


[11-Feb-24 11:54 AM] freshfromage#0000
logistics is actually a big part of it for me, especially since I'm getting into industries with high load imports/exports


[11-Feb-24 11:54 AM] freshfromage#0000
I'm happy with making less profit if it makes managing the logistics of the company much easier


[11-Feb-24 11:57 AM] freshfromage#0000
just happy to play casually, not too interested in minmaxxing, optimisation or spreadsheets (blasphemy, i know)

Hello together, 

i am a complete new Player in this Game. I took the Food Carrier and started on Antares 4 - Harmonia, i got my first production lines working and now i am overwhelmed what to do next since the jobs are going for more than 30 hours 😄


[11-Feb-24 04:01 PM] tanda#0000
definitely check out #server-information to get started with this community.


[11-Feb-24 04:03 PM] jokoblack#0000
yes i got already the pro licence


[11-Feb-24 04:05 PM] tanda#0000
I'm not experienced enough with provisioner as a start, but as I see there are two natural paths from where you are now: Carbon farming and Ration production


[11-Feb-24 04:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's a really good start honeslty. The beginning can be slow but there's plenty to learn and lots of planning you can do. I'd recommend filling your whole first base with FRMs before you move on to other things. It's easy to manage and good money. After that there's *lots* of options. We also offer grants if you decide that you have a plan and you're ready to move forward with it faster


[11-Feb-24 04:12 PM] jokoblack#0000
so when i understand in right (sorry no native english speaker) i only build FRMs on my first base and all other like water i buy so focussing on "the vegetables" right?


[11-Feb-24 04:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah more or less from my understanding


[11-Feb-24 04:15 PM] jokoblack#0000
Allright than i have a first target thanks^^


[11-Feb-24 04:22 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't know if making carbon is actually a good idea for a new player but you have no clue the things I am willing to do for some cheaper carbon


[11-Feb-24 04:22 PM] chobbycock#0000
That's how I started out, carbon is actually a decent start


[11-Feb-24 04:23 PM] chobbycock#0000
Always demand


[12-Feb-24 01:42 PM] jokoblack#0000
Me again^^
In other games like EVE i like the job as hauler/trader are in this game similiar career options, or is it more like producing and selling?
i investigatet the cx for some good and (i think so) potentially profitable trading goods to send between the CX
Now my direct questions are:
-Is there a direct Fleet/Ship Limit i can command?
-How saturated is the hauler/trader market?
-Are there any tipps to get early some hands on Ships?


[12-Feb-24 02:23 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
hauling and trading is definitely an option in this game. Maybe not as profitable as something like EVE, ships in this game are *expensive*, but it's definitely a playstyle that I've seen others do. Just not as often. *Most* people play the game focusing on the production aspect of it, and even the most successful traders do a bit of both. Producing fuel for their ships and some simple products that trade well on the markets.

As for limits, there is no fleet limit if you have a PRO license. If you are a free/basic license then you can still have lots of ships, but you can only ever have 2 in flight at a time.

Early on you can make money flying ships by accepting shipping contracts at local markets and just delivering other people's stuff. Once you have enough capitol you could transition into doing some CX to CX trading.


[12-Feb-24 02:24 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I've even made a bit of money just buying and selling things on the same market, no shipping at all. Find something with a decent spread and ok volume, put in a low ask, then sell it higher when the price rises.


[12-Feb-24 02:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Sometimes deals between CXs are so good that you could pay for other people to ship it and still make money. That can tie up lots of funds in trades, but it can allow you to trade beyond the capacity of your own fleet


[12-Feb-24 02:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Also if you like making spreadsheets, there are ways to make tools that help you find good trades ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[12-Feb-24 02:30 PM] jokoblack#0000
That would be the next Question if there are API`s to Read Orders from the CXs.
Sounds like i will do your Tip from Yesterday and Start Building Passive Money with FRMs
And do some small deliveries for the beginning.
And good tip to investigate Fuel Production


[12-Feb-24 02:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah you don't need a *huge* operation to provide just fuel for yourself, but fuel is a pretty high volume industry so if you get a couple bases making that it's a pretty profitable foundation for a trader playstyle. Maybe a base for SSC/LHP/FLP/MFK too for ship repairs. Those are useful for a large ship fleet and profitable to sell if you have excess.


[12-Feb-24 02:36 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
As for APIs, there is a player-made API called FIO that most people use


[12-Feb-24 02:36 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
https://discord.com/channels/667551433503014924/783066569860972545


[12-Feb-24 02:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
It's a browser extension and collects info from anyone with the extension the makes it accessible with an API that you can use to build your own tools. There's some CSV ones if you're just plugging it right into a spreadsheet, and even more json ones if you know more about coding than I do 😅


[12-Feb-24 02:38 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
There's definitely a lot of potential to make some very profitable trade finding tools, I've seen glimpses of some that are really cool, but that's also not the kind of tool people tend to share once they've made it


[12-Feb-24 02:39 PM] jokoblack#0000
Oh no thats not good 😄 sounds like i can dig me in into this and i will come back in a few weeks xD


[12-Feb-24 02:39 PM] jokoblack#0000
bye bye social life xDDD


[12-Feb-24 02:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeeeeeah this game is a trap for anyone who likes making tools as much as I do, lol


[12-Feb-24 02:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that said... I've learned *a lot* from these fun projects. More than I did from 2 years of school tbh


[12-Feb-24 02:42 PM] jokoblack#0000
I was breaking up with eve back in those days because i dived to deep into the hauler/trader carrier and lost the memorys on grass >.< and now this combined with programming... maybe i reconsider to play this game. But hey i learned many things about day-trading xD


[12-Feb-24 02:44 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
😆 well this game is definitely a bit more laid back than EVE. And trading is a versatile profession that is easy to pivot into a different playstyle if you wanted to


[12-Feb-24 02:45 PM] jokoblack#0000
Hm, I'll have a look at it for a month now ^^ it would be bad to fall into old patterns of behavior


[12-Feb-24 02:46 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
fair enough, I can't fault that. Maybe intentionally try a different playstyle then ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ the chill life of a farmer on Harmonia ain't so bad


[12-Feb-24 02:50 PM] jokoblack#0000
That's probably right, that's what I'm going to do first, and just in case, I'll have the starting capital to build up a fuel production facility. My first ship will also arrive with the upgrade materials for a second FRM and a second RIG.


[12-Feb-24 02:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
nice. Honestly I wouldn't recommend RIGs on Harmonia though. You'll make money with a FRM than you'd save with a RIG. You'll make more if you just buy everything and sell crops.


[12-Feb-24 02:53 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Have you looked into <https://www.prunplanner.org> for base planning? great for messing around with ideas in those slow early days

Hello hello everyone! I've read the board and some backlog. My CO: RAMP.
I'm on Deimos mainly producing prefabs. Planning on making a MK3 prefab plant and increasing the number of smelters and extractors. I also built a 2nd base on Antares II D and now extracting minerals there.

[19-Feb-24 05:33 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[19-Feb-24 05:35 PM] tanda#0000
I don't know but I wish I could rapidly diversify, getting to the point where I'll be selling at cost


[19-Feb-24 05:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I definitely think my next base needs to be using Al to produce something


[19-Feb-24 05:38 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Could always trade me 😅 my exchange rates are based on average price of goods across all CXs, so AL trades well


[19-Feb-24 05:38 PM] pawnzischeme#0000
Those of us in the Antares Initiative have certainly gotten good at producing AL.


[19-Feb-24 05:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[19-Feb-24 05:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If you're buying any of the stuff I trade on CX anyway it's worth it. Even if you're not you could sell the stuff I trade for more than the AL on CX ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

no idea what things you want to be doing in the first place lol


[12-Mar-24 07:17 AM] jvaler#0000
to be clear this is a player-run community centered around the antares faction area with a focus on helping new players.

the only functional project we have running right now is the Antares Grant Program where new antares-based players are given 750k AIC to kickstart their company and get through the early game slog (PRO/BASIC required to be able to recieve money ingame)


[12-Mar-24 07:32 AM] markusium#0000
Well i mostly just wantrd to join a Corp but seeying As im still on one planet and in need of some money i wantrd to see if i could receive some (i do have pro licence)

I dunno yet! I’m still only a week old, with maybe three days before I `coliq`’d into this setup. So I feel like I’ve got a rudimentary handle on playing PrUn, now I’m just looking to for something bigger to participate in.


[13-Mar-24 02:08 PM] talryk#0000
Having done a bunch of research about the game and it’s play leading in, I figured that if I could stick with it for at least a week I’d upgrade my license and look for more game friendos

Good afternoon/evening


[13-Mar-24 03:30 PM] jvaler#0000
hello @talryk @namenloss., just gave you associate role so you can see some of the going-ons.

currently this group's only running project is the antares grant program, where new antares based players are granted 750k to help them get through the early game slog. (grant, not a loan. no payback)


[13-Mar-24 03:31 PM] namenloss.#0000
aye, im trying estabilish myself in Antares and heard about this group, so jumped in


[13-Mar-24 03:32 PM] talryk#0000
Same! Currently only sitting on a rudimentary :AL: production line on Deimos; haven’t made too much past that yet


[13-Mar-24 03:32 PM] bojangles_1#0000

speaking of @Deleted User if any of these people want in i have some excess liquid capital i've built up to put towards the grants. lemme know when i can contribute


[13-Mar-24 03:36 PM] talryk#0000
I’m definitely interested in the program, I just dunno if I want to make use of it with what I have currently or if I should `coliq` for a cleaner start. Probably the former, though


[13-Mar-24 03:36 PM] namenloss.#0000

as iv reading fast on all channels, gas project - any more specific data like what is mostly needed and what is in surplus and can be bought?


[13-Mar-24 03:42 PM] jvaler#0000
like i said AGP is our only running project. GAS never really got off the ground, it's information is really wishy-washy.

oh, and i just realized the person who was trying to make GAS a thing actually recently quit the game lmfao. so there's that

[13-Mar-24 03:43 PM] jvaler#0000
@Deleted User should the GAS channels be cleaned up since cataclism left?


[13-Mar-24 03:43 PM] talryk#0000
Right now I’m sitting on one EXT and 2 SME, with a COL gathering O. Only import is C. My biggest question is if I should’ve bothered with the COL, but really anything “unclean” about my start is just a tiny misstep or two. Made a couple of super low-load trips to market, so burnt some fuel inefficiently. Beyond that I took a gamble and sold off the contents of the fuel tank of 1 ship at market, to help fund the second SME


[13-Mar-24 03:45 PM] talryk#0000
Workforce is pretty easy to appease at 200 out of 210


[13-Mar-24 03:45 PM] namenloss.#0000
as im in work and litle problem to connecto to Apex form here, does exist any webtool that allows to check how many free plots is left on planet?


[13-Mar-24 03:46 PM] jvaler#0000
not with an easily accessible GUI, no.
i think FIO might collect that data but i don't know how to access it because i don't know how to code


[13-Mar-24 03:47 PM] namenloss.#0000
understand


[13-Mar-24 03:48 PM] jvaler#0000
i see. well firstly a single wasted COL is nothing compared to the 750k the grant can provide lol. i wouldn't worry about it

now for it's effectiveness it can have it's uses. mainly if you are *really* hurting for logistics it can cut down on shipping, but it doesn't really save much money (unless you count slight fuel savings from less frequent import trips).

i did a quick analysis of deimos SME options here https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1183248948543098992/1203712397777313833 but i think the numbers are a bit off and/or outdated


[13-Mar-24 03:49 PM] talryk#0000
I’d have to look at FIO to see if that data exists, but if it does then getting it through a web browser would be pretty easy


[13-Mar-24 03:51 PM] talryk#0000
Oooh, I’ll recreate to see if the numbers are different.


[13-Mar-24 03:53 PM] jvaler#0000
but what's very important is maximizing expert utilization.
link to expert mechanics: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/index.html#experts

basically, you want to maximize the amount of buildings in your base that have the same expertise type (building types listed in that handbook link or ingame in a `BUI [ticker]` buffer) because you can only get the powerful 19.74% -> 28.40% efficiency bonus with a 5th expert, and you can only get a 5th expert in a single industry per base.

[13-Mar-24 03:54 PM] jvaler#0000
that's why buying and importing your ALO into a maxed out 20 SME base nets you more money than using area in your base for EXT to extract it yourself. SME and EXT buildings are separate expertise's


[13-Mar-24 03:55 PM] talryk#0000
Oh, gotcha… I already spawned up an extraction expert, at this point.


[13-Mar-24 03:55 PM] jvaler#0000
the game starts you with 1 EXT and 2 SME so that's expected


[13-Mar-24 03:55 PM] jvaler#0000

[13-Mar-24 03:56 PM] jvaler#0000
wdym 2 metallurgy?


[13-Mar-24 03:57 PM] talryk#0000
2 metallurgy experts is what I started with. Now I have those 2 plus 1 extraction.


[13-Mar-24 03:57 PM] jvaler#0000
you start with a single metallurgy expert... you probably gained a 2nd from runtime on your buildings but didn't notice


[13-Mar-24 03:58 PM] talryk#0000
Nope, I’m positive that the starter package only gave me the 2 of the same


[13-Mar-24 03:59 PM] jvaler#0000
it's not meant to give you 1 of each, you *gained* an extraction expert through running your EXT


[13-Mar-24 03:59 PM] jvaler#0000
you start with a single metallurgy expert


[13-Mar-24 04:00 PM] talryk#0000
Right, I did gain the extraction expert after, but I’m like 99% sure it started me with 2 metallurgy experts. >_>


[13-Mar-24 04:00 PM] jvaler#0000
i had the same start as you 😭 you get 1

I only have the 1 noti for the extraction dude.


[13-Mar-24 04:01 PM] jvaler#0000
according to CO you started 11 days ago. that timeline is perfectly reasonable to have earned a 2nd metallurgy expert. because 2 SME running 24/7 would double the speed you get experts, you would have gotten it within ~6 days

i thought i remember having 1


[13-Mar-24 04:07 PM] talryk#0000
Either way; does having any experts in other pools (but not active) take away from potentially gaining more in Metallurgy?


[13-Mar-24 04:07 PM] jvaler#0000
no they're all separate timers


[13-Mar-24 04:08 PM] jvaler#0000
you could have 5 experts of every single type in reserve at once even, but you could only activate 5 of a single type at any given time


[13-Mar-24 04:09 PM] talryk#0000
Oh okay, so I’m not out any chance at more of them. Okie

[23-Mar-24 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Now, I know you mentioned you aren't in ANT at the minute and would be interested in attempting to come over here for a 2nd base, but do allow me to warn you that it isn't the easiest thing to have to manage two bases like that very far apart.


[23-Mar-24 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have no issue fronting you some capital but it'd be in AIC which is only useable within ANT space and like I said, the logistics wouldn't be great due to it.


[23-Mar-24 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'd advise personally you hang on for a while before making the jump over here for your own sanity.


[23-Mar-24 06:50 PM] blueskymonster#0000
Yeah, that would basically leave me with 1 ship per base.


[23-Mar-24 06:51 PM] blueskymonster#0000
because jumping between bases wouldn't really be practical cost wise until I'm much larger


[23-Mar-24 06:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the best thing would be for me to give you roles here so you can at least see what's going on, and then whenever you are ready, giving you funding to come over here.

get LTG tf outta here 😛


[30-Mar-24 09:35 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
I do not know, I just looked at it and it was a B. Could contracts that I make affect the rating? Specifically ones that haven't been accepted?


[30-Mar-24 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
It'll be a contract you accepted from someone that breached.


[30-Mar-24 09:36 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
i only breached once


[30-Mar-24 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
That'd be it.


[30-Mar-24 09:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Could I know what it was for and why you breached it?

That's not something we encourage.


[30-Mar-24 09:38 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
it was a shipping contract, I didn't realize that the deadline was 2 days and my flight time was 3 days, held onto the materials until the contractor gave me another contract to get his materials


[30-Mar-24 09:38 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000

did your rating change as soon as you breached your contract?


[30-Mar-24 09:47 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Yeah, went down. Fixed it by not messing up other contracts


[30-Mar-24 09:51 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
how long did that take you?


[30-Mar-24 09:57 PM] bojangles_1#0000
I'll be honest, I don't remember. I don't think it took that long to fix back up though


[30-Mar-24 09:57 PM] bojangles_1#0000
If you want, I'll give you some shipping contracts to help repair your rating


[30-Mar-24 09:58 PM] bojangles_1#0000
And to get some cash in your pocket


[30-Mar-24 09:59 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
where do you need the shipping contracts to go to and fro?


[30-Mar-24 10:00 PM] bojangles_1#0000
It would be from ANT to Deimos. Won't be ready til tommorow. But if you want em, I'll send them your way


[30-Mar-24 10:02 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
I won't be able to get there in time for that contract


[30-Mar-24 10:07 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Nono, I wouldn't be ready to send you the contract til tommorow. I would max out the delivery timeline so you could send your ship as slow as you want to conserve fuel. Sorry for the confusion lol.


[30-Mar-24 10:12 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
it'd take me about 2 and a half days to just get over to Antares. Are you sure you don't need the materials that much?


[30-Mar-24 10:14 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Nope. Absolutely no rush at all. If you decide you want the contracts, or just happen to find your way over to ANT, just ping me and I'll send them to you. If you've got other things to do with your ships first, don't worry about rushing over to ANT. I can hold the materials over there for you until you need the contracts.


[30-Mar-24 10:17 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
i'll get a ship refueled and have it sent over there. Need to start making AIC anyways if I plan on expanding over there


[30-Mar-24 10:17 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Where are you based out of now?


[30-Mar-24 10:18 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
vallis/moria station


[30-Mar-24 10:20 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Oh. Ok. Hold off.


[30-Mar-24 10:21 PM] bojangles_1#0000
I have another thing you can pick up that would be ok the way


[30-Mar-24 10:21 PM] bojangles_1#0000
One sec


[30-Mar-24 10:22 PM] bojangles_1#0000
I have shit at Proxion that I could use at Deimos. Again, no rush, but it'll cut down on your trip just a little bit.


[30-Mar-24 10:22 PM] bojangles_1#0000
If your interested, I can send you the contract


[30-Mar-24 10:31 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
yeah I can do that, it would take my trip around 4 and a half days to get to deimos if i get the ship moving as soon as possible


[30-Mar-24 10:31 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Thats ok with me. Alright. Give me a minute. I'll make the contract.


[30-Mar-24 10:32 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
ok


[30-Mar-24 10:50 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Sent you a total of four contracts.


[30-Mar-24 10:50 PM] bojangles_1#0000
All Proxion to Deimos


[30-Mar-24 10:54 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
got them


[30-Mar-24 10:55 PM] bojangles_1#0000
Awesome. Should be just enough room in your ship for all of it. The value of the cargo should bump up your rating as well. So win win all around


[30-Mar-24 10:56 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
yep, came to about 450


[30-Mar-24 11:05 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000

Same with me. There was a discussion about the grant in the KAWA discord and I figured I'd join as I've been considering where to expand to next 😊


[01-Apr-24 10:21 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Your grant program is doing a great job of pulling half of KAWA into Antares, lol. So I think it's working 😆


[01-Apr-24 10:22 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
We're about to drop a lot of Antares bases though... food, Chem, carbon,  ship stuff, all sorts of things


[01-Apr-24 10:23 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
KAWA is now pretty established in 3 of 4 regions, exciting stuff


[01-Apr-24 10:24 AM] boglebogle#0000
I'd say we're barely in NEO/Moria region, maybe 6 bases across the whole corp right now.  BEN and ANT though we are pretty invested in.


[01-Apr-24 10:26 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
6 is not bad... especially with how active you and XrayD are, is consider it a pretty important region already

My only thing is with that I would be less inclined to give a grant out to someone with 20 bases and 10 ships, that kind of deal.

I have 4 (not all full) bases, and 2 ships, but yeah definitely reserve money for where it can have the most impact.

I take it based on CptColeslaw inviting you here there's the intention of you coming over to Antares, is what I gathered.


[01-Apr-24 02:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
As long as that's the case yes.


[01-Apr-24 02:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Mostly due to the fact that I ***only*** operate with AIC, and have no use nor need for any other currency, so providing grants otherwise isn't really an option unless I bother with the FX.


[01-Apr-24 02:26 PM] daniel376.#0000

what's the definition of south Antares for this action


[01-Apr-24 03:48 PM] jvaler#0000
i assume southeast, given there's a hole in the map directly south

In reality any direction you go is Antares.

o/ I kind of expected this to be a space guild but it seems like it’s a bit more complicated than that.


[04-Apr-24 01:04 PM] talryk#0000
On the contrary! It’s much less complicated; it’s not even an in-game guild, it’s just more of a collective under the same ideal: Antares development.


[04-Apr-24 01:12 PM] evany.#0000
Antares does seem to be the ah, superior sector…


[04-Apr-24 01:17 PM] talryk#0000
So it is, so it shall be. :bcaYaya3:


[04-Apr-24 01:20 PM] igfloz#0000
So, my current base consists of 2 rigs, 3 farms and 1 FP. I realise that if I want to expand I must drop more rigs (for water) - but should I diversify into an incinerator for carbon, or just keep adding rig, farm, FP and maximise ? Should Carbon production be on another base ?


[04-Apr-24 01:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Generally you want to follow the CoGC program for the planet you’re on. So assuming you’re on Harmonia you would want to make farms

{Reactions}
👍 

[04-Apr-24 01:31 PM] evany.#0000
Is there a cogc for him to do carbon somewhere ?


[04-Apr-24 01:31 PM] evany.#0000
Where it makes sense to drop a new base


[04-Apr-24 01:32 PM] talryk#0000
Incinerators are considered “Resource Extraction,” for COGC purposes. Running an INC on Harmonia isn’t bad (I currently do) to start with, but if you want to optimize then that’s what you’ll want to look for


[04-Apr-24 01:33 PM] evany.#0000
Oh so he could come to my planet deimos then


[04-Apr-24 01:33 PM] talryk#0000
Deimos runs Metallurgy


[04-Apr-24 01:33 PM] evany.#0000
Oh right.


[04-Apr-24 01:35 PM] talryk#0000
ZV-759i runs extraction, but you’d need some extra building materials due to the low temperature, and InsufFoam can be expensive.


[04-Apr-24 01:39 PM] talryk#0000
Oh, Nascent would be a good option! QJ-149c, and it’s a Goldilocks planet

[04-Apr-24 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
You are entirely correct.


[04-Apr-24 02:11 PM] jvaler#0000
nascent is the perfect INC planet cause you only need 7 ALO EXT to feed a max(20) SME AL base, and the rest of the area can be used for 14 INC, which can eat as little or as much agri as you can feed it depending on which C recipes you choose


[04-Apr-24 02:12 PM] talryk#0000
:noted:


[04-Apr-24 02:12 PM] evany.#0000
well we are both kinda brand new 10-15 days old ish so second base is a long ways away yet


[04-Apr-24 02:16 PM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah nascent would be a ways away for y'all. not just from construction costs but also the logi required to feed that kind of base.

if you're harmonia to be honest i'd recommend food processing on norwick as your next target instead of nascent. easier to startup, less logi, and arguably more profitable if you choose what you make strategically

definitely focus on maxing out the 500 area of your starter base first though


[04-Apr-24 02:16 PM] evany.#0000
he's harmonia i'm deimos


[04-Apr-24 02:17 PM] evany.#0000
aside from buying more smelters and habs and extractors to keep the smelters fed i'm not really sure what kind of direction i should take


[04-Apr-24 02:19 PM] jvaler#0000
the best second base for a deimos start imo is making BFABs on nike. iirc you can make ~80k/d with a minmaxed 500 area PP2 base there, which is really solid. better than deimos by ~30k/d, even


[04-Apr-24 02:20 PM] jvaler#0000
it happens to consume the AL you make on deimos which is nice


[04-Apr-24 02:20 PM] evany.#0000
i meant for scaling my first base in deimos


[04-Apr-24 02:20 PM] evany.#0000
just scale ext and sme ?


[04-Apr-24 02:21 PM] jvaler#0000
oh, well you answered that yourself. basically yeah.


[04-Apr-24 02:22 PM] jvaler#0000
if you want to squeeze a little more profit out of your base it's better to go for 20 SME and buying your ALO on the LM instead of splitting between SME+EXT. but it's only a loss of like ~5k/d and it's understandable to take that tradeoff in favor of less micromanaging


[04-Apr-24 02:23 PM] jvaler#0000
said deimos LM ALO goes for ~75 AIC/u


[04-Apr-24 02:23 PM] evany.#0000
I saw someone selling batches of 400


[04-Apr-24 02:23 PM] evany.#0000
300*


[04-Apr-24 02:23 PM] evany.#0000
I couldn’t afford it though


[04-Apr-24 02:24 PM] evany.#0000
He wanted like 26k I think on local


[04-Apr-24 02:24 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't happen to make any surplus ALO, but if you have an emergency i can tide you over for a bit because i have my own 20 SME base on deimos too


[04-Apr-24 02:25 PM] jvaler#0000

86.67


[04-Apr-24 02:25 PM] jvaler#0000
sounds about right. bit less than the ~95/u on the CX rn and the difference would account for the fuel costs in shipping it


[04-Apr-24 02:26 PM] jvaler#0000
at least it was ~95 last i checked


[04-Apr-24 02:26 PM] evany.#0000
im good. i didn't have premium yet back when i built this plan so i've been scaling extractor to smelter


[04-Apr-24 02:27 PM] evany.#0000
so far 2 extractors 3 smelters. need to add 1 more smelter when i get the materials

[04-Apr-24 07:32 PM] jvaler#0000
didn't say the bfabs were worse, the PP2 is worse. cause you're paying the same consumables/d and degradation/d(ik nike is SEA, +60% efficiency is more than worth it) for less production/d.

what does this mean


[19-Apr-24 01:33 PM] jvaler#0000
there's a surprising number of players who do *everything* on phobos very inefficiently, like EXT, RIG, FRM, and FP. doing all of these neglects the bonus from your experts and neglects the bonus from the CoGC
that's all, nothing against you
and for all i know you only have FP which isn't all that bad. DW used to be hot a few weeks ago before it's price dropped back down


[19-Apr-24 01:34 PM] thermosnack#0000

[19-Apr-24 01:38 PM] thermosnack#0000
but im here now and I am making scanners


[19-Apr-24 01:39 PM] jvaler#0000
deimos being full is exactly why you want to start there. when you start your first base you are able to bypass the plot limit, but any secondary bases you build cannot be built on full planets


[19-Apr-24 01:39 PM] thermosnack#0000
see the game did not say that


[19-Apr-24 01:40 PM] thermosnack#0000
I was like "why would I choose to start on a planet that I cant fit on" lol


[19-Apr-24 01:40 PM] jvaler#0000
it doesn't say a lot of things unfortunately

Finished! I'll probably be upgrading to pro shortly here if needed. I am however more interested in your GAS project. As loyal Antares citizen pursuing metalworking for the purpose of ship building I may in time be able to help with such.


[20-Apr-24 09:58 PM] seacilia#0000
What's it all about if I may ask?


[20-Apr-24 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
GAS is currently on a hiatus due to the previous leader of it quitting the game.


[20-Apr-24 09:59 PM] seacilia#0000
Ah I see


[20-Apr-24 09:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
There's some plans floating around here and there but nothing concrete as a supplement to it.


[20-Apr-24 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although if that's a focus point for you there's several individuals here who I'm sure would like to work on something smaller scale with you.


[20-Apr-24 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
And of course planning and suggestions are always welcome and encouraged.

We do have semi regular shipping around ANT that we are working on formalising more, though, as our current main focus.

is Griffonstone part of GAS?


[21-Apr-24 11:15 AM] blatt.laus#0000
I would like to setup a base there


[21-Apr-24 11:25 AM] flor2081#0000

[21-Apr-24 11:26 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Technically when GAS was a thing everywhere int ANT space was apart of it


[21-Apr-24 11:27 AM] blatt.laus#0000
or is Griffonstone valid to get a grant?


[21-Apr-24 11:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
As long as your base plan gets approved by Australis. he might provide some suggestions to your base plan


[23-Apr-24 07:04 AM] blatt.laus#0000
@Deleted User what do you think about a base on Griffonstone for FLX/PG/NS production?


[23-Apr-24 07:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Sounds reasonable to do.


[23-Apr-24 07:09 AM] blatt.laus#0000
is it possible to get a grant for that base?

i canceled all my prod and destroyed all my buildings.


[09-May-24 12:59 PM] antisyntax#0000
so  iguess now i got to sell the mats at AI CX to pay it off?


[09-May-24 01:00 PM] antisyntax#0000
that may take several hours of flight time


[09-May-24 01:00 PM] jvaler#0000

oh yeah that'll cover 100k


[09-May-24 01:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
though what we could do.


[09-May-24 01:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
is you could do the grant now, that way i can pay it off now, coliq immediately and start up immedately


[09-May-24 01:01 PM] jvaler#0000
the bfabs alone should do it


[09-May-24 01:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
that way we don't have to liquidate the materials first to pay off the loan to liquidate the rest


[09-May-24 01:01 PM] jvaler#0000
if we do the grant before you coliq that money would be lost 😛


[09-May-24 01:01 PM] antisyntax#0000
oh really?


[09-May-24 01:01 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah, it's a full reset

[09-May-24 01:02 PM] antisyntax#0000
true


[09-May-24 01:03 PM] antisyntax#0000
well if its a full reset then i don't have to worry about conserving fuel

In this case it'd be best to just fly there directly I'd imagine.

Hi Australis. I'm not really here for anything in particular. I'm just looking around to see what's up. Found you all through the UFO discord, and this discord through Deimos chat. 

I'm currently on Deimos smelting CU and AL. I'm kinda short on long term goals so I was hoping to find some here 😉

Hi all! Sorry that you all haven't been roled, but I'm here to process you now :P
If you don't mind I could use a refresher on what y'all are looking for here(new server owner). And for those without their company code in their nickname `[Username] | [CO Code]` adding that would be helpful!

i hate dyno. maybe i will end up replacing it


[03-Jun-24 08:39 AM] jvaler#0000
@neeko.cat hello! welcome to ADI. to see the rest of the server you will be manually roled. but first, please tell us about what you do ingame! do you have any plans? and what are you looking for from ADI?
and secondly, please change your nickname to the `[Username] | [Company ID]` format to more easily identify you and look up your company ingame.

please ping me when you're ready!


[03-Jun-24 08:44 AM] neeko.cat#0000
Hi!! Well... currently my plan is to get a plan :D I'm kinda lost and someone from the KAWA corp invited me here!! I have a base in prom with some players (HCC from the Aluminum Alliance)  and another random base i just started in yi-280d


[03-Jun-24 08:45 AM] neeko.cat#0000
I guess I am looking for guidance & money? :D ||and hopefully get to meet nice people :)?||


[03-Jun-24 08:47 AM] neeko.cat#0000
oh and @jvaler the ping you requested c:


[03-Jun-24 08:48 AM] neeko.cat#0000
:ping:


[03-Jun-24 08:49 AM] jvaler#0000
AA is good people, why all the way over in YI though? that's on the entire other side of the map from prom


[03-Jun-24 08:51 AM] neeko.cat#0000
because 
1. my prom base is self-sufficient and needs 0 ships around thanks to the AA people
2. I made a friend there that is willing to buy the stuff i produce right on that planet, since shipping wasn't an issue i just went for it


[03-Jun-24 08:51 AM] neeko.cat#0000
but


[03-Jun-24 08:51 AM] neeko.cat#0000
this clearly shows i dont have a plan


[03-Jun-24 08:51 AM] neeko.cat#0000
so this is why im here i guess!


[03-Jun-24 08:51 AM] jvaler#0000
self sufficient in HCC...? you still need to ship consumables though?


[03-Jun-24 08:52 AM] neeko.cat#0000
yeah, but i buy em in the LM


[03-Jun-24 08:52 AM] jvaler#0000
oh interesting


[03-Jun-24 08:52 AM] neeko.cat#0000
prom is next to HRT


[03-Jun-24 08:52 AM] neeko.cat#0000
so i can do that very cheap, not to mention some people produces the consumables in prom directly


[03-Jun-24 08:53 AM] jvaler#0000
alright, well seeing as you're not antarian or planning to become one, i think associate role will work for you


[03-Jun-24 08:53 AM] neeko.cat#0000
and the HCC guys bring me the H2O and DDT i need to run my base


[03-Jun-24 08:53 AM] neeko.cat#0000
and pick up my HER in prom


[03-Jun-24 08:53 AM] jvaler#0000
you should have access to the rest of the server now


[03-Jun-24 08:54 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i am actually planning to become one c:


[03-Jun-24 08:54 AM] neeko.cat#0000
just


[03-Jun-24 08:54 AM] jvaler#0000
oh?


[03-Jun-24 08:54 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i have the prom base there and my plan is to forget it exists and just receive the passive income


[03-Jun-24 08:55 AM] neeko.cat#0000
and then start a bunch of bases in the antares region


[03-Jun-24 08:55 AM] jvaler#0000
oh i love that


[03-Jun-24 08:55 AM] jvaler#0000
exactly what HCC is good for


[03-Jun-24 08:56 AM] jvaler#0000
so you plan on getting an AGP grant?


[03-Jun-24 08:56 AM] neeko.cat#0000
idk feels bad to ask for money just like that


[03-Jun-24 08:57 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i first want a plan and also i would like to give back what i get


[03-Jun-24 08:57 AM] neeko.cat#0000
either in money or in a more abstract way helping you in some way


[03-Jun-24 08:57 AM] jvaler#0000
you *can* repay it if you really want to, but it's not really necessary


[03-Jun-24 08:58 AM] neeko.cat#0000
from where do you get that money? someone has to pay for it!


[03-Jun-24 08:58 AM] jvaler#0000
i mostly get it from CAAP :^]


[03-Jun-24 08:58 AM] jvaler#0000
AFABs are big money


[03-Jun-24 08:59 AM] neeko.cat#0000
dunno what that is :D


[03-Jun-24 08:59 AM] jvaler#0000
another AA co-op


[03-Jun-24 08:59 AM] neeko.cat#0000
ohh


[03-Jun-24 08:59 AM] neeko.cat#0000
nice


[03-Jun-24 08:59 AM] neeko.cat#0000
so you pay the grants directly from your pocket


[03-Jun-24 08:59 AM] jvaler#0000
mhm


[03-Jun-24 08:59 AM] jvaler#0000
some other members here pitch in too


[03-Jun-24 09:00 AM] neeko.cat#0000
if one day i become an established player in this game i'll probably want to pitch in too


[03-Jun-24 09:00 AM] neeko.cat#0000
kinda new as of now

so what planet do you have in mind?


[03-Jun-24 09:00 AM] neeko.cat#0000
in KAWA they gave me two ideas


[03-Jun-24 09:01 AM] neeko.cat#0000
one is a chem base?

[03-Jun-24 09:02 AM] neeko.cat#0000
maybe in griffonstone?


[03-Jun-24 09:02 AM] jvaler#0000
popular choice, though i'm not familiar with the profitability of chem. i've heard good things about it from others though


[03-Jun-24 09:03 AM] jvaler#0000
personally heph is one of my favorites. BMPs are very profitable if you pick the right products


[03-Jun-24 09:03 AM] neeko.cat#0000
interesting


[03-Jun-24 09:04 AM] neeko.cat#0000
they also said they needed a software base but that it was super expensive


[03-Jun-24 09:04 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i like the idea but ain't got the funds so i guess i'll do it at some point


[03-Jun-24 09:05 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i have very basic bases now producing directly from raw materials so maybe now i want to produce more complex goods


[03-Jun-24 09:05 AM] jvaler#0000
manufacturing does exactly that!


[03-Jun-24 09:06 AM] jvaler#0000
though those resources aren't really yours are they? cause they're contractually owned by either HCC or your other trading partner


[03-Jun-24 09:06 AM] jvaler#0000
not that you'd want to ship them all the way over to ANT anyways


[03-Jun-24 09:08 AM] neeko.cat#0000
HCC yeah, the yi-280d base i have i extract LIO and TIO and refine it into LI and TI so they're mine


[03-Jun-24 09:08 AM] jvaler#0000
you said you have someone buying that off of you though?


[03-Jun-24 09:08 AM] neeko.cat#0000
yeah, but there's no contract


[03-Jun-24 09:09 AM] neeko.cat#0000
we just find a price thats good for both


[03-Jun-24 09:09 AM] neeko.cat#0000
and that's it


[03-Jun-24 09:09 AM] jvaler#0000
well no literal contract, but an agreement? or can you just walk away lol


[03-Jun-24 09:10 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i'd prefer to keep trading with him because he's nice but im pretty sure it wouldn't be a super big deal if i tell him i gotta leave


[03-Jun-24 09:10 AM] neeko.cat#0000
our agreement is like "produce whatever you can and i'll adapt to it"


[03-Jun-24 09:10 AM] jvaler#0000
inch resting


[03-Jun-24 09:11 AM] jvaler#0000
well unfortunately i can't recommend shipping LI & TI into ANT from YI so...


[03-Jun-24 09:11 AM] neeko.cat#0000
nah looks like a nightmare


[03-Jun-24 09:11 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i have some free permits tho


[03-Jun-24 09:11 AM] neeko.cat#0000
two to be exact


[03-Jun-24 09:12 AM] neeko.cat#0000
and 800k ICA to invest


[03-Jun-24 09:12 AM] jvaler#0000
800k? that's plenty to get something going on a triple green planet


[03-Jun-24 09:13 AM] jvaler#0000
basically a full FRM base on harmonia right there


[03-Jun-24 09:13 AM] jvaler#0000
or like 15 BMPs on heph


[03-Jun-24 09:13 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i've seen enough FRM for now :D

[03-Jun-24 09:14 AM] jvaler#0000
well you could have it producing for you instead 🤷‍♀️


[03-Jun-24 09:14 AM] jvaler#0000
just presenting options


[03-Jun-24 09:14 AM] neeko.cat#0000
oh that's a nice idea


[03-Jun-24 09:14 AM] neeko.cat#0000
and if i do this, what should i produce?


[03-Jun-24 09:16 AM] jvaler#0000
your choice! there's lots of agency in what you do that you can't get from a base bound up in co-op obligations. the profit analysis is up to you

[03-Jun-24 09:18 AM] jvaler#0000
though note not all of those recipes are really viable. for example, PT made with tungsten is incredibly expensive. i don't think the devs did a proper balance pass with some alternate recipes offered in the game :P


[03-Jun-24 09:19 AM] neeko.cat#0000
woah the sea numbers look great in there


[03-Jun-24 09:20 AM] jvaler#0000
they certainly do. but you need to double check anything that stands out for erroneous market data. there could have been a sharp but temporary price dip/hike skewing the data collected


[03-Jun-24 09:21 AM] neeko.cat#0000
fair, and i guess if i buy the stuff from a CX then im more versatile and i can always swap producs


[03-Jun-24 09:21 AM] neeko.cat#0000
right?


[03-Jun-24 09:22 AM] jvaler#0000
correct!


[03-Jun-24 09:22 AM] jvaler#0000
not being locked in by bases you already made lets you navigate the waves of the market much easier


[03-Jun-24 09:23 AM] neeko.cat#0000
and i could save the profit of this base to build a more expensive one like the software base they said


[03-Jun-24 09:24 AM] jvaler#0000
if you want 🤷‍♀️ i personally dislike electronics. bad vibes in the recipes, too many materials that exist solely to make other single purpose materials


[03-Jun-24 09:26 AM] neeko.cat#0000
What am i missing? 👀 maybe the upkeep/consumables?

[03-Jun-24 09:26 AM] neeko.cat#0000
oh


[03-Jun-24 09:26 AM] neeko.cat#0000
i get it


[03-Jun-24 09:27 AM] neeko.cat#0000
what high level base do you suggest for me in the future?


[03-Jun-24 09:27 AM] neeko.cat#0000
:D


[03-Jun-24 09:48 AM] jvaler#0000
thing is, higher level doesnt always equate to more profitable. but if you want a high tier goal, AMLs have good profit numbers iirc


[03-Jun-24 10:08 AM] neeko.cat#0000
yeah im aware, it's just to have a feeling of self accomplishment or something, i'll look at those :)


[03-Jun-24 11:12 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
KAWA also needs a few AMLs so that's definitely a solid choice if you're interested in getting there faster...


[03-Jun-24 11:12 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
also 800k will buy you *2* FRM bases with KAWA prices thank you very much @jvaler 😝


[03-Jun-24 11:12 AM] flor2081#0000
damn


[03-Jun-24 11:12 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but yeah, chem is usually very profitable. in KAWA we also have a good opportunity to make EPO right now that would be great money


[03-Jun-24 11:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah I just bought 2 full FRM bases and 2 full INC bases for like 2 mil and it surprised even me...


[03-Jun-24 11:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's even including consumables...


[03-Jun-24 11:13 AM] flor2081#0000
oh with consumables??


[03-Jun-24 11:13 AM] flor2081#0000
wow thats half market price


[03-Jun-24 11:13 AM] flor2081#0000
nice


[03-Jun-24 11:14 AM] flor2081#0000
i should join kawa too 😂


[03-Jun-24 11:14 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
most of our prices are around 1/3 CX. our approach definitely has some cons too, but it's a *fantastic* system for being able to invest in new players really efficiently


[03-Jun-24 11:15 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
1/3 input costs for 1/3 profits too usually, so it's a tradeoff for a different style of play


[03-Jun-24 11:15 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the main benefit being fast expansion that's pretty easy to budget for

[03-Jun-24 11:17 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but when your corp has a C shortage and you can fund 4 whole bases with just repair parts and cash you have on hand... that's pretty nice 😆


[03-Jun-24 11:17 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah indeed lol


[03-Jun-24 11:18 AM] acramernc#0000
i'm curious, does KAWA have some kind of overarching production tracker to help ensure that all the higher level items have sufficient input


[03-Jun-24 11:19 AM] acramernc#0000
or is it more of a "oops we're out of carbon, lets make more" kinda situation


[03-Jun-24 11:19 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but we really have to build up every bit of infrastructure internally for it to work, so with a huge wave of new players a few months ago, and a lot of them getting into higher tier stuff now, it's been an interesting puzzle trying to figure out the order in which to build things


[03-Jun-24 11:21 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
a bit of both. we've got teams for different end product markets (consumables, base building/repair, shipbuilding, and governor needs) and those teams take responsibility for trying to keep tabs on overall excess/need for each. It's actually a relatively new system but been really effective.

until this year we were small enough that the "oops we're running out" approach was fine. Not so much anymore


[03-Jun-24 11:22 AM] acramernc#0000
this sounds like peak multi-spreadsheet wonder potential


[03-Jun-24 11:23 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I've shifted my company to act as a sort of 'safety net'. I do a lot more external trading than most of KAWA. The extra profit I make from selling cheap input products for higher out-of-corp prices goes to filling temporary gaps in our production. Like we don't have PDA production yet but we need that consumable. I buy it on CX, sell it at lower KAWA prices, then sell some of my own excess to make up for it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ so there's a bit of flexibility now


[03-Jun-24 11:23 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
oh there's a lot of spreadsheet tools 😆 and we're always working on more. lots of really smart people in KAWA with some amazing dev skills so things just keep improving


[03-Jun-24 11:24 AM] lossi#0000


[03-Jun-24 11:25 AM] lossi#0000
So that's where my competitors are


[03-Jun-24 11:26 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think the sheet I'm personally most proud of is this one that I use for that external trading. It calculates the price difference between KAWA and the CX average to give me a sorted list of what the most profitable things to trade are.

I can check boxes on the left to say what I have excess of and what I want to buy. Then it makes a list of items for trading

I had a bit too much fun with that one, lol. but it's useful


[03-Jun-24 11:28 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
in what market? we don't really do much public trading so we can be friends 💚 😆


[03-Jun-24 11:28 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the excess that we make I often sell here for pretty cheap


[03-Jun-24 11:29 AM] lossi#0000
Nah I make a lot of sheets and programs on our side


[03-Jun-24 11:32 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000

and for a browser based game it just makes sense


[03-Jun-24 12:43 PM] acramernc#0000
i've touched appscripts a couple times, its powerful but it's kinda clunky the way it's integrated


[03-Jun-24 12:43 PM] lossi#0000
It can be, but it can also get you in a lot of trouble


[03-Jun-24 12:44 PM] lossi#0000
Especially if you try to treat it like JS


[03-Jun-24 12:44 PM] acramernc#0000
google is SUPER concerned with the fact that it's arbitrary js code lol


[03-Jun-24 12:44 PM] acramernc#0000
and it doesn't run on mobile at all


[03-Jun-24 12:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it's necessary to some degree once you start trying to solve specific problems for PrUn. Since there's some FIO endpoints that aren't in CSV format to pull with a simple IMPORTDATA()


[03-Jun-24 12:45 PM] lossi#0000
If you enjoy coding on mobile, just take a whip to yourself instead :worry:

@jvaler you think we could get a channel for tool development?


[03-Jun-24 12:51 PM] acramernc#0000
yeah i'm down, could potetially get saganaki / piboy to make a sheets channel in the PCT discord


[03-Jun-24 12:51 PM] acramernc#0000
much easier for me to work on sheets in my spare time than pmmg lol


[03-Jun-24 12:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
there's already a lot of spreadsheet tools out there, some of them are pinned in the tools channel there, some are just pinned in random research channels. I'll try to share what I know of and made myself when I get a chance


[03-Jun-24 01:09 PM] lossi#0000
Not to reinvent the wheel or anything, but having a single condensed "administrative" sheet would probably have high demand

agreed. this is what I've tried to implement in KAWA so I completely agree. Especially since most tools are referencing a lot of the same data, it's nice to have a 'dev sheet' too with everything pulled and ready to mess around with

to be fair onjoin messages are notoriously bad. people are so desensitized to it i personally rarely read them when joining a discord when i'm searching for an answer for something.


[07-Jun-24 11:20 PM] tanda#0000
I know a couple servers that just have splash pages you can't get past until you react to them. Makes it pretty hard to not read what the page is saying

[08-Jun-24 12:48 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think its fine


[08-Jun-24 08:59 AM] jvaler#0000
if we were a "community server" we would have some more fancy options, but i don't wanna make it public


[08-Jun-24 09:07 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think there is a way to do that but be private? Or at least something similar


[08-Jun-24 09:07 AM] .shiva.#0000
"community server" may not really mean what you think it does, it doesn't inherently make the server public


[08-Jun-24 09:07 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I looked into it for a club’s server that I ran a bit ago


[08-Jun-24 09:08 AM] .shiva.#0000
Theres a *separate* discovery option you turn on to make it public (which this server isn't even big enough to do so, im pretty sure)


[08-Jun-24 09:08 AM] .shiva.#0000
Tbh there's no real downside to turning it on


[08-Jun-24 09:11 AM] .shiva.#0000
Enabling would give forum channels and builtin landing pages and what not

Hi. I've started a base at Promitor and built up a small C production there. I'm looking to build a second base to diversify my income. I've tried to settle at Vallis, and now I know what the heck a ghost plot is and how all this sucks. Antares planets looks like an alternative, and I would like to build some power tools production there. I already have base materials, and my ship is flying towards Phobos, but I'm open to financial help if that's available.


[15-Jun-24 09:51 AM] igfloz#0000

Hephaestus is the better planet for PT I think - It already has Manufacturing bonus. Phobos is Electronics ....I think ? One of the Coordinators can offer help / advice on financials / grants etc.

um, I'm not extremely familiar with all the planets in ant, but I'd recommend doing a COLIQ and starting again on deimos

Yeah


[15-Jun-24 01:18 PM] flor2081#0000

i was looking a deimos


[15-Jun-24 01:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You won’t be able to make a base on Deimos unless you COLIQ


[15-Jun-24 01:19 PM] flor2081#0000
you can always expand into phobos later, but you cant expand into deimos anymore since it's full (your first planet ignores this plot limit)


[15-Jun-24 01:19 PM] boog.wav#0000
oh


[15-Jun-24 01:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Harmonia - Agri, Hephaestus-Manufacturing, Phobos - electronics, thats all the boosts I know off the top of my head

gotcha

~~yup that's all 3 ANT starters https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUmjz8XNgLJ6y_XJa_hn7JPc9FWftqR2Lx9McZi-X-0/edit?gid=0#gid=0~~


[15-Jun-24 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
wait i misread you


[15-Jun-24 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
heph isn't a starter


[15-Jun-24 01:23 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah


[15-Jun-24 01:23 PM] flor2081#0000
haha i was thinking what you meant


[15-Jun-24 01:23 PM] igfloz#0000
sorry, my bad. I wasn't thinking of starter planets, just my interactions so far, lol


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] boog.wav#0000
so by this chart i would want to start as metal and expand to victualler?


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or something else too


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] boog.wav#0000
i am understanding!!!


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] boog.wav#0000
lol


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Stuff that uses the metals you make can also be really good


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So construction or manufacturing


[15-Jun-24 01:24 PM] flor2081#0000
not necessarily expanding into victualler, you can kinda choose whatever at that point


[15-Jun-24 01:25 PM] boog.wav#0000
does this corp have an active vc where people just hangout and talk abou the game?


[15-Jun-24 01:25 PM] flor2081#0000
it makes more sense to expand to construction, as you're already making the base metals for bfabs as metallurgist


[15-Jun-24 01:25 PM] jvaler#0000
it doesn't, but i can give you associate role to see the rest of the server. you seem fit for it

[15-Jun-24 01:27 PM] boog.wav#0000

what are you looking for?


[20-Jun-24 05:52 PM] jvaler#0000
a role system that isn't reaction based, similar to the rank system used by UFO. this way we can have the 2 dozen planet roles and not need 2 dozen emoji reactions

dyno had something that would have worked, the /rank system, but it's been broken for weeks and i don't expect it to be fixed anytime soon


[20-Jun-24 05:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[20-Jun-24 05:57 PM] jvaler#0000
i could force it to work with sapphire's custom commands feature... but that's tedious and jank


[20-Jun-24 05:57 PM] jvaler#0000

I'm located at Phobos, making C atm. Thinking of finding a good agricultural planet to start as a second base. Currently saving AIC for that purpose. Looking for good deals and helping out. And maybe get rich along the way. @jvaler

we do have an internal market to help you save costs on consumables: #internal-offers

@ratgorwesbar Harmonia is the Agriculture planet you are looking for 😄


[22-Jun-24 01:20 PM] igfloz#0000
FRM, not HYF !


[22-Jun-24 01:21 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Was FRM i was looking to build


[22-Jun-24 01:21 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Atm i feel settlers are too steep to get into


[22-Jun-24 01:22 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, they chug Kombucha


[22-Jun-24 01:26 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
See that in the internal offers plenty ahave C on the "cheap" but no one have GRN, HCP or MAI. Do everyone make it to self consume?


[22-Jun-24 01:27 PM] tanda#0000
yes, in general


[22-Jun-24 01:27 PM] tanda#0000
one full base of FRM makes just about enough GRN to burn


[22-Jun-24 01:27 PM] igfloz#0000
I make GRN, but I supply a customer


[22-Jun-24 01:27 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
You only burn C with one ingredient??


[22-Jun-24 01:28 PM] tanda#0000
yes, it keeps the cost down


[22-Jun-24 01:28 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Yeah but with three you get higher supply


[22-Jun-24 01:28 PM] tanda#0000
I run a full 32 INC to compensate for how slow it is


[22-Jun-24 01:28 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, but this is permit efficient


[22-Jun-24 01:29 PM] tanda#0000
running even double burn, you'd need to triple permit Harmonia to have enough supply to run... sorry I've forgotten the break point


[22-Jun-24 01:30 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
With 32 INC you'll need 96 FRM's to have enough burn right??


[22-Jun-24 03:36 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If you're running the 4 H2O -> 4 GRN recipe and only burning single ingredient C then you only need 13-14 FRM to supply 30 INC. It's the most cost effective setup. If you're burning 3-ingredient C then you want to use HYF for the HCP and MAI. For that you'd want a water base too probably.


[22-Jun-24 03:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If you're only using FRMs though then I'd recommend the single ingredient carbon recipe


[24-Jun-24 05:04 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
k thx for input, i think i need to go back to singel burn, just to lower my expensens and increase my overhead so i can expand to a second planet

How does it work around here?


[24-Jun-24 08:57 PM] jcheung#0000
started zv-759c (Deimos) metallurgy

intend to build PP2, and fab some of the materials i'll need for other buildings.
have purchased PP2 materials and they arrive in about 10 minutes.
purchased also some materials to process for the PP2.

intend next to drop a settler hab to bring PP2 to full operations instead of half
then after that, a BMP for more construction fabs. sell refined AL up in.... whatever that market is to the north, don't feel like looking it up right now.
add SMEs and EXTs as i gain resources to do so until limit is reached.
build up stockpile for expansion.

start 2nd base in zv-307b (Bober) and focus on chemicals. start one each POL and CHP, rotate POL between PG and EPO. rotate CHP between FLX (for 1st base), NS, SC, and salt.
build more POL and CHP as resources are available. last building lab, just to see if i can make a buck with lab

base 3, zv-307c (Hephaestus) focus mfg. start one each BMP, WPL. BMP focus on PWO and PT, occasional OVE and EXO as well. all four to supply other bases. WPL cycle between COT and NL. COT to feed BMP.
build more of each as resources available.
cycle back to base 1 and strip BMPs to replace with more SME and EXTs
top off with CLF to see how bad an idea LCs are


[24-Jun-24 08:57 PM] jcheung#0000
that's my current plan


[24-Jun-24 08:59 PM] jcheung#0000
end should, according to prunplanner kick out around 60-80k per base/day, excluding b1-that'll only be around 30k
that said, i'm expecting it to produce less


[24-Jun-24 08:59 PM] jvaler#0000
we've got a pretty active community of people working to make the game interesting and/or easier. there's opportunities to make favorable trades with others, collaborate on group production projects, and for new players you can apply for the 750k AGP grant!


[24-Jun-24 09:00 PM] jvaler#0000
there's also a subsidized internal market where you can buy cheaper essential goods from more established players


[24-Jun-24 09:03 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Well I can do a proper presentation myself. 

I started on Deimos as well about 5 days ago. Raised 3.5M$ to setup 30 Smelters and a Alo base on Nascent. Raised the funds be pre-selling a good chunk of the AL to be produced in the next month. Total production is about 280 AL / day for a PRUNplanner profit of 120k/day

I'm currently ironing out the logisitics and making sure things a running smoothly. Iv got 1 WCB already, before expanding more i would need a second one. Then iv got a Agri/Inc chain planned that i gonna take a loan for. Should produce 200C at the end of the day, covering my C needs and a good chunk to sell as well.

I used to do alot of trading on my last account but this time i want to do more production. 

I'd be very interested in the 750k grant. Dont know how that works


[24-Jun-24 09:04 PM] jvaler#0000
PP2 are definitely moneymakers. though i'm a bit concerned with all the multi-industry buildings you plan to put on deimos. PP2 are reasonable to put down despite not aligning with CoGC/experts because they're just so good, but the other buildings not so much.
EXT are pretty low profit buildings unless you make the whole base specialize into resource extraction. and i'm not sure why you'd put a BMP on deimos either...


[24-Jun-24 09:06 PM] jcheung#0000
ALO EXTs pull in a good chunk of change right now


[24-Jun-24 09:07 PM] jcheung#0000
the BMP is because i don't have pro and therefore don't have someone to bankroll me. saving 500 AIC per material to trade for time is worth it to me right now unless i hear otherwise
well. maybe not 500 each, but you get the idea


[24-Jun-24 09:07 PM] jvaler#0000
3.5mil? wow, who'd you get that from?

unfortunately i think that'd exclude you from the AGP grant lol, that's more meant for getting new players their starter base maxed out in area


[24-Jun-24 09:08 PM] jvaler#0000
what do you mean by "saving per material to trade for time"?


[24-Jun-24 09:09 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
From players I traded alot with last time. I plan to leverage it into a lowstrife loan


[24-Jun-24 09:11 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Aside from the loan, I never really did the whole corp thing before so im also looking for a community to play with


[24-Jun-24 09:12 PM] tanda#0000
we're not a pure corp (we have one internally) but we are a loose federation of people just trying to help each other out


[24-Jun-24 09:12 PM] jvaler#0000
alright, you should have access to the server now. there's currently an INS production project about to start up being headed by DvorakDwarf, though i'm not sure how many spots are still available for it


[24-Jun-24 09:12 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
thats really what im looking for


[24-Jun-24 09:13 PM] tanda#0000
the scope of that just expanded greatly, Project kevin should be looking for at least another 3-4 bases


[24-Jun-24 09:15 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, so... MCG right now on market runs 35 AIC/ea.
for b1 plans i need around... 1.4k currently. i think. that's 14 runs
buying the raw materials will cost me.... 9k for lime, 3k for silicon. building the BMP would run me around...23k.
combined investment, 35k and 7 days.
buying the MCG straight would cost me 44k+.


[24-Jun-24 09:15 PM] jvaler#0000
sorry uh... what's b1?


[24-Jun-24 09:15 PM] jcheung#0000
starter


[24-Jun-24 09:15 PM] jvaler#0000
ah


[24-Jun-24 09:16 PM] jcheung#0000
now if i were to scrape up funds for pro and get a grant, i would redo how this base is built entirely, but... penny pinch mode


[24-Jun-24 09:16 PM] tanda#0000
if you're still here in a week, I can give you a month of pro free


[24-Jun-24 09:17 PM] tanda#0000
though this game sounds like it has its hooks in you already


[24-Jun-24 09:17 PM] jcheung#0000
~~tempting~~


[24-Jun-24 09:18 PM] jvaler#0000
lemme pull up prunplanner, something sounds off


[24-Jun-24 09:18 PM] jcheung#0000
hey, i could be wrong


[24-Jun-24 09:18 PM] tanda#0000
something to note about PRO|Basic is that if you pay for PRO, you'll go back to basic afterwards. With any player codes, you go back to free afterwards


[24-Jun-24 09:18 PM] jcheung#0000
i'll happily take feedback


[24-Jun-24 09:19 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
How would such a project work?


[24-Jun-24 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
we are being funded in part by PiBoy, and the other part by sidepipe. It is loans based, so just let DvorakDwarf know you're interested after reading through some backlogs


[24-Jun-24 09:20 PM] jvaler#0000
hm actually you're right... a ROI period of ~7 days is super good
BMPs are just that good i suppose

it just kinda goes against instinct to have manufacturing on Deimos, huh

that assumes current market prices hold, ofc


[24-Jun-24 09:20 PM] jvaler#0000

[24-Jun-24 09:21 PM] jcheung#0000
i also fully intend to remove the BMPs once i have a replacement


[24-Jun-24 09:22 PM] jvaler#0000
everything involved in this chain is pretty stable. i think it's a pretty good idea

yeah that heph base is gonna be a super money maker


[24-Jun-24 09:23 PM] jvaler#0000
both BMPs and WPLs are very powerful


[24-Jun-24 09:23 PM] jcheung#0000
i have no idea how well the LCs will sell. it'll either be just okay and feed my other bases, or really really good for me...


[24-Jun-24 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
or i could remove that entirely 🤔


[24-Jun-24 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
slot in another BMP or something


[24-Jun-24 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
burn that bridge when i get to it. it's like 3.5m AIC worth of resources away from me right now... if i have it done in half a year i'll be surprised


[24-Jun-24 09:25 PM] jvaler#0000
that would be an issue due to how spotty the CXPC graph for LC is, but the fact that there's a relatively small spread on the CXOB you'd be fine just selling to the bid. which is rare... bids are usually ass :P

[24-Jun-24 09:25 PM] jcheung#0000
hmm. fair


[24-Jun-24 09:26 PM] jvaler#0000
the crafting recipe for LC just seems a bit needlessly complicated for a brand new player. i'm worried the cost to buffer those inputs could be difficult for you


[24-Jun-24 09:28 PM] jcheung#0000
that's why i chose to make it the end of base 3. going to be a while before i get there i think


[24-Jun-24 09:29 PM] jcheung#0000
that said i might have to fly to other exchanges to actually get some of the goodies i need 😬


[24-Jun-24 09:30 PM] jcheung#0000
in theory by the time i get to that i'll be putting out enough from other sources that if it fails miserably it'll just be a lesson.


[24-Jun-24 09:31 PM] jcheung#0000
an expensive one, sure

by doing profitable things to bolster antares economic growth. we have to prepare for annexation of insitor space after all...


[24-Jun-24 09:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We're planning out a bunch of bases for different goals, so you can help manage one when you are ready


[24-Jun-24 09:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But yeah if you are a new player it's better to at least get one solid base going


[24-Jun-24 09:40 PM] jvaler#0000

[25-Jun-24 11:03 AM] nyanism#0000
the problem with BMP is, you could saturate the CX real quick if you print the same type of products, prolly except PE ?


[25-Jun-24 11:07 AM] jcheung#0000
good to know


[25-Jun-24 11:07 AM] jcheung#0000
was going to split it between consumables and building mats


[25-Jun-24 11:08 AM] jvaler#0000
this is mainly an issue if you go all-in on BMPs (20 fit in a 1 permit base)
if you mix in WPLs i wouldn't worry about it, cause WPLs take up so much area you'll have less BMPs


[25-Jun-24 11:15 AM] razenpok#0000
Aren't WPLs less area-to-profit efficient?


[25-Jun-24 11:17 AM] jvaler#0000
nope, cause their high profit per building makes up for the area use


[25-Jun-24 11:23 AM] jvaler#0000
9 WPL fit in 475 area, so multiply these by 9 and you get better profit and better ROI than 20 BMP

Welcome @spermatozoon_saloon to the Antares Development Initiative! To access the rest of the server, you will need to be manually assigned a role.

First, please tell us about where you're located in-game, what your goals are, and what you're looking for in ADI. Then, add your company ID to your discord nickname in the `[Username] | [CO ID]` format, that way you can be more easily looked up in-game. Once that is all sent, please ping @jvaler to help you get roled!

Currently, i am in Katoa, located at Benten, looking to relocate to Antares space if such ability would enable me to do so. My goal is to contribute to the community with sustainable production of fuel and other sundries, with other specializations to contribute upon request as well. I have been active in game for two months now, i like the game a lot, and i'd love to try to create for myself and others a awesome venture. oh, and i have an active pro license and have maintained it for the duration of playing this game so far.


[05-Jul-24 08:53 PM] puncher23#0000
Hello my name is Keenmind and I have a long term goal of setting up a multiplanet Manufac/mining smelting empire.  Currently I am on Deimos with plans to expand to Nike for the cogc of construction while using the cogc of Deimos for Aluminium refining.  I then plan to expand into a hauling service with at least 10 ships and am currently working with the largest hauling corp in game to provide services. THis money would be used to set up on Nike/Deimos and efficiently develop those planets to their full potential. @jvaler

Antares claims another victim

it's the sweet sweet smell of aluminum

Jokes aside we need people without a base on Nike yet if y'all are interested


[05-Jul-24 08:57 PM] helminsted#0000
my only question i suppose would be, may i have a small amount of guidance on how to uproot my operation in favor of taking on Nike?


[05-Jul-24 08:57 PM] helminsted#0000
such as what products to specialize for and the finer etc of what is to be expected out of me upon this venture?


[05-Jul-24 08:58 PM] tanda#0000
we're not really heavily into obligations, though we are in need of members for coop project bases


[05-Jul-24 08:59 PM] tanda#0000
Ideally you would decide if you plan on staying in that region of space, then arrange to either have parts shipped down to ANT space to setup down here or just use funds and our internal market to start up another base in this region


[05-Jul-24 08:59 PM] tanda#0000
and we are all VERY opinionated, so you will have lots of input


[05-Jul-24 09:00 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Jvaler usually does it but I roled you both. Check #kevin-information for info on the project


[05-Jul-24 09:00 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Probably a bit late to COLIQ but you could disassemble your base for fabs and ship it all down. We'd probably fund the costs


[05-Jul-24 09:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Though Katoa is full so you should keep the CM on there


[05-Jul-24 09:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You could also have one ship in Castillo and one in ANT but it sounds difficult to me


[05-Jul-24 09:03 PM] helminsted#0000
excellent! i am happy to be here =] toast to the fortune, a toast to the journey, and a few more toasts to get so drunk we forget where we put the corner stone and pick a random corner for the eventual tourists XD I am happy to start this as soon as possible


[05-Jul-24 09:05 PM] puncher23#0000
Well i want a base on nike for the lst for production of MSG and such so count me in for NIKE 100%


[05-Jul-24 09:06 PM] puncher23#0000
and of course the awesome cogc


[05-Jul-24 09:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
well...


[05-Jul-24 09:07 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We are planning full PP3 bases there to make INS


[05-Jul-24 09:10 PM] puncher23#0000
Ok so I prob need to ask how the Grant/loan/requirements are.  What is required what strings are or are not attached  what the base is supposed to do or up to user.  Got ahead of myself a bit I think.


[05-Jul-24 09:12 PM] tanda#0000
so there's a couple different sets of offerings. There's the basic ADI 750k grant. Only strings attached are you have to be a newer player and the grant needs to be spent on developments in Antares space


[05-Jul-24 09:13 PM] tanda#0000
#kevin-operations has its own set of a 25% grant and a 0% interest loan, but they are explicitly for setting up the bases needed to fill out the project (currently a BMP base making PE or a PP3 base making INS)

You will need to make a LOT of C


[06-Jul-24 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000

I'm located in Antares 2 - Deimos (ZV-759c). My goal for now is to become sufficient enough to be able to make a sustainable profit. I'm looking mostly for advice in ADI since I'm on a free account, not much can be done to help me to my understanding.


[08-Jul-24 11:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
This is correct


[08-Jul-24 11:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and happy to offer advice 🙂


[08-Jul-24 11:30 PM] riseoffilth#0000
1. Dont mix industries. Deimos COGC is metallurgy. Focus as much of your industry going metallurgy, like SMEs


[08-Jul-24 11:30 PM] riseoffilth#0000
buy your inputs, sell your outputs, and get more SMEs


[08-Jul-24 11:34 PM] x_draak_x#0000
Hey Rise! Its Fiery Ashes, btw. My ships are almost out of fuel, my funds are low, in a nutshell, I'm struggling haha. But I have everything but a carbon production to produce aluminum ingots. So those are gonna be what I'm going to be selling and I'm planning on buying fuel, building supplies, and carbon


[08-Jul-24 11:37 PM] x_draak_x#0000
Should I even attempt to get carbon production running? Or should I just buy it? It is fairly cheap


[08-Jul-24 11:37 PM] x_draak_x#0000
But the fuel costs are racking up


[08-Jul-24 11:39 PM] x_draak_x#0000
And my population satisfaction is bottoming out haha


[08-Jul-24 11:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
SME is what you want


[08-Jul-24 11:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
you NEED to maintain RATS/DW/OVE


[08-Jul-24 11:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
its a must


[08-Jul-24 11:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
COF/PWO if at all possible as well


[08-Jul-24 11:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I recommend, dont make your own carbon. Just focus on only producing AL


[08-Jul-24 11:49 PM] x_draak_x#0000
Okay, well, I need carbon to do that...


[08-Jul-24 11:54 PM] riseoffilth#0000
yep


[08-Jul-24 11:54 PM] riseoffilth#0000
go buy


[08-Jul-24 11:56 PM] x_draak_x#0000
I spent most of my money on consumables and fuel, price of carbon went up


[08-Jul-24 11:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
Try to fly your ships as full as you can and as slowly as you can to conserve fuel.


[08-Jul-24 11:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
(That advice might be a little late for you)


[08-Jul-24 11:59 PM] x_draak_x#0000
It is a bit late, but none-the-less useful!


[09-Jul-24 12:02 AM] x_draak_x#0000
How high would be acceptable above normal price would I be able to sell AL?


[09-Jul-24 12:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
You probably can't hold onto stock very long, you need the money for your consumables and expansion. I would say you can probably post it $1 less then the lowest offer (which is $839 right now). That will probably sell pretty quickly since AL moves fast. If you have a chance to sell above that, it's great.


[09-Jul-24 12:05 AM] archielvahr#0000
The request price is ~$800/u now which is pretty close.


[09-Jul-24 12:06 AM] x_draak_x#0000
Okay, still sounds like I can earn a pretty penny once it finishes its eternal refining

I don't know exactly... But I can't make trades of materials with other players without paying for pro, which I haven't done


[09-Jul-24 01:55 AM] jcheung#0000
Just figure that out and give me the numbers


[09-Jul-24 01:56 AM] x_draak_x#0000
How do I figure that out?


[09-Jul-24 01:56 AM] x_draak_x#0000
Oh


[09-Jul-24 01:56 AM] x_draak_x#0000
Okay


[09-Jul-24 01:58 AM] x_draak_x#0000
RAT=76, DW=76, OVE=10


[09-Jul-24 02:02 AM] jcheung#0000
And COF, PWO?


[09-Jul-24 02:03 AM] jcheung#0000
I suppose i should give context for why I'm asking.
We're going to launder some money


[09-Jul-24 02:03 AM] jcheung#0000
I'm not rich by any means but i can get you a little bit


[09-Jul-24 02:03 AM] x_draak_x#0000
How?


[09-Jul-24 02:04 AM] x_draak_x#0000
COF=10, PWO=4


[09-Jul-24 02:05 AM] jcheung#0000
for starters you're going to take down all the buy orders you have up currently


[09-Jul-24 02:05 AM] jcheung#0000
then under textiles, 'NL' place a buy order for as many as you can afford at the lowest price it'll let you


[09-Jul-24 02:08 AM] x_draak_x#0000
I need 24,190 for 10 days of supplies


[09-Jul-24 02:09 AM] jcheung#0000
that's not the lowest price you can put


[09-Jul-24 02:09 AM] jcheung#0000
do like 3851 or something


[09-Jul-24 02:10 AM] jcheung#0000
hmm. looks like it rounded


[09-Jul-24 02:10 AM] x_draak_x#0000
Ok


[09-Jul-24 02:10 AM] jcheung#0000
uh, 3900?


[09-Jul-24 02:11 AM] jcheung#0000
now list those at 4450


[09-Jul-24 02:12 AM] jcheung#0000
repeat again


[09-Jul-24 02:12 AM] jcheung#0000
(yes there's probably better stuff to do this with but i'm too lazy to find it right now)


[09-Jul-24 02:12 AM] x_draak_x#0000

[09-Jul-24 02:15 AM] x_draak_x#0000
Okay, thank you!


[09-Jul-24 02:15 AM] jcheung#0000
now list a buy order for the stuff you need at the lowest price it'll let you while having you be first

what happened?


[09-Jul-24 02:18 AM] x_draak_x#0000
I'm looking at the order book and priced too high


[09-Jul-24 02:18 AM] jcheung#0000
for which good, at what price


[09-Jul-24 02:18 AM] x_draak_x#0000

[09-Jul-24 02:20 AM] jcheung#0000

if you listed your DW at 80 it'll start buying instantly from anything underneath it

[09-Jul-24 12:10 PM] jvaler#0000
click on "SDBR" at the top left, then click on your company name in the top right. the code should be in the buffer that opens


[10-Jul-24 12:19 PM] x_draak_x#0000
@jcheung Thanks for all the help! I've got a solid start now thanks to you!

No.

1 x 750k AIC.


[10-Jul-24 01:19 PM] x_draak_x#0000
Okay, and do I have to have pro for that?


[10-Jul-24 01:28 PM] jcheung#0000
To get contracts from other players, yes. But if you can convince people otherwise i could funnel you the funds through the cx again, just.... probably going to take a lot longer 😂


[10-Jul-24 01:29 PM] tanda#0000
I do also have some Pro codes that could be used. Several of us do


[10-Jul-24 01:35 PM] jcheung#0000
That would simplify things


[10-Jul-24 02:19 PM] x_draak_x#0000
That truly would, and next time I get money I could send you a $10 steam gift card in return


[10-Jul-24 02:49 PM] jcheung#0000
Would be better to spend that on pro yourself 😄
Gifted time doesn't give you basic after - sets you back to free


[10-Jul-24 02:50 PM] realharvey#0000
you cant use the pro vouchers yourself

I won't have the money till next month


[10-Jul-24 07:37 PM] x_draak_x#0000
@tanda if you're okay with me repaying you next month, would you be willing to send me one of the codes?


[10-Jul-24 07:37 PM] tanda#0000
no repayment necessary!


[10-Jul-24 07:38 PM] evany.#0000
true but you can swap them with other people who have it


[10-Jul-24 07:38 PM] tanda#0000
like seriously, if you enjoy the game, spend that on your own paid Pro month to have forever Basic


[10-Jul-24 07:38 PM] evany.#0000
i bought 3 months and gave my other 3 months to someone who did the same giving us six months


[10-Jul-24 07:38 PM] x_draak_x#0000

[10-Jul-24 08:38 PM] tanda#0000
I can't say it's not really worth it, I now have nearly 2 years of PRO, nearly a year of game time codes to give away, I got to name a system, I can name a planet when I want to, and apparently there's physical merch?


[10-Jul-24 08:39 PM] x_draak_x#0000
huh, okay, sounds pretty cool


[10-Jul-24 08:56 PM] evany.#0000
thats how i do eve someone asked me about it the other day because the monthly sub is like 20$/mo which is ridiculous for a game thats so much about multiboxing


[10-Jul-24 08:57 PM] evany.#0000
you need to spend like 400$ to get down into like 6$/mo subscription category while working through sales and stuff until it becomes reasonably priced


[10-Jul-24 08:57 PM] evany.#0000
so if your commited to it and intend to play that long.. #worth


[10-Jul-24 09:05 PM] tanda#0000
the monthly sub is $20?


[10-Jul-24 09:07 PM] tanda#0000

Currently located on Harmonia. Joined cause a friend of mine took an interest in the game so I've been poking about with different stuff. I like exploration and settling new places in games, seems like something to be done with this game! 

Not super sure what this is, but I'm in the Antares area and thought why not 😂

right on well you found a place!

theres a bunch of us talking about se-110


[10-Jul-24 11:40 PM] evany.#0000
that said it depends on what your expectation is of 'exploration' - its not like say a stellaris or even starsector


[10-Jul-24 11:40 PM] wolfking6116#0000
Ah yeah I looked out that way, but have seen exceedingly few fertile planets (even at a negative) 😅 😂


[10-Jul-24 11:40 PM] evany.#0000
the galaxy at this point is largely discovered


[10-Jul-24 11:41 PM] evany.#0000
habitable on the other hand-- entirely different question.


[10-Jul-24 11:41 PM] wolfking6116#0000
Yeah I've sort of figured there's not really any deeper into space to explore. My hope was that there's some way to discover new resources on some planets, because a vast many of them seem so... barren


[10-Jul-24 11:41 PM] evany.#0000
to my knowledge thats currently a big ten nope


[10-Jul-24 11:42 PM] jvaler#0000
if you're looking for fertile planets i'd look at demeter, it's the go-to planet to get more FRMs in antares space


[10-Jul-24 11:42 PM] evany.#0000
there has been talks of 'terraforming' for literally years


[10-Jul-24 11:43 PM] wolfking6116#0000
The only "eden" I've stumbled upon is Pyrgos, which is vast worlds away, but even like... its neighbors are more resource rich than practically anything nearby Harmonia 😅

Hi, I started on Phobos and moved headquarters to Hephaestus later on.  My goals so fare are to be selfsufficient and mostly independend. It turned out that I became a major food producer. I'm currently working on reaching level 24 to make further expansions possible. In order to bring more excitement back into it, I would like to perhaps produce complex high-tech components together with others. Or set out and mine rare resources for cool other products. Whatever.

[13-Jul-24 11:52 AM] coolair2691#0000
Maybe youre not aware of it, you can use 3 base permits per planet to gain more production capacity


[13-Jul-24 11:56 AM] tanda#0000
oh boy


[13-Jul-24 11:58 AM] evany.#0000
Yeah but it’s typically recommended not to multi permit


[13-Jul-24 11:58 AM] coolair2691#0000
Why not?


[13-Jul-24 12:00 PM] akyantor#0000
I think if you’re trying to min/max you get more area if you only ever have 1 permit bases. As the first permit grants 500 area, with permits 2 and 3 only giving you an additional 250.


[13-Jul-24 12:00 PM] evany.#0000
because its only half the efficiency as akyan explained


[13-Jul-24 12:02 PM] evany.#0000
your better off spreading those productions out to 3 different bases because they would give you 1500 land rather than 1000


[13-Jul-24 12:02 PM] akyantor#0000
That said… definitely situations where you might do it while still expanding


[13-Jul-24 12:02 PM] evany.#0000
argument to be made for temporarily doing it as well if your early on you might have 'extra' permits


[13-Jul-24 12:03 PM] akyantor#0000
It’s probably a lot more relevant trying to min/max when buying more permits becomes prohibitively expensive.


[13-Jul-24 12:03 PM] evany.#0000
thats why when you see older players that have 15+ bases
they would rather pay you to use your permit instead


[13-Jul-24 12:03 PM] evany.#0000
their permits are too valuable to throw away on multipermiting a base


[13-Jul-24 12:04 PM] evany.#0000
i'm not even an old player and i have already started to do that.


[13-Jul-24 12:07 PM] evany.#0000
not trying to tell you how to play, and i think theres arguments to be made if your newer and have extra permits and cheap hq's

but i'd say know two things before you do it
1.) its not optimal
2.) you will throw those buildings away at some point and demolish them so consider the materials forfeit


[13-Jul-24 12:08 PM] evany.#0000
if you accept those two things and maybe dont have the spare ships/cycles to add more planets- its probably worth it knowing full well it will be short term

Best HQ location! 🙌

I think another argument fot multi permit bases is it simplifies logistics. Fewer places to travel to


[13-Jul-24 03:43 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, definitely a place for it.


[13-Jul-24 11:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
We are all aware of it.


[13-Jul-24 11:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
You just want to avoid falling into the multiple permit trap early on.


[13-Jul-24 11:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
There's reasons and situations that call for 2/3 permits, or if you are trying to reduce your required management etc. but really there's no need to plan yourself into 3 permits, especially at the start.


[13-Jul-24 11:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Especially as permits become the biggest cost quite quickly, by the time you reach that point in your HQ level you'll be paying a very very large sum for very little return.


[13-Jul-24 11:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Plus, from base area  perspective, 500 for a new base but only 250 extra for an additional permit. You are sacrificing 250 area when you could be using it to produce another commodity which gives you better chances of avoiding funny market shenanigans.


[13-Jul-24 11:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Typically people think to build their 2nd base directly supporting or playing off from their first base, whether that be smelting into construction or farming into food processing.


[14-Jul-24 03:10 AM] coolair2691#0000
Its a way of thiniking. Distribute in deversity or maximize performance through consolidation. Have in mind, logistic will become an important factor later on. Nevertheless, either way is a good way as long as you become wealthy.

By the way, what Greater Antares Sector project are currently running? This is what I might be interested in.


[14-Jul-24 06:03 AM] akyantor#0000
I don't think the Greater Antares Section project is still going at this point, but there are some other initiatives:
- Plastic Producing Persons (PPP) - An effort to try to reduce the price of PG on the AI CX
- Kevin (don't ask) - An effort to try to reduce teh price of INS on the AI CX


[14-Jul-24 06:04 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm not directly involved in either, but multiple people in the server are helping out with these in various ways.  There may still be ways to help with them.


[14-Jul-24 06:06 AM] akyantor#0000

Depending on what you do, max permits or even double permits are going to strain your logistics more.


[14-Jul-24 11:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
And keep in mind, different commodities have different markets, you may not even be able to sell certain commodities at a 3 permit or even 2 permit rate.


[14-Jul-24 11:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Way of thinking sure, but I'd still hate to see you follow up with it and would really hope you'd reconsider your path into singular permits.

I am located on Harmonia in Antares space. 

I am a new player ( 3 weeks into the game ). I am a carbon farmer and a PE producer. 

I am looking for a community to partake in. I have previously Lands of Lords, which is a browser game relatively comparable. From there I know that one of the most engaging points about the game are not mechanics - but rather how different players interact in a group.

So far my goals are to expand my carbon production and move the PE production to a specialised planet. For the far future, I really like the idea of becoming a large copper/gold/PE supplier for electronics

welcome! #prun-tool-discussion might be of interest to you for that last bit. i think a few people have talked about making a shipping tool in the past, not sure tho


[24-Jul-24 01:49 AM] shinonomesciences#0000
Thanks, I'll definitely take a look


[24-Jul-24 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Definitely an influx of Phobos folk here recently.

In the options you get when you start it just makes sense. If you don't know anything about the game You see high population, water and moderate environment. I didn't know about COGCs when started T_T


[24-Jul-24 02:27 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's not a big deal at the beginning but definitely a major point for scaling production


[24-Jul-24 02:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
Phobos is definitely not the most ideal starter due to the COGC but it is not absolutely awful.


[24-Jul-24 02:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can do very well for yourself.


[24-Jul-24 02:36 AM] marat_sh#0000
Difference is minor for beginners. My set up is making 12k net profit on phobos. Same set up with hq bonus on Hephaestus would be 15k net profit + less time to travel to CX


[24-Jul-24 02:37 AM] marat_sh#0000
A day*


[24-Jul-24 09:03 AM] jcheung#0000
🤔 for a new player that's a pretty big difference


[24-Jul-24 09:03 AM] jcheung#0000
you effectively don't have HQ bonus btw


[24-Jul-24 09:39 AM] marat_sh#0000
Yes i know but when it takes so much time 5k difference isn’t a big deal when everything costs so much. Like I said It’s fine and not end of the world but not optimal for scaling


[24-Jul-24 09:47 AM] jcheung#0000
i mean. it's 25% of your income 😛


[24-Jul-24 09:55 AM] marat_sh#0000
If my income is $1 and you make it $2 I wouldn’t care if beer costs $100


[24-Jul-24 09:57 AM] marat_sh#0000
All I am saying there is no point of stressing out the bad start as long as your ROI less then 2 weeks. Mine is 8 days with that setup


[24-Jul-24 09:58 AM] marat_sh#0000
So what I do? I don’t expand it and collect money to place a new Core Module instead of starting over and loosing a week of playing

Hey everyone! If you're interested in working together in a co-op project, DNPC is looking for more members! 🙂

DNPC (Deimos-Nike production co-op) is a project in AA that's focused on making BBH/BSE, and we're in need of 2 more Nike bases. If you've got a permit free and you're interested, please send me a message 😄


[27-Jul-24 04:16 PM] flor2081#0000
We can provide 0% interest loans to pay off whenever you want, as well as help with all the shipping!


[28-Jul-24 02:39 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm currently Mining ALO on Nascent and shipping to Deimos. I have also set up STO on Vulcan for my overflow ALO. Maybe I should start smelting on Vulcan and drop a base on Nike also ? Gonna need more ships lol


[28-Jul-24 02:40 PM] flor2081#0000
the Nike base in this project wouldn't need much shipping, just for the building materials and your own consumables


[28-Jul-24 02:41 PM] flor2081#0000
the AL/LST will be delivered by the producers


[28-Jul-24 02:41 PM] flor2081#0000
so you can easily provide your base for consumables for months and not do any shipping 🙂


[28-Jul-24 02:41 PM] igfloz#0000
LM transfers I presume ?


[28-Jul-24 02:43 PM] flor2081#0000
we just do it via direct contracts, thats a bit easier


[28-Jul-24 02:43 PM] igfloz#0000
rgr, I'll take a look in prun planner


[28-Jul-24 02:44 PM] igfloz#0000
I presume I aim to fill 500 tile space ?


[28-Jul-24 02:45 PM] flor2081#0000

the project works like this: the people on Deimos send the AL/O to Nike, which you request there. At the end of the week you send me your produced materials and we split it evenly according to repair costs, consumable costs etc


[28-Jul-24 02:54 PM] flor2081#0000
you're supposed to provide your own building materials and consumables, but we can easily provide you with long-term loans for those 😄


[28-Jul-24 02:56 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm in (tentatively) - Let me look at my funds and what this would cost me. I'll get back to you soon if I'm gonna need a loan. Also gonna look at my flight plans and see if I can fit this in relatively quickly. I'm sure  I can call on shipping help if needed 😄


[28-Jul-24 02:59 PM] flor2081#0000

1. Anrates 2 - Deimos
2. Open new production lines (probably carbon)
3. Some guidance on finances, financial help if i get PRO in the future
@jvaler


[29-Jul-24 04:15 AM] jcheung#0000
what kind of financial guidance?


[29-Jul-24 04:15 AM] perac1#0000
What to spend money on, e.t.c.


[29-Jul-24 04:25 AM] jcheung#0000
what do you have now on deimos and what are your plans for deimos currently?
what does your plan look like for carbon, or is that not yet developed?


[29-Jul-24 04:29 AM] finestone#0000
well the easist way is buy con mats and fill our your base


[29-Jul-24 04:30 AM] perac1#0000
I have 2 habitats, extractor and 2 smelters, both making Al. As for plans - either build another habitat, incinerator and farmstead to produce C, but it may be inefficient, or expand to settlers and build Glass furnace/metallist studio.


[29-Jul-24 04:30 AM] perac1#0000
Or to make an extractor on another planet and bring materials to Deimos


[29-Jul-24 04:33 AM] finestone#0000

14-18 ROI (with experts)(AVG-SELL) so yeah would work 😄


[29-Jul-24 04:41 AM] finestone#0000
Hope thats helps good luck!


[29-Jul-24 04:41 AM] perac1#0000
And can you explain what ROI means?


[29-Jul-24 04:42 AM] finestone#0000
Return on Investment aka how long will it take for the building to pay for itself


[29-Jul-24 04:42 AM] perac1#0000
Ah, okay


[29-Jul-24 04:42 AM] perac1#0000
THanks


[29-Jul-24 04:45 AM] finestone#0000
The AL makes more money because its on a metallurgy planet so the Carbon/Farming isn't necessary but it would certainly work


[29-Jul-24 04:46 AM] finestone#0000
and in terms of inputs your just trading Carbon for H20


[29-Jul-24 04:47 AM] finestone#0000
And you *Shouldn't* Rig your own water as it makes such little money buying makes more sense


[29-Jul-24 04:54 AM] perac1#0000
So, do you have any other questions?


[29-Jul-24 04:55 AM] perac1#0000
As i can see, carbon production makes revenue bigger


[29-Jul-24 04:55 AM] perac1#0000
So, I could do it probably


[29-Jul-24 04:58 AM] perac1#0000
But I don't have money for it(


[29-Jul-24 04:59 AM] finestone#0000
As far as i can tell these would be roughly the profit per day AL (2-4k) ALO (3k) C (2k) Farm (2k)


[29-Jul-24 05:00 AM] perac1#0000
I don't have that much of every building


[29-Jul-24 05:00 AM] perac1#0000
Only 2 BH1, 1 EXT, 2 SME


[29-Jul-24 05:00 AM] finestone#0000
that is the game expanding!


[29-Jul-24 05:01 AM] perac1#0000
Yes it is


[29-Jul-24 05:01 AM] perac1#0000
But money + materials are problem


[29-Jul-24 05:01 AM] perac1#0000
Tomorrow I'll have only 65k +-


[29-Jul-24 05:02 AM] perac1#0000
Maybe thats enough for extractor+BH1


[29-Jul-24 05:02 AM] finestone#0000
True takes time to make money you can also apply for a grant if you have Pro


[29-Jul-24 05:03 AM] perac1#0000
I don't, unfortunately


[29-Jul-24 05:03 AM] perac1#0000
So, it'll be slow

[30-Jul-24 09:34 AM] riseoffilth#0000
just a note, if you continue to be serious about manfacturing, a tip.

This game heavily leans into maximizing your production bonuses. There is something called a COGC. Chamber of galatic commerce. It is voted on every week in the planet window, see "PLI [planet code]", so "PLI ZV-307D". At the bottom is a button for COGC. Depending on what people vote for, it gives a 25% production/speed bonus to a single type of industry. Phobos is Electronics. If you are doing BMPs, you are a manufacturer. There is another planet in system called Hephaestus that is COGC bonused to Manufacturing, and will help you make more money by allowing your production to be faster.

ah of course 😄 didn't see that you can start as an electronics manufacturer?

What is The FIO APY KEY?


[31-Jul-24 02:00 AM] barskipatzow#0000
@riseoffilth not sure if I'll stay a manufacturer, it depends on how profitable it generally is. It sounds the most interesting of the bunch, since you have to manage logistics and stuff.


[31-Jul-24 02:01 AM] riseoffilth#0000
You cannot, as all the electronic buildings are… advanced? Shall we say


[31-Jul-24 02:01 AM] barskipatzow#0000
so manufacturer makes sense as a start for electronics anyway?


[31-Jul-24 02:01 AM] riseoffilth#0000
I started on Phobos as manufacturing and never regretted it (at least once I got off of Phobos)


[31-Jul-24 02:01 AM] riseoffilth#0000
I love manufacturing


[31-Jul-24 02:01 AM] riseoffilth#0000

[31-Jul-24 09:22 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yep - most people COLIQ at least once, especially since the starter information isn’t super helpful. And the starting profession just changes what materials you begin with, nothings stopping you from changing industries at any point 🙂


[31-Jul-24 09:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
I started on Harmonia and found that to be pretty straightforward - you’d be farming and either creating carbon in an incinerator or making rations in food processors. Neither is amazingly profitable, but they’re consistent. Others here have more experience in manufacturing if you wanna stay with that and they’re happy to help you


[31-Jul-24 09:28 AM] sidepipe#0000
If you wanna stick with manufacturing, I’d do what Rise recommended and relocate to Hephaestus. It will cost some money, but that’s what the ADI grant is for (if you have pro 🙂 )


[31-Jul-24 10:42 AM] riseoffilth#0000
(that being said, if you have pro, ill literally give you the mats for the new base on heph. You can do anything with phobos, its just the COGC bonus makes all the difference)


[01-Aug-24 04:28 AM] barskipatzow#0000
Wow, thanks. on a side note, is there a Jita equivalent in the world? 🙂


[01-Aug-24 04:28 AM] barskipatzow#0000

Hey hey folks, not really a new player per-se, I played for a few weeks a few years ago, and started playing again a couple of months ago. As my company name suggests (`Carbon-Free Carbon`), I grow HCP on Harmonia, ship it to Nascent, where I produce the highly-in-demand Carbon. I currently produce about 7% of the Carbon sold on AI1 per day, but I am bottlenecked by how much I can ship. I am looking for strategic partners to whom I can supply my C and HCP, or who will help me ship my goods. I am also looking for a loan - my profits are steadily increasing, and my return on investment is super short.

Hello, pretty new player, I am located on Antares I - Phobos atm (with plans to expand to Eos), currently supplying mostly STL fuel (SF) (low amounts) and silicon ore (SIO) due to what my starter planet had. I plan to up my STL fuel production when I expand to Eos. I am currently working a little on at least producing some of the consumables I use but will have to keep buying overalls instead of producing them. I am not rushing into deeper aspects yet and am slowly turning a profit even if I am kind of low on cash at all times (due to trying to push expansion of production). While I understand I likely should have just restarted I am fine being slow and taking my time since I am still growing slowly

If it's the wrong place, then you may get space'd. Don't worry though, you won't notice if it happens, really.

Current account is about 150 days old. Just making RATs on Promitor like a good newbie starts off doing (Based on the YT videos I watched). Looking to expand into more that just farming beans. Open to suggestions.


[04-Aug-24 05:07 PM] tanda#0000
oh boy do we have some


[04-Aug-24 05:07 PM] tanda#0000
welcome to ADI!


[04-Aug-24 05:07 PM] jvaler#0000
welcome, roled!

150d is quite a while to still be on a single base. what's your current building setup like?


[04-Aug-24 05:10 PM] jackals_89#0000
3 Farmstead, 2 Food Processor, 2 Rigs


[04-Aug-24 05:10 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm yeah that's quite small


[04-Aug-24 05:11 PM] jvaler#0000
sounds like it should be decent profits though?


[04-Aug-24 05:12 PM] jackals_89#0000
I mean 200k every two weeks which is pretty small. For the most part I get on every day and update my production lines


[04-Aug-24 05:13 PM] jackals_89#0000
Have about 600k ICA. But dont really know where to expand from there


[04-Aug-24 05:13 PM] jackals_89#0000
Worried about making a mistake and wasting time.


[04-Aug-24 05:13 PM] evany.#0000
it depends on your goals friend


[04-Aug-24 05:13 PM] evany.#0000
theres almost always someone that will be able to point out a more money/hr


[04-Aug-24 05:14 PM] evany.#0000
but i'd encourage you to finish out that area on your main before doing a second base


[04-Aug-24 05:14 PM] evany.#0000
it keeps logistics simple and economically scales your income.


[04-Aug-24 05:14 PM] evany.#0000
i'm guessing while your relatively old you haven't gotten involved in other groups socially much otherwise you probably would have bit on a project already


[04-Aug-24 05:14 PM] evany.#0000
we have a few in under the cult header that are still looking for people


[04-Aug-24 05:14 PM] jackals_89#0000
yea just trying to figure it out


[04-Aug-24 05:15 PM] jvaler#0000
oh damn. well for a frame of reference, the most common progression path for promitor farmers is to max out your farms on promitor (13 FRMs fit in 475 area) and then expand into a base on avalon to do FP on

this lets you get the most out of the CoGC bonus each planet has


[04-Aug-24 05:15 PM] evany.#0000
lots of help is available in #associate-planning


[04-Aug-24 05:15 PM] evany.#0000
i'd encourage you to get familiar with prunplanner a bit.


[04-Aug-24 05:16 PM] jackals_89#0000
ok. I have a ship full with RAT headed to the market. I will plan it out on prunplanner to get upto 13 FRM with FP and Rigs


[04-Aug-24 05:17 PM] evany.#0000
welcome


[04-Aug-24 05:18 PM] jackals_89#0000
I will check out the associate planning room.


[04-Aug-24 05:19 PM] jackals_89#0000
Just want to be a bigger production chain. and learn as much as I can.


[04-Aug-24 05:23 PM] evany.#0000
you have a few options really, i started probably around same time as you 
i have 6 bases now i think and none of them are connected for the most part (CX -> inputs -> output -> CX) 
on the flipside some people tend to build a house of cards with one base feeding another base ( extract -> intermediate -> finish product -> CX)
and other people try to internalize (build bases that support each other, i.e 13 FRM then a production planet that creates rat,dw,ove,exo )

most typically encourage you not to go route #3 and i very much went route #1, but ultimately its your decision where your endgame is!


[04-Aug-24 05:33 PM] jackals_89#0000
ok thanks for the advice.

Hi. I've been playing Prosperous for a few months now as Metallurgist over on Moria Vallis, but am considering resetting and taking up a different profession. I felt like metallurgy was somewhat stale and consisted of me logging on every couple of days to set production going - sending my Iron to the local CX and buying a week or two supplies.

I'm looking to see what Antares needs and begin ramping up in a new profession (at a new location, if required). Please let me know what you guys would like me to focus on and what being part of the project entails. Thanks!

[06-Aug-24 11:55 AM] jcheung#0000
is there a particular field you're interested in?


[06-Aug-24 11:55 AM] imjoshuarice#0000
Anything that isn't as linear as "me mine iron, me smelt iron" I suppose 😄
I always envisaged having to manage and keep on top of specific production/buying in materials. In metallurgy with just Iron I was more or less just buying carbon and flux, then selling my rion.


[06-Aug-24 11:56 AM] jcheung#0000

Or COLIQ and setup shop on a planet that's full and one you won't be able to inhabit after you started


[08-Aug-24 11:30 AM] tanda#0000
even if you want to do nothing but farm, I'd still recommend getting onto Deimos


[08-Aug-24 11:30 AM] tanda#0000
if nothing else it is still fertile


[08-Aug-24 11:34 AM] tanda#0000
It's not the best advice, but if you're just interested in farming, these are your nonHYF options in the area

[08-Aug-24 11:34 AM] vincent.w7274#0000
i want to do other things then farm i just picked  farming as it was noob friendly now i know how things work abit  better was looking to try something elce and be in a group


[08-Aug-24 11:34 AM] tanda#0000
alright, then I definitely recommend getting a Deimos base


[08-Aug-24 11:34 AM] tanda#0000
especially if you think metallurgy is something you might want to get into a bit later


[08-Aug-24 11:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
Oh man, farming on Phobos feels kinda cursed but now I want to do it 😄


[08-Aug-24 11:36 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I wouldn't recommend Deimos without the grant. Metallurgy is not very profitable except once in a lifetime. However, with the grant you won't be enduring the early game slog so might as well take a planet only available at the start


[08-Aug-24 11:37 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
After the first planet you can do whatever industry you want


[08-Aug-24 11:37 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well, I suppose you can farm on Deimos as well


[08-Aug-24 11:39 AM] vincent.w7274#0000
i think might stay were i am for a cupple weeks and build up some cash and branch out to a new industry


[08-Aug-24 11:40 AM] tanda#0000
I definitely considered doing Phobos farming a while back


[08-Aug-24 11:46 AM] jcheung#0000

[08-Aug-24 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
i wonder why it's electronic and not agri, personally


[08-Aug-24 11:47 AM] vincent.w7274#0000

I'm located in Hortus - Promitor (VH-331a), which is the Faction seat of the ICA. My goal is to make as many edibles as possible, for all types of consumers.

For ADI I'm looking for a group to grow with and learn the game with and help in taking over the edible industry

Hi, I've been interested in buying a license as this game looked pretty interesting, coming from a few games of similar complexity.
My goals are to create a network of my own infrastructure to slowly build up a reputation, finishing my first base smelting aluminum.
I'm looking for any assistance I can get as I'm fairly fresh to all of this, learning the UI and what everything means will take a bit of time I'd imagine haha.

and like DvorakDward mentioned, if you're interested in projects, we do  have  open spots in #kevin-information, which is focusing on producing INS to lower prices in the antares market (since INS is necessary for colonizing many planets)


[14-Aug-24 10:08 PM] harucyber#0000

Looks pretty good for one week 🙂


[14-Aug-24 10:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
Though you may want to be careful about making too much PPA - it’s pretty thinly traded at the CX, so it may be hard to sell it all


[14-Aug-24 10:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
And as you make more money, you might want to consider buying water off the CX instead of extracting it on Harmonia to free up more space for farms. In general, it’s a good idea to eventually specialize your bases to take advantage of the COGC bonus. But that’s something you can do as you make the money to do it

[15-Aug-24 07:46 AM] harucyber#0000
I do mostly import my water, but I still find myself with shortages, which is why I have 2 rigs running


[15-Aug-24 07:47 AM] harucyber#0000
I spent at least 15,000AIC on H2O, so its not very good for my finances


[15-Aug-24 08:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, it is tough balancing everything early on. It helps to not stock up too much and make semi-frequent trips to the CX, but also fly as slow as possible to save fuel


[15-Aug-24 08:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
Have you made a lot of PPA so far?


[16-Aug-24 06:23 AM] flor2081#0000
Hey! Anyone interested in making agri products for me? All you need to do is put in the permit and I'll provide all the building materials, consumables, inputs and repairs (so you dont need to do any shipping at all)
The second you start you're getting paid 50k/day and you get priority on buying rations at 60/u 🙂


[16-Aug-24 06:27 AM] flor2081#0000
okay i might have to rethink that price as the CX is more than double that now 😂


[16-Aug-24 12:53 PM] harucyber#0000
only around 50, sold 20 already waiting on 30z


[16-Aug-24 12:53 PM] harucyber#0000
I’m just only producing rations atm

{Reactions}
👍 

[16-Aug-24 12:54 PM] harucyber#0000
what is the cons for stocking up? because fuel is expensive even though I’m flying at the minimum speed.


[16-Aug-24 12:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just the fact that money tied up in inventory is money you can’t use if you need it. But it seems like what you’re doing is working so far, so I wouldn’t worry about it too much 🙂


[16-Aug-24 03:18 PM] harucyber#0000
yeah so I have a ship running once a week to sell my stuff which is like 30k AIC worth of resources, keeping stuff that I horde from random contracts or wtv, and I have a ship that runs biweekly that picks up water and other consumables and construction mats ig. Works for me but won’t work once I scale to multiple bases because not enough ships lol


[16-Aug-24 03:29 PM] igfloz#0000
It is doable, I have 6 bases and only 2 ships (ok , granted I do have 1 WCB ship) - but you can schedule trips on a planned route. For example, planet A could feed into planet B, planet B could feed into planet C etc. Look at the internal market for supplies to get you going, lower supplies costs (burn items - OVE, RAT, DW etc.) can offset the fuel cost somewhat

you're still on a free license right?


[19-Aug-24 03:18 PM] razenpok#0000
You can go for a PRO license to get a grant here, to speed up the game a bit

Welcome @wooden_turtle to the Antares Development Initiative! To access the rest of the server, you will need to be manually assigned a role.

First, please tell us about where you're located in-game, what your goals are, and what you're looking for in ADI. Then, add your company ID to your discord nickname in the `[Username] | [CO ID]` format, that way you can be more easily looked up in-game. Once that is all sent, please ping @jvaler to help you get roled! (If jvaler is offline any Admin or Coordinator role can also assist you)


[20-Aug-24 11:43 AM] wooden_turtle#0000
Hi there! I'm fairly new to the game (tried and failed once or twice before and only just started a new company 🙂). I'm not currently based in Antares but I'd be happy to start a second base there. I'm located in Castilo-Ito (Katoa), and I started with the Fuel Engineer package.
My main goal for the second base would be to find a planet with good H availability, as it's the most important material for me that I can't currently produce (likely ZV-759g, Romulus, or IY-816h, unless I'm missing something). Hopefully, operating in both CI and Antares space would let me sell SF in Antares at affordable prices while also running deliveries between the two in the meantime.
And, generally, I'm looking to get more involved with the community and make all the waiting less boring 🙂

[20-Aug-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
not that i don't want you to join us in ANT, but why not CB-282d? it's fairly well developed, fourth best H source within 10 jumps of katoa


[20-Aug-24 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
only single red, and resource extraction COGC


[20-Aug-24 11:49 AM] jcheung#0000
it's the best within 5 jumps


[20-Aug-24 11:51 AM] jcheung#0000
to clarify, best H sources 1-3 are totally undeveloped

[20-Aug-24 11:52 AM] wooden_turtle#0000
tbh it's mostly that I haven't been able to find CI communities/servers that would be as active as this one is 😁 I'm early enough in the game that I know I'll be making suboptimal solutions anyway, and limiting my choice of a second base to Antares seems like a good enough tradeoff to get involved


[20-Aug-24 11:53 AM] jcheung#0000
🤔 what do you have planned for your third base?


[20-Aug-24 11:53 AM] wooden_turtle#0000
thanks a lot for the info though! I've been using https://universemap.duckdns.org/ but you sort of know what you need to be looking for to use it it seems

take anything prunplanner says with a grain of sand and verify yourself, but it's generally fairly accurate


[20-Aug-24 11:54 AM] jcheung#0000
the gov update broke a few things and while i'm sure most of it has recovered, some may not have


[20-Aug-24 11:56 AM] wooden_turtle#0000
nothing yet 🤷 not sure if I should look into HE3/TS for producing FF, or to go into manufacturing to make my own consumables (is that something most people do?)


[20-Aug-24 11:58 AM] jcheung#0000
anyhow. looking at these locations specifically
romulus is 12 jumps, but decently built up and not bad yield. pop looks like it could take on an EXT base without blinking
816h is great-if you can afford the planetary upkeep. i'm not sure this is a good idea if this will be your second base.
759g has 1/3 less yield than romulus but on the other hand is 4 jumps closer


[20-Aug-24 11:59 AM] jcheung#0000
generally speaking buying your consumables is better, unless you plan on making enough to sell to market


[20-Aug-24 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
that said there's a couple multi-member programs that make certain consumables


[20-Aug-24 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
i don't know if they currently have openings though, but i could check


[20-Aug-24 12:01 PM] jcheung#0000
basically you need pro, build a base and supply with workforce consumables, get free input, give the output away for free, every so often you get a portion of the combined project output


[20-Aug-24 12:01 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
by the way, how exactly does yield affect production? is it just a linear relationship of "the higher the yield, the less production time"?


[20-Aug-24 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
eh.... i'm not 100% sure, but higher yield numbers affect what you produce daily


[20-Aug-24 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
higher output means wf consumable costs are spread across more output units


[20-Aug-24 12:03 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
so... space communism? :D


[20-Aug-24 12:03 PM] jcheung#0000
eh


[20-Aug-24 12:03 PM] jcheung#0000
with less corruption, sure


[20-Aug-24 12:04 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
makes sense


[20-Aug-24 12:04 PM] jcheung#0000
actually let me plan out the bases, this will give easier to understand info

[20-Aug-24 12:07 PM] jcheung#0000
so this is with 5 experts, so a month or three of operation


[20-Aug-24 12:07 PM] jcheung#0000
but as you can see, you would make around 300 less H per day with the same inputs


[20-Aug-24 12:08 PM] jcheung#0000
hmm. AMM isn't terrible at romulus either so you could also mix in AMM production


[20-Aug-24 12:08 PM] jcheung#0000
which i think you need for some fuel recipes


[20-Aug-24 12:09 PM] jcheung#0000
ehm. all SF recipes*


[20-Aug-24 12:11 PM] jcheung#0000
AMM also has the.... dubious benefit of needing more weight capacity than H, so it would fill out a VCB more evenly


[20-Aug-24 12:13 PM] jcheung#0000
also if i'm talking too much tell me to shut up


[20-Aug-24 12:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Nah, keep talking. 🙂


[20-Aug-24 12:15 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
yeah, I do have some AMM on Katoa even if it's inefficient, so that's less of a priority than H for now


[20-Aug-24 12:16 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
you're good, this is very helpful!! I'm not sure if I can put everything you listed to good use given I just started yesterday and I'm barely keeping up with the concepts, but on the other hand that makes the info even more helpful xD


[20-Aug-24 12:18 PM] jcheung#0000
learning how prunplanner works will greatly help


[20-Aug-24 12:18 PM] jcheung#0000
anyways


[20-Aug-24 12:19 PM] jcheung#0000
my concern is going to be your ability to ship H from ANT space up to you


[20-Aug-24 12:19 PM] jcheung#0000
....could i convince you to instead come down here with the fuel refining portion? 😄


[20-Aug-24 12:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@wooden_turtle you watched the PRUN tutorial videos, haven't you?


[20-Aug-24 12:21 PM] jcheung#0000
as a side note, katoa is a mfg COGC which isn't ideal for fuel production


[20-Aug-24 12:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@jcheung look at my in-game age... That's how old those videos are.


[20-Aug-24 12:22 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

**shoves his face with BBQ'ed pork loin** this stuff is so good!


[20-Aug-24 12:24 PM] jcheung#0000
anyways, like i was saying, katoa isn't ideal for fuel refining, could probably find you a place with fuel refining COGC to refine SF closer to the H source. I produce some GAL for someone else but i'm sure i could convince them into letting me have some of the output


[20-Aug-24 12:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
That sort of idea, is good for a mid-game PRO player... Not so much good for a newbro. I've seen HQ level players, through like 13, just get completely choked out, from not being able to get enough logistical capacity to keep their SF/FF bases running properly.

A re-hashing of ideas, could be needed.


[20-Aug-24 12:28 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm trying to reduce their logistical tail


[20-Aug-24 12:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Same.


[20-Aug-24 12:28 PM] jcheung#0000
they want to haul H from ANT to BEN


[20-Aug-24 12:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If they're Pro | Basic, they can off-load the logistics to third parties, via CX LM shipping conts (third party)... They're new though? I'd say give them a week, at least, to process everything.


[20-Aug-24 12:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Prun's learning curve, is harder than Eve Online's industry career path... It's rough AF.


[20-Aug-24 12:30 PM] jcheung#0000
i would assume free license for now


[20-Aug-24 12:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah. Lol, would they like the slow tempo? Would they life the AFK nature of the game? Would they like the social aspect of the game + long-term planning?


[20-Aug-24 12:34 PM] jcheung#0000
they're trying to join ANT because they want to interact with people so....


[20-Aug-24 12:34 PM] jcheung#0000

I read the handbook (not really a video person)


[20-Aug-24 12:40 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
currently free license, I'm not opposed to getting pro if I really have to, but I want to make sure I'm sticking with the game first


[20-Aug-24 12:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Hnmm.


[20-Aug-24 12:41 PM] jcheung#0000
grant will probably require pro btw


[20-Aug-24 12:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Basic, at least.


[20-Aug-24 12:41 PM] jcheung#0000
basic requires pro 😛


[20-Aug-24 12:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
1 month pro + depreciation into basic.


[20-Aug-24 12:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, but it's a limited thing.


[20-Aug-24 12:42 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
and I can't say for sure just how slow I'd be comfortable with yet, but I'm pretty sure that having some common goals with people will be more of a pro for me than longer wait times will be a con if that makes sense


[20-Aug-24 12:42 PM] igfloz#0000
I have some keys for new players if required - it's a bit hit and miss if they work I find


[20-Aug-24 12:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ Give them a week.


[20-Aug-24 12:43 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
yeah I realized that once I started figuring out prunplanner. it's literally recommended in the handbook as the starting base for fuel refining though 🙃


[20-Aug-24 12:43 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
(which is why I chose it, I mean)


[20-Aug-24 12:43 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, that... may have been true years ago?


[20-Aug-24 12:43 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@wooden_turtle will have to import H from Benten CX, for now. They can extract their own AMM and GAL, then run their refinery process.


[20-Aug-24 12:44 PM] wooden_turtle#0000
yes, that's what I'm setting up now 👍


[20-Aug-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000
actually maybe it's recommended because it has 2 of the 3 things you need to make SF


[20-Aug-24 12:45 PM] jcheung#0000
and their yields, while not great, are not the worst


[20-Aug-24 12:46 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's something, at least. H isn't that expensive anyways... IF they go pro, we can help them out, along the way. IF they go limited pro, then invert to basic, we can show them how they can help themselves.


[20-Aug-24 12:46 PM] jcheung#0000

Welcome @crustysock to the Antares Development Initiative! To access the rest of the server, you will need to be manually assigned a role.

First, please tell us about where you're located in-game, what your goals are, and what you're looking for in ADI. Then, add your company ID to your discord nickname in the `[Username] | [CO ID]` format, that way you can be more easily looked up in-game. Once that is all sent, please ping @jvaler to help you get roled! (If jvaler is offline any Admin or Coordinator role can also assist you)

@jvaler Looks like someone threw me outside of the airlock while I was sleeping.  Good thing I was suited up. 😅   Don't judge me- suit life support systems are very comfortable for getting a nap in.

As to what I'm looking for in ADI- my company is founded and currently headquartered in Antares.  As an trader, I'm looking to network with people from the Antares region to be able to better take part in the Antares economy.

I also would also like to be able to represent the Stardust Trading Corporation [DUST] here.

once you have a plan of action i'd love to provide an AGP grant to help get you that second base in antares ;P

but it's also fine if that second base isn't antarian, just won't be AGP eligible

Hello everyone,

I’m Caradan, the director of Cara Cosmic Harvest [CCH]. Our first base is located on the surface of Harmonia (Antares IV - Harmonia (ZV-896b)). Our company is currently an agricultural operation, but we aim to eventually shift towards the chemical industry if this project proves sufficiently profitable for us and our shareholders.

@jvaler Sorry for the delay in introducing myself.

Currently located on Antares-1, goal is a flexible manufacturing focused empire, yes I should have picked a manufacturing world for the bonus but hey, nobody's perfect


[28-Aug-24 06:27 AM] laaxus#0000
What's your planet ?


[28-Aug-24 06:27 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Phobos,


[28-Aug-24 06:29 AM] laaxus#0000
Alright, have fun ! if you have any question, don't hesitate


[28-Aug-24 06:36 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Thanks, I'm currently going off a $ per day per factory incl consumables and planning to move to a $ per day per 500 area base incl consumables once I've built my first up to maxcap. If that's a terrible idea I'd love to know because it just seems to math the best in my pea brain


[28-Aug-24 06:37 AM] laaxus#0000
let's discuss in #associate-office

@jvaler maybe ? i'm not exactly sure who to ping


[28-Aug-24 06:38 AM] laaxus#0000
Anyway, do you know about prunplanner ?


[28-Aug-24 06:39 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Yea. I kinda built my own version that's more focused on what I want to do with FIO links to keep it up to date


[28-Aug-24 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I did the same, that's great, half the fun of the game is doodling with excel


[28-Aug-24 06:41 AM] laaxus#0000
however, always double check on prunplanner, because it cost nothing to do it, but cost a lot to be wrong in your investment


[28-Aug-24 06:41 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, you can change the cx setting of your empire. By default it uses avg but I find that a terrible metric personnaly (many will disagree with me tho)


[28-Aug-24 06:42 AM] laaxus#0000
I personally set it up at buying at ask price, selling at bid


[28-Aug-24 06:42 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Yea that's what I've done


[28-Aug-24 06:42 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Anything I make off the better end of the spread is  a bonus not a given in my mind


[28-Aug-24 06:43 AM] laaxus#0000
that's only the case because you lack the capital but later on, you'll want to sell at ask and buy at bid to maximise profit
But you've got time before getting there


[28-Aug-24 06:43 AM] laaxus#0000
anyway, what's your plan ? what do you wish to produce in the next 2 weeks ?


[28-Aug-24 06:45 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Short term EXO with OVE AL is only $60 an hour per plant worse than MCG ATM which is the best but MCG requires so much more fuel due to the dumb volume. REP liquidity is too low at the top of the ASK and profits will dropoff fast if I do more than a quarter batch


[28-Aug-24 06:47 AM] laaxus#0000
Well you're absolutely right


[28-Aug-24 06:47 AM] laaxus#0000
because that's exactly what I'm doing


[28-Aug-24 06:48 AM] laaxus#0000
My first 500 area base is BMPs pumping EXO MCG and PE


[28-Aug-24 06:48 AM] laaxus#0000
I've done it on hephaestus tho


[28-Aug-24 06:49 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, you do not have to start on the starting planets : you can always leave and fly to start your base somewhere else. You're not limited to the 3 choices the system give you


[28-Aug-24 06:49 AM] laaxus#0000
just food for thought


[28-Aug-24 06:49 AM] dizzplaced#0000
That's the plan for my first as well. 
My second will either be 3D printer, textiles, med components or small components.


[28-Aug-24 06:50 AM] dizzplaced#0000
I'm not gonna coliq. I'm ok with making small mistakes


[28-Aug-24 06:50 AM] laaxus#0000
Well it seems you have stronger grasp on the game than usual beginners so I don't have any doubt you'll be ok


[28-Aug-24 06:51 AM] dizzplaced#0000
I've done up prof/loss for all those as well and I'll watch trends over time to make a decision when the time comes


[28-Aug-24 06:51 AM] laaxus#0000
but be careful with clothing : it's easy to produce more than the market consumes


[28-Aug-24 06:52 AM] dizzplaced#0000
You mean the 382K per day making ROM isn't sustainable 😭


[28-Aug-24 06:52 AM] laaxus#0000
it's not like you have the 344k that the building requires anyway


[28-Aug-24 06:53 AM] laaxus#0000
don't forget about checking if the market produce enough of your input goods tho


[28-Aug-24 06:53 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly I don't worry about you


[28-Aug-24 06:54 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, you can sell the fuel of your second ship to have a slightly higher capital to start with
You don't need 2 ships with a starter base


[28-Aug-24 06:55 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Yea I was jokin around. Part of me wants to be the high end high tech manufacturer making ships but the market just isn't really there yet from what I can see


[28-Aug-24 06:55 AM] laaxus#0000
are you coming from eve by chancce ?


[28-Aug-24 06:56 AM] laaxus#0000
it requires so much capital than only 2/3y + players can afford the capital


[28-Aug-24 06:56 AM] laaxus#0000
you have the time


[28-Aug-24 06:56 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Nah, never played eve but factorio is probably the closest thing I've done before and I went deeeep into that game


[28-Aug-24 06:56 AM] laaxus#0000
Well, I hope you like it


[28-Aug-24 06:56 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, do you know about the grant system ?


[28-Aug-24 06:57 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Not really. There was mention of it in the tutorial I think but that's about it.


[28-Aug-24 06:57 AM] laaxus#0000
It's not in game


[28-Aug-24 06:58 AM] laaxus#0000
new players can ask for a 1M AIC grant. Free money, do not have to return it.
You just have to showcase what you will do with this money


[28-Aug-24 06:58 AM] laaxus#0000
this allows new players to go faster, as the beginning is VERY slow


[28-Aug-24 07:00 AM] laaxus#0000

[28-Aug-24 07:00 AM] dizzplaced#0000
According to my planner that's 14 new BMPs and their habs. Probably would bump that down to 12 to give myself a good liquidity buffer


[28-Aug-24 07:00 AM] laaxus#0000
make it 10


[28-Aug-24 07:01 AM] laaxus#0000
you need a buffer for input goods


[28-Aug-24 07:01 AM] laaxus#0000
else you'll have to speedrun your way to the cx everyday


[28-Aug-24 07:01 AM] laaxus#0000
and buy at ask, sell at bid


[28-Aug-24 07:01 AM] laaxus#0000
that was my mistake


[28-Aug-24 07:01 AM] laaxus#0000
try to have 3 days input good buffer


[28-Aug-24 07:01 AM] laaxus#0000
and expand from there


[28-Aug-24 07:03 AM] dizzplaced#0000
I started doing that a couple of days ago. I had to build up a decent buffer. ATM I have 2 days buffer. Queue my prods so second last run finishes and gives me enough to time go to CX and back and list at bid


[28-Aug-24 07:09 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Where do I actually go and submit my plan?


[28-Aug-24 07:09 AM] laaxus#0000
somewhere in this server you can't access yet


[28-Aug-24 07:10 AM] dizzplaced#0000

this can help, too


[28-Aug-24 07:10 AM] laaxus#0000
(tho compared to the grant, it's not much)


[28-Aug-24 07:11 AM] laaxus#0000
there are many people willing to loan

[28-Aug-24 07:14 AM] laaxus#0000
he just want to help new players


[28-Aug-24 07:14 AM] laaxus#0000
new players are consumers for the market, and help feeding the dev : win win


[28-Aug-24 07:15 AM] laaxus#0000
the beginning is very slow and harsh (way to slow and harsh imo) so it helps


[28-Aug-24 07:15 AM] dizzplaced#0000
That's super cool. I'm not super keen on debt but I'll keep it in mind


[28-Aug-24 07:16 AM] laaxus#0000
to give you an idea, only 838 players have 3 bases and only 437 have 3 ships


[28-Aug-24 07:16 AM] laaxus#0000
worldwide


[28-Aug-24 07:16 AM] laaxus#0000
the playerbase is low


[28-Aug-24 07:16 AM] laaxus#0000
(this takes account of inactive players too)


[28-Aug-24 07:17 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Hmmm yea I guess a bigger economy is a better game economy pretty much anyway you slice it


[28-Aug-24 07:18 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly I'd like the dev team to higher 2-3 more full time dev
but for that, we need a bigger player base


[28-Aug-24 07:18 AM] laaxus#0000
and if new players that tries the game leaves after 2 days, it's not good


[28-Aug-24 07:19 AM] dizzplaced#0000
true. That early game would churn a lot of people


[28-Aug-24 07:19 AM] dizzplaced#0000
I only found the game after spending a week doing airlinesim and looked at simulogics other games


[28-Aug-24 07:19 AM] laaxus#0000
Coming from high dopamine games, I had a detox the first 2 days, so much I spent my urges on excel


[28-Aug-24 07:20 AM] laaxus#0000
I found the game in a reddit comment under a post about economic games


[28-Aug-24 07:20 AM] laaxus#0000
(spoiler, there aren't many good economic games)


[28-Aug-24 07:21 AM] dizzplaced#0000
Yea I've looked for years. Never found anything complicated enough. Victoria 3 was the closest I found before and it just didn't feel alive enough since it's just AI


[28-Aug-24 07:22 AM] laaxus#0000
I have 1.3k hours on V3


[28-Aug-24 07:22 AM] laaxus#0000
It's finally playable with SoI but not quite there yet


[28-Aug-24 07:22 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm burned so I probably gonna wait one more year to start to play it again


[28-Aug-24 07:23 AM] marat_sh#0000
I’ve started modding Vic3 for my own use. Feels way better


[28-Aug-24 07:24 AM] dizzplaced#0000
The AI just isn't good enough at its own game yet 😄


[28-Aug-24 07:24 AM] laaxus#0000
I was a big modder for V3


[28-Aug-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
I've modded the biggest AI mod ARoAI


[28-Aug-24 07:25 AM] marat_sh#0000
Ai doesn’t know who to run a deficit economy so they can’t compete


[28-Aug-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
but had to stop because of university


[28-Aug-24 07:25 AM] laaxus#0000
I know A LOT about the ai of v3 and let me tell you : it wont ever get better

👆 

[28-Aug-24 07:26 AM] laaxus#0000
it does not need to deficit spend, just SPENDING the money would already do wonders


[28-Aug-24 07:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
I mean they do spend… for more baracks 😅


[28-Aug-24 07:26 AM] dizzplaced#0000
You'd think they would just build some construction but no....baracks


[28-Aug-24 07:28 AM] marat_sh#0000

[28-Aug-24 07:29 AM] laaxus#0000
I was the only modder in the community who understood the mess that was ARoAI
I've made it better, improved it a lot.
My AI Mod was the best on the market when I was working (almost full time) on it
but god DAMN does Jomini SUCKS

The more you put them on rails the less "real" it feels imo

Good rails are better than a cliff tho I have to admit


[28-Aug-24 07:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I like to explain V3 AI issue like this :

They hired a DnD roleplayers and tried to teach him macro economics,
When they should have hired an economist and then teached him to roleplay


[28-Aug-24 07:35 AM] laaxus#0000
To have AI roleplaying is great, but they must know how to manage their economies first


[28-Aug-24 07:36 AM] dizzplaced#0000
The clausewitz engine table they're sitting at *💀🔥🧨⛽


[28-Aug-24 07:37 AM] laaxus#0000
Clausewitz is half of the reason why I  have little hopes about PDX futures
It's unoptimised as fuck and they do not have the dev time to make it better

Hello, I'm located in HRT. I started on Promitor and expanded to Avalon making a bunch of rations. I'm thinking about expanding to Antares space once I'm done with my first 2 bases.

Are there any opportunities if I were to setup a base in Antares space where I wouldn't need to do much/any shipping? My 2 starter ships are currently busy keeping my base in Avalon stocked, and I'm not sure if I would be able to spare the shipping capacity to have a ship floating around ANT space.


[03-Sep-24 09:08 AM] laaxus#0000
you would need at least one ship imho


[03-Sep-24 09:17 AM] jcheung#0000
Chemical has some options that don't see much shipping


[03-Sep-24 09:17 AM] jcheung#0000
You could probably pay for someone else to ship for you on the LM


[03-Sep-24 09:17 AM] jcheung#0000
Or run a ship over once every other week


[03-Sep-24 09:17 AM] laaxus#0000
FLX especially


[03-Sep-24 09:18 AM] laaxus#0000
I think its the best option with a low shipping capacity constraint


[03-Sep-24 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
Or, for some planets like elon, there are a lot of people here that run light there fairly regularly


[03-Sep-24 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
Flx... LST isn't super light


[03-Sep-24 09:18 AM] jcheung#0000
But yeah, that's certainly an option


[03-Sep-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
My spreadsheet tells me it's the only chem product with low daily input weight/volume and a reasonable RoI


[03-Sep-24 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
The others are MED and NST, but I'd not recommend them


[03-Sep-24 09:25 AM] jcheung#0000
That's fair.


[03-Sep-24 06:18 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Chem in general is quite good. Planning well you should cover 5-6 chem bases with a single LCB

Hi, I am -brand- new, just exploring and looking for a passive game I can play while doing other things.  Started as Metallurgist, planning to go easy with maybe some steel production or something.  Antares I - Phobos

[07-Sep-24 08:01 AM] farnite#0000
I mean, it looked like I could do some time a couple of times a day and other than that it's a bit of waiting for things to be produced, ships to fly around, etc


[07-Sep-24 08:01 AM] laaxus#0000
Oh you Can, as long as you don't fall in the spreadsheet rabit hole

welcome! considering you're *brand* new, have you considered changing your start to Deimos? Phobos' CoGC(Chamber of Global Commerce) only gives a bonus to buildings in the Electronics category, but Deimos' CoGC gives a bonus to buildings in the Metallurgy category. it can make a significant difference, especially because Metallurgy margins can become quite tight depending on market circumstances.


[07-Sep-24 03:37 PM] farnite#0000
Interesting, I didn't realize planets had bonuses like that.  Deimos doesn't seem to have iron though, so should I buy Iron from cx adn then make steel and send the steel back to cx?


[07-Sep-24 03:40 PM] laaxus#0000
yes

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-Sep-24 03:41 PM] laaxus#0000
tho I would not recommend STL


[07-Sep-24 03:41 PM] laaxus#0000
there's no margin


[07-Sep-24 03:41 PM] farnite#0000
Gotcha, yeah seems like it might be an 'easy entry' thing for new players


[07-Sep-24 03:42 PM] laaxus#0000
as you start, you have an advantage over people that have a full base : You don't have to supply 20 buildings


[07-Sep-24 03:42 PM] laaxus#0000
but only 2 or 3


[07-Sep-24 03:43 PM] laaxus#0000
there are few sme recipe that are very profitable, but people don't use them because it is supply hell


[07-Sep-24 03:43 PM] laaxus#0000
which is not your case


[07-Sep-24 03:43 PM] laaxus#0000
won't tell you what recipes it is, find it yourself, it's part of the fun 😄


[07-Sep-24 03:43 PM] farnite#0000
Hehe Ok


[07-Sep-24 04:51 PM] jcheung#0000
If you're dead set on FE, try vulcan


[07-Sep-24 04:51 PM] jcheung#0000
Be warned though, it's a pain in the balls to ship the stuff. Quite heavy


[07-Sep-24 04:52 PM] tanda#0000
I recommend still going Deimos. If you're interested in FE, I'm happy to sponsor an initial SME/PP1 setup over on Vulcan


[07-Sep-24 04:52 PM] tanda#0000
but Deimos is shut to non-new players, and it's still one of the best metallurgy planets in the sector


[07-Sep-24 04:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Plus it's not the worst thing to get started on for AL refining. Has ALO that isn't terrible yield there


[07-Sep-24 04:53 PM] razenpok#0000
Vulcan is a bad advice for a new player imo, it requires HSE


[07-Sep-24 04:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Eh


[07-Sep-24 04:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Fair


[07-Sep-24 04:53 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, it's not great. It's a compromise if they're set on FE, though

[07-Sep-24 04:54 PM] jcheung#0000
Can still get ore there though pretty easily


[07-Sep-24 04:54 PM] igfloz#0000
yeah, HSE is a bit expensive to build on Vulcan for a new player

not telling you that you have to, but just that's it's an option

[08-Sep-24 02:05 PM] laaxus#0000
btw coliq DELETE EVERYTHING

it's basically deleting your account


[08-Sep-24 02:05 PM] jcheung#0000
i suggest spending at least a couple days messing around learning stuff before doing that

✅ 

[08-Sep-24 02:05 PM] laaxus#0000
but then you can start from scratch, choose Antares initiative faction and start on deimos as metalurgist


[08-Sep-24 02:20 PM] chriswalters0326#0000
so when i coliq do i just restart with the same name and just change the faction location basically?

RIGs on harmonia hurts my soul tho... it's more profitable to just buy H2O off the CX and go full FRM instead

but right now I can't afford the transport time of Thallasa


[08-Sep-24 04:37 PM] jvaler#0000
13 FRM is ~35-45k/d profit depending on the recipe, 35 RIG is a paltry ~15k/d


[08-Sep-24 04:38 PM] jvaler#0000
on harmonia that is


[08-Sep-24 04:38 PM] jvaler#0000
35 RIG on ISA is actually quite profitable


[08-Sep-24 04:38 PM] tanda#0000
it's rather rough having HYF at all before you get a 2k/2k

Heyo
Antares II - Deimos, just started the game and I was told a corp is the way to go, so I'm hoping to join ADI to improve my gameplay experience, and hopefully improve the experience of others as well.

ADI is more of a community then corp. We do have corps here, but we are working together for a benefit of a faction as a whole


[10-Sep-24 01:13 PM] epeon_#0000
Oh I see, I came from UFO you see.


[10-Sep-24 01:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
ADI is about communication between player in Antares space... more social aspect of the game


[10-Sep-24 01:15 PM] marat_sh#0000
if you are looking for a Corp HQ boost for production, you can ask around

Hey! I am looking into doing my second and final liquidation and starting in Antares. I am currently located in NEO (not that it matters if I am going to liq). I want to cooperate from the get-go (being someone's "subsidiary" of sorts or straight up starting in a corp). If that's not possible, then I will probably just go Promitor FRM into Norwick FP. Please, give me the member role whenever you can @jvaler , and thank you!


[16-Sep-24 10:32 AM] jcheung#0000
uhm. if you want to be someone's subsidiary... pay isn't amazing but it's certainly not bad... @riseoffilth got one with a pulse here


[16-Sep-24 10:35 AM] jvaler#0000
aluminum alliance also has some more structured projects that seem to have open slots https://discord.gg/xVpGKTHq


[16-Sep-24 10:35 AM] taenar#0000
Well, I'd hopefully eventually grow into more of a partner lol. More than anything it's that I enjoy that sort of mentorship dynamic


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
one of us, one of us


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
yes, promitor is the best start, always recommend there


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
BUT


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
antares is the best region


[16-Sep-24 02:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and tons of projects and money making opportunities around here


[16-Sep-24 02:14 PM] laaxus#0000
better than deimos ?
I'm not so sure


[16-Sep-24 02:19 PM] riseoffilth#0000
anywhere can make AL. Only fertile planets can house farms, and promitor is the best


[16-Sep-24 02:20 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Nascent is a better extraction planet, and there is a metallurgy planet a jump away at IY-816c


[16-Sep-24 02:20 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Deimos is nice, but its no promitor

Hey, my name is Onoya, currently located in Harmonia ( antares IV ) and doing Carbon.

I've came with several friends that are located in the Antares Initiative faction, and for now, we are just developping

I'm playing since 26 days, soon maxing my first base and will probably do another base to do fuel.
My plan in the far future is maybe coordinate with some people to start colonizing an empty planet etc...

Hello, started with PrUn around 3 days ago. I'm located on Deimos (ZV-759 c), Antares II, and started as a metalurgist. Currently I'm just trying to understand the game and its mechanics, while I setup a AL production to finance further expansions.
@jvaler

Hey, new player since today just setup on Phobos Antares I. Not really got a plan yet as I haven't explored too much of what the game has to offer but I lost far too much time in spreadsheets trading on EVE and have a feeling I'll be here a while. Seemed a good idea to link up with other ADI folks 🙂

Hello! New player as of nearly a month ago, been slowly expanding my base on Antares II as a metallurgist. Currently looking at further expanding my AL production lines and possibly expanding to a different planet that I can get C from so I don't have to buy it anymore. Still a free license at the moment while I weigh whether or not I want to pay for Pro. Thought it'd be a good idea to get my foot in the door regardless.

getting C production will likely require... hmmm. to do it efficiently, 2 planets. to do it less efficiently, at least one.


[18-Sep-24 06:53 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm worried about your shipping capacity 😅


[18-Sep-24 06:54 PM] squidbelt#0000
Well, C production would be well after expanding my existing AL line. :^) I haven't even considered what that would look like yet, logistically speaking.


[18-Sep-24 06:55 PM] tanda#0000
C isn't too too bad with starter ships. I ran full SME, full INC and full FRM bases with 500/500s


[18-Sep-24 06:55 PM] tanda#0000
they were always busy but yeah, not too bad


[18-Sep-24 06:56 PM] jcheung#0000

[18-Sep-24 06:56 PM] jcheung#0000
fair


[19-Sep-24 01:40 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That was my first impulse too, setting up an own C line, until everybody told me its a bad idea... just tested it on Deimos in PrunPlaner - its actually more expensive to produce it yourself (building costs not included) to produce your own carbon, then just buying it from market. 
You would probably need to setup another base on a more efficient planet for that to be lucrative.

[19-Sep-24 08:22 AM] grieverem#0000
Hi everyone, I'm located in Antares II - Deimos (ZV-759c) and I started as a metallurgist. I started a couple days ago, extracting ALO and smelting it into AL with the short-term goal of selling it to finance further expansion of the same production; I'm currently planning to build a FP to produce my own RAT and reduce upkeep expenses, but I'm still not sure it's worth the effort  😅


[19-Sep-24 08:23 AM] grieverem#0000
In the long-term I'd like to try some manufacturing after expanding my mineral production, but I'm new to the game and so far I figured it'll take quite a long time to get there


[19-Sep-24 08:24 AM] laaxus#0000
no, it's better to specialise planets
It would be cheaper to buy rat from the market than produce it
Especially right now that rat is so cheap


[19-Sep-24 08:24 AM] laaxus#0000
welcome !


[19-Sep-24 08:26 AM] grieverem#0000
Thank you! I already bought the materials for building the FP and complete a few batches of :RAT: , but I guess I can use those for other constructions such as EXT and SME, if you suggest it's better that way


[19-Sep-24 08:27 AM] laaxus#0000
as long as you didn't build the fp too long ago, you could destroy it for no cost


[19-Sep-24 08:27 AM] grieverem#0000
(also sorry if I make some errors, English is my 2nd language; feel free to correct me on that, too 😉 )


[19-Sep-24 08:28 AM] grieverem#0000
no no, the materials are still on route to the base


[19-Sep-24 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
I am a bit busy right now, so I can't help you much more, but I'm pretty sure others will help you soon
you should not build the fp, keep the material for now


[19-Sep-24 08:38 AM] grieverem#0000
np, thank you for your help!


[19-Sep-24 08:38 AM] jvaler#0000
manufacturing is a great option! very profitable and very flexible.

with AGP it can be closer than you think https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1254642134317793300

PE production is much less profitable


[19-Sep-24 08:39 AM] laaxus#0000

though yours is actually more accurate of a metric than prunplanner

indeed


[19-Sep-24 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
I would personnaly recommend a pp2 base


[19-Sep-24 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
that's what's best atm, imho

[19-Sep-24 08:52 AM] razenpok#0000

I've been spinning for a few days mentally, tons of planning in PRUNplanner comparing starts, the idea of Antares just appeals to me as sort of an RP perspective, both green and orange factions. Guess it's the Eve player in me preferring Gallente and Minmatar roughing it and making it work


[19-Sep-24 12:41 PM] kynadre#0000
I really, really wanted to do a fuel start on Phobos but I realized I couldn't afford the addtl settle materials since fuel indy stuff is so expensive input


[19-Sep-24 12:41 PM] kynadre#0000
been ping-ponging between manuf. on hephaestus and metallurgy on deimos as alternative starts, to branch out later


[19-Sep-24 12:41 PM] jcheung#0000
🌊


[19-Sep-24 12:42 PM] jvaler#0000
fuel on phobos is intersting... but i feel like you can get way better milage by picking a planet you can actually align yourself to the CoGC on


[19-Sep-24 12:42 PM] jvaler#0000
electronics CoGC sucks ass for newbies


[19-Sep-24 12:42 PM] jcheung#0000
fuel on phobos isn't ideal


[19-Sep-24 12:42 PM] jcheung#0000
it's not the worst thing you could do there, but it's not great


[19-Sep-24 12:42 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, I understand that. I've gotten quite a lot of ping-ponged ideas the past few days from a food start on Verdant to fuel start on Harpina, but travel time to market as a new player w/o much buffer is bad


[19-Sep-24 12:43 PM] kynadre#0000
yeah


[19-Sep-24 12:43 PM] kynadre#0000
It makes a lot more sense that I do stuff in Antares to begin with that works with local bonuses


[19-Sep-24 12:43 PM] marat_sh#0000
Welcome 🎉


[19-Sep-24 12:43 PM] jvaler#0000
well with AGP you'll have the capital to buy plenty of buffer to negate that concern. logi throughput would be your only issue

you can also probably arrange for materials to be delivered to hep and you can move your ship from phobos to hep (just saw your chat in the other server)


[19-Sep-24 12:46 PM] kynadre#0000
first one I flew out to a hydrogen planet and then realized I needed gas base stuff and pressure stuff... flew back... realized I couldn't afford it... cried a bit


[19-Sep-24 12:46 PM] jcheung#0000
or there's a fuel refining planet in anteres II


[19-Sep-24 12:46 PM] kynadre#0000
didn't really cry but you know

[19-Sep-24 12:47 PM] jcheung#0000
🤷


[19-Sep-24 12:47 PM] kynadre#0000
yeah I'll take a look, it makes sense to separate bases by function, whether extraction or industry, for best end bonuses


[19-Sep-24 12:47 PM] jcheung#0000
i can supply a small amount of GAL should you pursue that option, but probably not enough for you to run SF full time if you go that route


[19-Sep-24 12:48 PM] jvaler#0000
i feel like LS-746b is a better first pick for fuel refining. INS+HSE is pricey

{Reactions}
💯 

[19-Sep-24 12:48 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah no worries at all, that's the cheapest thing on the market


[19-Sep-24 12:49 PM] kynadre#0000
did I explore that one? I've got 2 other LS planets in my test plans


[19-Sep-24 12:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
@kynadre don't forget to check the internal offers channel


[19-Sep-24 12:49 PM] kynadre#0000
Yep literally unaffordable by a new start


[19-Sep-24 12:49 PM] jvaler#0000
someone recently came in with a plan to do just that actually https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1254643011980234863/1286324047541571605

the profit and ROI look great on it


[19-Sep-24 12:49 PM] jcheung#0000

[19-Sep-24 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
also SF is still stabilizing after the MM price increase


[19-Sep-24 12:50 PM] kynadre#0000
I just need a start start to propel me towards getting the fuelbase going on Harpina so I can bring home the bacon to Antares markets


[19-Sep-24 12:50 PM] jcheung#0000
it'll probably hit MM in around a month in some places i think

[19-Sep-24 12:51 PM] kynadre#0000
fuel production bonus and healthy local supply of H


[19-Sep-24 12:51 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm i see


[19-Sep-24 12:51 PM] jvaler#0000
INS tho...


[19-Sep-24 12:52 PM] jcheung#0000
fuel refineries are pretty fat


[19-Sep-24 12:52 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, but the ROI is 22 days


[19-Sep-24 12:52 PM] kynadre#0000
Hm I guess the price of H went down cuz it used to be 16 days in the plan


[19-Sep-24 12:53 PM] jvaler#0000
13 REF on LS-746b shows 13d ROI with BUY/BUY CX settings

[19-Sep-24 12:53 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah the problem is you see that cost to operate at the very top? Importing for fuel production requires HUGE cash buffer up front


[19-Sep-24 12:53 PM] kynadre#0000
That's why Harpina would negate about half of that by having local H

can i get a link to this? wanna see what the profits are on those COL


[19-Sep-24 12:55 PM] kynadre#0000
when I was looking at plans it was 3k a day, less than half of SF, but I still did my planning around half of it being FF anyway


[19-Sep-24 12:55 PM] jcheung#0000
with how much fuel is used, its price is pretty liquid if you're willing to wait a couple days

Argon's kinda universally shafted in the game, max 20%


[19-Sep-24 12:57 PM] kynadre#0000
yet necessary


[19-Sep-24 12:58 PM] jvaler#0000
ingame % bars are pretty useless, basing yield on universal maxes is more useful of a metric


[19-Sep-24 12:58 PM] jvaler#0000
which is what i like https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch for


[19-Sep-24 12:58 PM] jvaler#0000
hovering the resource bars tells you the universe max


[19-Sep-24 12:58 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, the green bars in PRUNplanner are pretty accurate to what universe max is I noticed


[19-Sep-24 12:59 PM] kynadre#0000
I found someone's spreadsheet that has the data on every resource and the "difficulty cost" (tier) of settling at them

break it down by up-front investment costs, basically, versus the over time outputs you're going to get

been doing so many comparisons


[19-Sep-24 01:01 PM] kynadre#0000
plus when anything's "valuable" I'm comparing markets for actual volumes traded, what it's used for, finding out like, surprise no one actually uses W because they can just use FE instead, or whatever


[19-Sep-24 01:01 PM] kynadre#0000
or that F looks high because it's rarely used so people just "vanity post" their listing

same for MAG like, if you need like 5 for a spaceship, why bother

so if you're gonna be on harpina, are you gonna leave behind a ship in MOR when you come to ANT?


[19-Sep-24 01:04 PM] kynadre#0000
oh Harpina's going to be profit center to fuel (financially and literally) doing construction stuff I think


[19-Sep-24 01:04 PM] kynadre#0000
starting with metallurgy on Deimos for initial profits, grow some profit input planets, get Harpina going, get manufacturing going on Hephaestus once I have enough inputs coming in

[19-Sep-24 01:06 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah


[19-Sep-24 01:06 PM] kynadre#0000
I'm literally still learning like, what's the difference between construction and manufacturing


[19-Sep-24 01:06 PM] jvaler#0000
AL is used much less in manufacturing, it's more FE/STL there


[19-Sep-24 01:06 PM] kynadre#0000
makes sense


[19-Sep-24 01:06 PM] jvaler#0000
and for FE/STL we have vulcan

I planned out some planets for BOR (for fuel), BER, HAL, BRM, SIO, LIO, LST, SIL... just takes time to figure out options


[19-Sep-24 01:07 PM] jvaler#0000
construction is mostly prefabs and certain specialty construction materials like HSE, whereas manufacturing is either consumables or intermediates

[19-Sep-24 01:08 PM] jvaler#0000
make sure not to focus too hard on raw resource extraction, the goal should still be profits. and shipping raw resources is a big burden for a new player with only 2 starter ships

{Reactions}
👍 

[19-Sep-24 01:09 PM] jvaler#0000
resource extraction still makes sense in a lot of cases though, like that harpina example.


[19-Sep-24 01:09 PM] jvaler#0000
another would be LST on nike to feed PP2


[19-Sep-24 01:10 PM] jvaler#0000
not necessarily ALO on deimos though, as it's often cheaper to import/buy off the LM ALO and use your base area for more SME instead


[19-Sep-24 01:10 PM] jvaler#0000
main reason you'd want EXT on deimos is to reduce logi strain


[19-Sep-24 01:10 PM] kynadre#0000
That makes sense. If a planet doesn't have a lot of a resource, it ends up being a waste of space to get a trickle of something in addition to its main focus


[19-Sep-24 01:10 PM] jvaler#0000
yup yup


[19-Sep-24 01:11 PM] jvaler#0000
especially if it's CoGC isn't aligned to resource extraction

{Reactions}
👆 

[19-Sep-24 01:11 PM] jvaler#0000
but ALO just happens to be a really saturated market in ANT. even on a dedicated ALO(and C) planet like nascent, it's not impressively profitable for how much logi it takes


[19-Sep-24 01:12 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, makes sense. I saw how much more supply than demand is on market and that it's close prices, too, aka actually oversaturated and not just price inflaters trying to dom the market


[19-Sep-24 01:12 PM] kynadre#0000
just like carbon jfc


[19-Sep-24 01:12 PM] jvaler#0000
i haven't checked on carbon in a while, lemme see


[19-Sep-24 01:12 PM] kynadre#0000
I'm kinda surprised how many people pick up carbon farming as a starter, but it is so fundamentally necessary, too


[19-Sep-24 01:13 PM] jvaler#0000
oh wow that's nice

[19-Sep-24 01:14 PM] jvaler#0000
though factoring in the fact that you need your own FRM base to feed something like this it makes sense


[19-Sep-24 01:15 PM] jvaler#0000
the FRMs themselves aren't all that profitable(even though they have great ROI periods), so the profits are lopsided into the INC


[19-Sep-24 01:15 PM] jvaler#0000
need, because the CX agri market is very thin and can't reliably supply many INC

{Reactions}
👆 

[19-Sep-24 01:16 PM] kynadre#0000
Yeah, the main thing was that the market is so supply heavy atm, that it makes the most sense to make it for personal cost savings in their own production chain


[19-Sep-24 01:16 PM] kynadre#0000
when I looked at C specifically


[19-Sep-24 01:16 PM] kynadre#0000
my avg. profits dropped if I added INC to my verdant plans compared to just staying pure farming/as-needed extraction, but moving into a metallurgy production chain at the end of it brought it right back up again


[19-Sep-24 01:18 PM] jvaler#0000

Right the other factor was that Deimos requires being 1st-base to settle as it's capped but the others have availability, yes, that settles that plan

aye makes sense. I'm seeing how much it takes to just get to the CX and back jeez


[19-Sep-24 03:17 PM] kynadre#0000
no wonder STL is always in demand


[19-Sep-24 03:24 PM] jcheung#0000
pro tip, if you absolutely need to squeeze your SF supplies to the limit... you can simply reduce how much fuel is in your tank

{Reactions}
👀 

[19-Sep-24 03:24 PM] jcheung#0000
at least until you hit the absolute minimums for travel


[19-Sep-24 03:24 PM] jcheung#0000
tradeoff usually is, lower SF consumption, more damage to ship, longer flight time.
lower FF consumption, less damage to ship, longer flight time


[19-Sep-24 03:38 PM] kynadre#0000
Huh, not just the slider but the amount in your tank, too?


[19-Sep-24 03:40 PM] jvaler#0000
fuel has weight so it will affect STL flight slightly

{Reactions}

[19-Sep-24 03:41 PM] jvaler#0000
not worth worrying about minmaxing though imo, especially with the risk of misjudging and leaving yourself stranded

{Reactions}

[19-Sep-24 03:41 PM] jcheung#0000
well. starter ship doesn't care about weight


[19-Sep-24 03:41 PM] jcheung#0000
starter ship limit when full is acceleration


[19-Sep-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
but the lower limit of the slider is affected by amount of gas in the tank. just put the fuel in your cargo hold so you don't strand yourself.

[19-Sep-24 03:46 PM] jcheung#0000
it's a small amount, but if you really have to squeeze every last drop because you (i) goofed up


[19-Sep-24 03:46 PM] jvaler#0000
huh...


[19-Sep-24 03:46 PM] getonthetrain#0000
small amounts over time add up


[19-Sep-24 03:46 PM] jcheung#0000
tradeoff ofc is higher damage


[19-Sep-24 03:47 PM] jcheung#0000
and slower flight


[19-Sep-24 03:47 PM] archielvahr#0000
oh I misread at first, interesting!

but i've used this twice to stop myself from being stranded when i forgot to top off


[19-Sep-24 03:47 PM] getonthetrain#0000
honestly I had ignored testing that since cargo weight seemed to do nothing to the starter ships, but thanks for this tip


[19-Sep-24 03:48 PM] jcheung#0000
now, i just leave 100 FF and 100 SF at each of my bases 😅

not necessarily most cost efficient to repair here, 45d or 60d is better for that. but if you plan on demolishing it eventually then just letting it run until ~110d seems like a good idea


[20-Sep-24 06:46 PM] papamarianio#0000
is that like an intentional game feature or like a typical drop-off point?


[20-Sep-24 06:47 PM] jvaler#0000
it's just how the math works out

I'm located on Antares IV - Harmonia (ZV-896B). Started with Fuel production, but pivoting into other sectors, currently started on producing nutrient solution and seeing where that takes me. Looking into getting more advanced production up and running. Really finding this game to providing me some relief in between work.

[23-Sep-24 10:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Welcome @_______________________________., happy to have you here 🥳 

I started as a metallurgist on Deimos like a week ago. Probably one of the best things to do as  a beginner is to build up you starter base (all of the available 500 space). This gives you a good financial basis to look for the next step.

As @jvaler already pointed out, the ADI is giving out ₳1,000,000 AIC to new players to speed up the early game grind quite  a bit. All details are listed in the linked channel.

Other then that, people are really helpful here and it's a great way to get a better grip for the game.


[23-Sep-24 02:02 PM] sn3ksc#0000
Was pretty surprised to see how slow na sells


[23-Sep-24 02:03 PM] sn3ksc#0000
I probably bought more by accident from u then anybody in the past 20 days lol


[23-Sep-24 02:06 PM] sn3ksc#0000
Gonna be fun to see how long it'll take to sell off, probably gonna take a month and half given by how quickly ur order was filling


[23-Sep-24 02:06 PM] laaxus#0000
just sell it to the MM ?


[23-Sep-24 02:06 PM] sn3ksc#0000
I don't want it sold though hahaha


[23-Sep-24 02:07 PM] sn3ksc#0000
Gonna do a social experiment to see how long it takes to fill


[23-Sep-24 02:08 PM] sn3ksc#0000
Would be sensible to sell to the mm at 0.1 above mm ur only getting 500 in profit which is nothing

there's no guilt attached to AGP


[23-Sep-24 02:29 PM] laaxus#0000

yes, that was a joke, but he can't know


[23-Sep-24 02:29 PM] jcheung#0000

Heya all, I'm just joining this server in regards to your Gateway project planning - the oogcapitalmanagement webpage mentioned that this is the discord to join!

Personally, I'm based around Moria, and am one of the few still active SuperNova people. I'm working with a few other SuperNova people to organise Gateway construction in our area, and so would love to help coordinate between regions 🙂

Hello everyone, followed Rek here with all the talk of Gateways.
I'm also one of the few still active SNF players, mainly based in Moria and my closest base to Antares space is Etherwind.
Hoping to co-ordinate gateway construction and connect all CX regions - maybe then Antares will be close enough I'll set up a base 😄

Hey.
First day player here.
I played while ago little bit but old progress has been terminated.
Started in Katoa and doing my first Carbon.

While doing research it was mentioned alot that one shoud look into joining corporation early.

What I'm looking from ADI is community, hopefully some united goals to achieve and perhaps some guidance.

I am very willing to move bases, adjust fire or even starting over as I have pretty much nothing established.

Hey!
Yeah, I figured that.

Any specific route I should take to be useful as soon as possible?


[30-Sep-24 08:23 AM] saltymaggot#0000
Don't mind taking little bit less profitable route if it can contribute to some kind of bigger goal.


[30-Sep-24 08:23 AM] jvaler#0000
imo any low tier production is viable, but recently food processors are highly profitable


[30-Sep-24 08:24 AM] jvaler#0000
ADI is less commodity production oriented and more community/new player onboarding oriented. i could point you towards the aluminum alliance group if you're looking for something to contribute to though? and you'd still be eligible for AGP of course


[30-Sep-24 08:25 AM] jvaler#0000
over in AA they have quite a few co-ops, though open slots aren't guaranteed


[30-Sep-24 08:26 AM] jvaler#0000
however currently i think @riseoffilth has spots open for AFC, a co-op that makes RAT, DW, FIM, and MEA

[30-Sep-24 08:32 AM] jvaler#0000
phobos sucks ass, harmonia is okay, but deimos is exclusive to new players. so if your base is gonna get funded by AGP/rise anyways, i'd recommend choosing deimos as you can't get a base there any other way

{Reactions}
pepeLove 💯 

[30-Sep-24 08:32 AM] jvaler#0000
(deimos is limited to new players only because the planet is over the plot limit. this means only first-time bases can be built there now)


[30-Sep-24 08:33 AM] saltymaggot#0000
Well, I guess it's Deimos then. 
On mobile atm, I prefer starting over when on computer and it takes me little while to get back to one.

Hello, I found you all on the UFO server. I'm based out of Benten, but looking to expand to Antares. I've established 3 bases over the past week (soon to be 4), and am trying to make use of all the new player opportunities provided by kind souls such as yourselves. I'd love to be a part of a production project like PG or INS if there is anything available currently.

[01-Oct-24 12:31 PM] jcheung#0000
what are your 3 bases currently doing?


[01-Oct-24 12:33 PM] superbadsounds#0000
agriculture @ Proxion, manufacturing @ Katoa, and support for those two via chemistry/manufacturing @  Umbra.

Soon to spin up is Miliways for Food and Malahat for IDC's via another project

do you have any specific thing you want to produce in ANT, or just want to join the club


[01-Oct-24 12:49 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I'd just like to contribute and get into something new. There seem to be some complex material flows for the higher tier production, so I'm really just trying to get exposure to the different industries and diversify intelligently. If that means more profits too, I'm not gonna complain.


[01-Oct-24 12:52 PM] superbadsounds#0000
I really enjoy base optimization. I've spent exponentially more time in prunplanner than the actual game haha.

Thank you! I'm based on Deimos, just started playing a couple of days ago and was recommended heading here from a kind soul in UFO. I'm currently not entirely certain what my long term goals will be since I'm still getting around the mechanics, it's a bit daunting tbh so I'm mainly here for tips and advice on how to get the MONEY MAKING MACHINE rolling! Space capitalism fuck yeah!

Currently I only have an extractor and smelter up and running, I haven't sent my first shipment out yet but I'm planning on delaying until I need to restock on rations, water etc. When setting up new production lines should I try to base them on what I already produce or is it safe to go for wildly different lines where I just import all the commodities I need? Also, any tips on what to do after I sold my first shipment?

[02-Oct-24 03:14 PM] jcheung#0000
Matching COGC is a good idea. To fogure out what that is, open planet info and find chamber of global commerce


[02-Oct-24 03:14 PM] jcheung#0000
For example, SME, or smelters, are metallurgy

[02-Oct-24 03:26 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
Well lucky me Metallurgy seems to have overwhelming support on Deimos, is it wise to build several smelters and collectors to start with or should I try to move on to the higher tiers of metallurgy that requires settlers?


[02-Oct-24 03:27 PM] laaxus#0000
Stay on smelters for now


[02-Oct-24 03:27 PM] laaxus#0000
AL Will Always Always sell


[02-Oct-24 03:27 PM] laaxus#0000
And that's something you want early on


[02-Oct-24 03:27 PM] laaxus#0000
Taking risk isn't recommended


[02-Oct-24 03:33 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
Alright, thanks for the tip. I'll make sure to buy materials for furthers smelters as well then when I sell my first shipment!


[02-Oct-24 03:41 PM] laaxus#0000
You should also put a few ext


[02-Oct-24 03:41 PM] laaxus#0000

Hello I am located at Deimos just started playing yesterday so just trying to find my footing and figure out what to do and how to expand. My goal I guess is to produce and refine as many ores as I can since shiny rocks are pretty cool

{Reactions}
👋 

[02-Oct-24 03:53 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
@laaxus Carbon seems to be pretty vital for SME, would it be wise to set up a production line for that as well or should I stick to just buying it for now?


[02-Oct-24 03:55 PM] kynadre#0000
You'll want to specialize each base as you can, so since C is a separate kind of production, you'll want to set it up at a planet that can get bonuses towards it


[02-Oct-24 03:55 PM] kynadre#0000
there's an entire 50% production bonus you can get per planet via specialization (25% from planet bonus, 28.4% from expert bonus)


[02-Oct-24 03:56 PM] kynadre#0000
expanding in the future to reduce your own costs is a wise move when done at separate bases


[02-Oct-24 03:57 PM] kynadre#0000
or networking with others as you can do here 🙂


[02-Oct-24 03:58 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
Haha yeah for sure. If some friendly Antares sector space farmer wants to sell me his genetically modified corn I won't argue.

[02-Oct-24 04:54 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
So I've been crunching the numbers on supplies I should get on my first visit to the CX and I'm probably gonna go negative after purchasing all the necessary supplies for upkeep, further production and setting up a new extractor and smelter. Is this normal or am I just fucking up somewhere?


[02-Oct-24 04:55 PM] getonthetrain#0000
uh, maybe you're trying to do too much at once - this game is normally a long burn

{Reactions}
💯 

[02-Oct-24 04:55 PM] getonthetrain#0000
first trip maybe just focus on selling what you have made so far, and getting more items you need to produce

{Reactions}
💯 

[02-Oct-24 04:56 PM] getonthetrain#0000
then second trip you might have enough to expand


[02-Oct-24 04:56 PM] getonthetrain#0000
tutorial missions and the random ones you get when tutorial ends will often give you building materials to expand with

{Reactions}
💯 

[02-Oct-24 04:56 PM] getonthetrain#0000
if you are patient


[02-Oct-24 04:57 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
I gotta get DW, RAT and OVE (getting enough for 5 days) as well as carbon and oxygen for further smelting as well as potentially refueling (but this is optional) and I was planning on getting supplies for at least a smelter to up my AL production. Am I overreaching?

{Reactions}
👍 

[02-Oct-24 04:57 PM] getonthetrain#0000
it's most important to ALWAYS have your buildings producing


[02-Oct-24 04:58 PM] getonthetrain#0000
and people fed, of course


[02-Oct-24 04:58 PM] getonthetrain#0000
at the start, PWO (padded overalls) is a good luxury to get


[02-Oct-24 04:58 PM] getonthetrain#0000
when you have money to burn, you can get them coffee


[02-Oct-24 04:58 PM] getonthetrain#0000
so food, water, and whatever you need to produce


[02-Oct-24 04:59 PM] getonthetrain#0000
send your ship super slow to the CX and back to conserve fuel


[02-Oct-24 04:59 PM] getonthetrain#0000
and next time you might be able to expand


[02-Oct-24 04:59 PM] getonthetrain#0000
in a few days


[02-Oct-24 05:00 PM] getonthetrain#0000
but you also don't need to refuel on that first trip if you go slow


[02-Oct-24 05:02 PM] kynadre#0000
Food and production inputs for about a week, and if there isn't enough leftover for both upgrades to your base, do either one or the other, or look at the worker luxuries which are a far cheaper investment and still improve your output


[02-Oct-24 05:03 PM] kynadre#0000
plus like, if you double refineries but not extractors, you're going to need to double your inputs XD


[02-Oct-24 05:04 PM] kynadre#0000
AND you'd need to build the population building possibly, too (if you don't have 50-60 spare population already)


[02-Oct-24 05:04 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
So basically, send the shipment and after selling the AL I'll have to see then what I can afford 😅

{Reactions}
💯 👍 

[02-Oct-24 05:04 PM] kynadre#0000
@evov still buying lots of AL?


[02-Oct-24 05:06 PM] kynadre#0000
remember also, PRUNplanner can help you figure this out, and you can put in the inventory column what you already have (like from faction contracts)

[02-Oct-24 05:06 PM] ibumcuckets#0000
If i havent missed something extractors produce about 14 units of ALO every 15 hours while smelters turn 6 ALO into 3 AL every 11 hours, so It wont be 100% efficient but it seems better to go for extra SME over another extractor.

I'm sure, but it should be considered


[02-Oct-24 05:09 PM] kynadre#0000
185 AL or 370 ALO max him out, or like, 92 AL while still having room for like 180 ALO

Negative as in a loss on the shipment trip as a whole but honestly I was just in my head about making profit on the first shipment but I realized you gotta spend money to make money. After i pump up the AL production i'll just recoup the losses on the next shipments.

{Reactions}
👍 🫂 🤔 

[03-Oct-24 10:05 AM] kynadre#0000
The math is both scary and exciting when you realize what it costs to expand the base a bit, realize you can afford it, then realize how much more it costs for inputs for your production and increased workers... then it's exciting when you see how much more you're making on the end of it 😄


[03-Oct-24 10:18 AM] ibumcuckets#0000
Any specific reason Prunplaner shows extractor as producing 15 ALO as opposed to the 14 ALO its actually producing in game?


[03-Oct-24 10:18 AM] jcheung#0000
it's messed up on extractors, but the time is also offset so the daily output is correct

{Reactions}

i did ^^


[07-Oct-24 10:32 AM] meticulous_fgc#0000
Thanks for the invite. I don't know much about Discord but my current username/ ID is part of another game that I play and has a server on Discord. Will changing it on here alter my username on that server? I got started on PU after seeing my brother playing it. It looked interesting and different. Now my wife has started to show an interest as well and is considering starting at the weekend. As for goals, I don't really have any. Just read the starter stuff in the tutorials, picked a faction,  chose a starting profession (Metallurgist), chose a planet ( Antares II-Deimos), and just started from there.


[07-Oct-24 10:34 AM] jvaler#0000
i can't find you ingame with either `CO FGC` or `USR Meticulous`...


[07-Oct-24 10:35 AM] jvaler#0000
if you click `SDBR` at the top left, then click your company name at the top right, what is your CO code?

I did see at least two Russian names in the game yesterday, the "joined" messages, so there are people taking a look. I mean, no telling whether they're fluent in English or what language they speak primarily, but they appeared to use naming convention many Russian players do in Eve to approximate RU writing with English characters

Haven't decided if branching into manufacturing yet is a good idea, but that'll most likely be down the road. Personally looking for what others have done to find a strategy going forward.

I‘m also located on Deimos. I‘m not sure if i should also invest into AL, b/c it seems thats what everybody is doing. Prunplanner tells me a EXT/SME for AL will break even in just about 18d, but i feel AL might be a bit crowded, given Deimos is starter planet with ALO… so i‘m not sure what to do, yet. 😁 C seems an interesting option rn…


[09-Oct-24 04:37 PM] getonthetrain#0000
no worries for expanding AL, it's used in too many common recipes that the demand is never ending

Heya! I'm located mostly in the ANT region and on almost every pure H2O planet. My main goal in the game is supplying the Antares CX with reasonably affordable :H2O: while also attempting to provide the Moria CX with a decent amount of it as well. 

I'm not currently looking for anything specific in ADI, I just figured it couldn't hurt joining the server to have another place to read up on what's going on in the sector and to potentially be able to help out where possible ✌️

Hello, I am a new player currently working on my first base on Harmonia, my brother has been playing this for a while and said that I should check out this discord for more specific information about planning bases and what is most profitable in this area, as he is in Benten.

Hello, Joe Biden here. My company resides outside the central CX's but interacts with all markets, the HQ resides on AW-066e. All territories with properties by Czarina Corp resides in sectors CC, AW, and HV. My primary goal is to develop engines of ships and the engines of infrastructure in the outskirts to bring about higher populations on many outskirt planets. My interest in ADI is to seek others who may wish to work to develop the outskirts not to be profiteers but pioneers.

from the looks of it, if i understand correctly, you're setting up near HRT with....
a GL? planet / water extraction
H mining (food industries)
looks like maybe HE or BRM extraction (yields look a little low to me)
another food industries planet

He's got my stamp of approval. He went along the road #less-taken, and has remained with Prun so far... 

His planets are actually... (giggles)... Decent prospects for development...

He's out-of-range for most of ADI... But I'll take it upon myself to throw quite a bit of capital injection his way, with 2k t/m3 support, along with potentially other perks if @the_czarina pokes me in-game.

[28-Oct-24 07:05 PM] tnt_78#0000
Im just start this game yesterday, so I very slowly collect informations from you tube etc, how to play. I am carboon farmer, have my 2 farms, 2 piioner hab and Incinerator. Now, I think what next. Probably good plan is buy components to build Rig for water, extraction and Food processor? Yeah, I ask about some start tips, if you can giv me any. Game is complicated for newb. I like to build a self-sufficient colony earning its own living if this is possible ;p


[28-Oct-24 07:07 PM] getonthetrain#0000
carbon is so useful that you could build that into any direction


[28-Oct-24 07:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
Smelting is a bit loaded on people but still good / Carbon always nice / RATs ( simple rations ) good money maker but takes a bit of money to set up / Chems are always in demand


[28-Oct-24 07:08 PM] igfloz#0000
I'd be wary of adding H20 extraction and C production to the same base. Both of those will benefit from bonuses offered on other planets


[28-Oct-24 07:10 PM] jvaler#0000
on harmonia, it's better to just build more FRMs than to add RIGs


[28-Oct-24 07:18 PM] tanda#0000
honestly right now RIGS are an income boost over a deficit


[28-Oct-24 07:18 PM] tnt_78#0000
So I should just buy water and things needed by the colonists at the station, bring it by ship to my base, and sell my product ( carbon ) ?  Should I set up more incinerators? Currently I have one, but the production from two farms provides more plants than the incinerator processes.


[28-Oct-24 07:18 PM] tanda#0000
but it's not going to stay that way

Welcome Hunter! Great to see you here 🥳
The game can be intimidating at first, but you will get the hang out of it. Gladly, the game is slow moving. So you’ll have enough time to catch up 😉

Antares is known for their ore smelting capabilities. Since C is needed for that, you’ll definitely get your C to the people. 

There’re many different ways to play - everybody has his own opinion of “what’s the best”, but most people agree on concentrating the production of one or two products per planet. Also, you don’t have to produce everything by yourself. Some markets are well stocked and relatively stable (for example H2O), and therefore you can rely on buying a stable supply from the CX. 

Best goal for the beginning is to fill up all the space of your starting planet, so you have at least one base producing some money for you. After that, you’ll have to decide what direction your company should go.

There’s a grant program, which can help you with getting started, too. They also will help you to understand what criteria are important when expanding and what’s not. More information in #agp-information

Thank you for everything. I'm getting acquainted with PRUNplanner, and slowly getting used to the game's interface. I hope that I will sort everything out somehow, although at the beginning the economics of production costs, maintaining the needs of the colonists and fuel costs in relation to the production value are simply terrifying and raise the specter of bankruptcy 😄

By now have bases on Deimos (start), Agamemnon, Vulcan, Harmonia, Nike and Ice Station. Building slowly up with organic growth principles, vertical integration, optimizing for low production/POP costs and thus maximizing profit per production tick. 

My short term goal is to squeeze out my first GEN based STL ship to free up the start ships for reliable and regular hauling between my focus systems. The long term goal is to compete on ship manufacturing. 

In ADI I am looking for news, insights, do's & don'ts, shipping services, trends, giggles and business partners

Hi all! I'm located in Antares I - Phobos. Relatively new to the game, starting as a carbon farmer and just got PRO. Short term goal is just to expand a bit more, either deciding on something else to make, or just ramping up carbon production. Longer term I'm still trying to figure out.

Looking for news, information or general chat about the Antares system, grants to help expand, and see if there's any opportunities to contribute to system development.

Welcome, @umbers 🥳

Carbon is in high demand right now, so you did a good choice there 🙂

Welcome


[05-Nov-24 04:33 AM] umbers#0000
Thanks! Yeah, rushed what I had to the CX yesterday after I checked the chart😄  Really helped nearly fill up my first permit, so currently trying to figure out what my next best step is.


[05-Nov-24 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
well


[05-Nov-24 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
First you finish your first base


[05-Nov-24 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
then you finish your second base


[05-Nov-24 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
then, you finish your third base


[05-Nov-24 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000

[05-Nov-24 12:46 PM] jcheung#0000
phobos isn't really ideal for carbon or farming due to its COCG alignment


[05-Nov-24 12:47 PM] jcheung#0000
how invested are you into phobos?


[05-Nov-24 12:48 PM] jcheung#0000
if not too invested, a COLIQ may not be a bad idea-if you liquidate your assets i'm sure one of us would be more than happy to transfer to your new company
if you really want to stay there, i strongly suggest considering applying for AGP for a different planet


[05-Nov-24 03:17 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you already got a grant, the price of moving bases isn't too high. If you haven't yet, you can use it on a different planet too. I think technically saving assets across a COLIQ is a no-no. So we can make it work without that.


[05-Nov-24 03:25 PM] jcheung#0000
they just joined, so i don't think they've gotten one

(also wasn't aware of saving being a no-no)


[05-Nov-24 03:34 PM] laaxus#0000
it is against tos


[05-Nov-24 03:34 PM] laaxus#0000
(99% sure)


[05-Nov-24 03:38 PM] jcheung#0000
i don't see any mention of it in ToS


[05-Nov-24 03:39 PM] laaxus#0000
When I started a new account, it was explicit I was not allowed to transfer things from a newly created account to another


[05-Nov-24 03:40 PM] igfloz#0000
👆  I think thats a totally different thing from COLIQ. If you COILIQ, you are still using the same account (email / password)


[05-Nov-24 03:41 PM] igfloz#0000
...you are only re-starting your  errr.... "company" ??


[05-Nov-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
additionally it could be considered two gifts. one gift from the liquidating player to someone, and then a starting gift from someone to the freshly liquidated player


[05-Nov-24 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
as there is no third party finances involved, it does not violate 3.7 of the ToS


[05-Nov-24 03:43 PM] jcheung#0000
ingame transfers between players are explicitly permitted

Sending the free money and materials you get as a new company to others and then COLIQing is a no go, but the things you made  or gathered is fine

[05-Nov-24 04:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think the egregious rule breaking is sending everything to a friend, including starting materials, then COLIQing to get another copy of it. Which isn't really the case here, and everyone is pretty reasonable in general about such things. But best to follow the letter of the rule 🤷‍♂️


[05-Nov-24 04:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
And it's not awful to experiment on Phobos with whatever weird combo you want to do. It seems most people start that way


[05-Nov-24 04:16 PM] jcheung#0000
you are not buying or selling at an unusual price


[06-Nov-24 02:05 AM] umbers#0000
I don't think I'll COLIQ at this point. I was just going to apply for the grant and set up on another planet, then probably replace what I have on Phobos over time.

Feels like Phobos isn't really ideal for any starter profession with it's COCG? But the profit on C seemed respectable enough at the moment without that bonus.

Nice. I also started on Phobos and used the grant money to get out of there. Recently came back to start electronics. Really, any lack of extra efficiency doesn't matter too much in the PIO and SET tiers as they don't cost a lot to function.


[06-Nov-24 08:21 AM] getonthetrain#0000
I wouldn't COLIQ either


[06-Nov-24 04:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But what constitutes an unusual price there? Bear with me, briefly...

CX orders are fairly well evidenced, and can easily be construed as item, or liquidity deletion, given the COLIQ circumstances....

But that if you've played for so long in region A..... and would rather prefer to move to region B.... Given the current game environment, you'd be forced to COLIQ, just to get a starter plot on a locked-out planet, with better peripheral FTL links, to other places that interest you.....

If you COLIQ there, you delete your ships and your HQ level... but what about your stockpiles.... Can your legally transfer them via current rules?


[06-Nov-24 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
So if you sell someone 1 DW for 1 million AIC so you can preserve your cash, that's an unusual transaction.


[06-Nov-24 04:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you sell 100 IDC for 1 AIC, so you can preserve your IDC across COLIQs, that's an unusual transaction


[06-Nov-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
if you sell your 100 IDC for 1,530,000 AIC, then COLIQ and all the AIC is destroyed, that's not an unusual transaction, so that's permitted.


[06-Nov-24 04:49 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's what the rules are trying to get to.


[06-Nov-24 04:54 PM] igfloz#0000
I feel that the whole COLIQ conversation can be construed as people trying to "game the game" - just play the game. If the dev's haven't covered any "game the game" instances, or at least made them difficult for a new player to attain, then that's on them. The whole COLIQ and keep your $$ is covered in the T&C, you should abide by them


[06-Nov-24 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
No


[06-Nov-24 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
That line in there looks to be to stop people from say


[06-Nov-24 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Spending 100m buying out all the DW and RAT on all the markets


[06-Nov-24 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
And then COLIQ


[06-Nov-24 06:14 PM] jcheung#0000
There is nothing prohibiting large gifts


[06-Nov-24 06:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm... There is just one... teeny, tiny setence in Article 3 Section 7, of the simulogics Terms of Service, which governs PRUN, which in contention, per my opinion:

```3.7 The user is not permitted to sell, rent, or transfer their account, virtual currency balance, premium features or any other virtual game items to a third party or to transcribe those things to someone else’s name. This does not include free trading options built into the games. Correspondingly, all parties obligate themselves to not transfer any rights, requests or claims arising from the contractual relationship to third parties (§ 399 BGB). This also includes services which concern reaching goals in a game, the purchase of virtual items or other advantages in a game for real money.
```

The sentence of question being :  ** This does not include free trading options built into the games. **.


[06-Nov-24 07:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Essentially, if all parties involved: [1) have been, 2) are, and 3) only will be involved], in the provided mechanics of play, and methods of exchange (you all know of the loans, transfers, et.c. in-game, and only in-game, for in-game benefits)... And no one is involved in RMT transactions, or out-of-game benefits... Then it's all permissible, i.e. non-actionable by devs or anyone else.....

**What happens in PRUN, stays in PRUN?** Idk. You'd best be able to provide your own evidence, btw.


[06-Nov-24 07:12 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If Archiel, and jcheung9941.... decide to trade 100k IDC for 1 AIC.... at one date... and vice versa..... 1 AIC for 100k IDC at another date.... With no out-of-game implications, or contracts or whatever.....  being a completely #free-trade arrangement, for some in-game purpose, devoid of any RL gain... Should it be fair?


[06-Nov-24 08:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ Sorry, but most of the PRUN terms are in #legal-speak. I did my best to cut it, or explain it, in simple terms. 

This is just an exercise.... Not to point out who's dumber... But to point out that PRUN's rules and ToS are basically unclear to most people.


[06-Nov-24 08:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's a lot of "grey" area that's possible, with the devs own terms.

oh ok, i'd like to be a trader but i also read that is not very good, is better to build industry and stuff but yea i guess is better if i try it and then restart


[09-Nov-24 03:54 AM] laaxus#0000
to trade, you need capital


[09-Nov-24 03:54 AM] laaxus#0000
and you don't have any


[09-Nov-24 03:55 AM] guillejejexdd#0000
yea well i mean later on when i have money


[09-Nov-24 03:55 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, you need to build bases as it generates money and capital


[09-Nov-24 03:56 AM] laaxus#0000
you're free to use that capital later on to trade


[09-Nov-24 03:56 AM] guillejejexdd#0000

another possibility is just to destroy and move out : nothing stop you from doing that

COLIQ is the wisest action for moving off of Phobos early. Then you can drop on Deimos


[11-Nov-24 09:52 AM] laaxus#0000
I originally started on Phobos


[11-Nov-24 09:52 AM] laaxus#0000
then I coliqed and started on deimos


[11-Nov-24 09:52 AM] laaxus#0000
but honestly, that's ok


[11-Nov-24 09:52 AM] laaxus#0000
stay on phobos


[11-Nov-24 09:53 AM] laaxus#0000
You'll know by yourself if you want to move or not

Hey Quiet, great you found you way here. And also a hearty welcome to all new members ^^

All important information about how this Discord server is structured and organised is found in #server-information.

If you have any questions about the game, feel free to ask in #associate-office or #member-general. Or use the search function (CTRL+ F) to find answers to often asked questions.

When you're ready, you might want to look into the #agp-information to apply for a grant, which helps massively through the early-game-grind. Take a look at already approved applications to get a sense for what is important and profitable.

Yeah I love the game, like I said.


[13-Nov-24 09:33 AM] jcheung#0000
Anyways. I suggest considering moving to more chemestry products on montem, as you have a 25% boost there


[13-Nov-24 09:33 AM] jcheung#0000
Shorthand COGC, for chamber of global commerce


[13-Nov-24 09:34 AM] jcheung#0000
But you don't have to shift now


[13-Nov-24 09:34 AM] jcheung#0000
What's your future plans?


[13-Nov-24 09:35 AM] tyrandia#0000
I plan on running my corp with my friend, getting established in NEO and Antares space, me making metals and such and my friend doing food and carbon.


[13-Nov-24 09:36 AM] jcheung#0000
Well, when you end up coming down to ANT you can check out #agp-information


[13-Nov-24 09:36 AM] tyrandia#0000
Well I'd be interested in sending a ship now if it means a grant honestly...


[13-Nov-24 09:37 AM] jcheung#0000
My main concern with you doing that, is that's opposite sides of the galaxy


[13-Nov-24 09:37 AM] jcheung#0000
You're going to end up splitting your ships fulltime-which is doable for sure


[13-Nov-24 09:38 AM] jcheung#0000
But i just want to make sure that you look over your plans and make sure that you can handle things with only one ship at each area


[13-Nov-24 09:38 AM] jcheung#0000
Transit time is like 2 days between MOR and ANT


[13-Nov-24 09:39 AM] tyrandia#0000
Gotcha.


[13-Nov-24 09:40 AM] tyrandia#0000
Luckily Montem is right by the station, like literally 3h travel on a decentish burn


[13-Nov-24 09:40 AM] jcheung#0000
Yeah.
I will say that chemistry is a very profitable line, generally


[13-Nov-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
So montem is pretty decent


[13-Nov-24 09:41 AM] tyrandia#0000
Montem also has a decent Metal bonus


[13-Nov-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
You can also consider some loans too


[13-Nov-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
It doesn't


[13-Nov-24 09:41 AM] jcheung#0000
The COGC is chemistry, not metallurgy


[13-Nov-24 09:41 AM] tyrandia#0000
I actually don't know how to look at loans


[13-Nov-24 09:43 AM] tyrandia#0000
OH, well the planet has a base 6% to metallurgy I saw on my base, but I do see the Chamber is pushing chemical production


[13-Nov-24 09:44 AM] jcheung#0000

Understood.


[13-Nov-24 09:49 AM] laaxus#0000
This game is a sandbox, your primary goal should be to have fun


[13-Nov-24 09:49 AM] laaxus#0000
There's a guy that only pump water, and basically give half the universe supply of h2o, at low price

✌️ 

[13-Nov-24 09:49 AM] laaxus#0000
There's another guy that found his fun mainly to be extracting rocks


[13-Nov-24 09:50 AM] laaxus#0000
another that prefered the trading aspect


[13-Nov-24 09:50 AM] laaxus#0000
There are shipbuilders, governors

I want to build ships honestly.


[13-Nov-24 09:50 AM] jcheung#0000
Well. I'm sure there's also some guys too


[13-Nov-24 09:50 AM] tyrandia#0000
Some girls just gotta build.


[13-Nov-24 09:50 AM] laaxus#0000
There are people that prefer low risk mid reward, other that prefer high risk high reward


[13-Nov-24 09:51 AM] jcheung#0000
It's a good long term goal, the current shipbuilders I've talked to say they took like a year to two years to get into a comfortable position


[13-Nov-24 09:51 AM] tyrandia#0000

[13-Nov-24 09:58 AM] jcheung#0000
Needs a bit of work, and the shipping is, uhm


[13-Nov-24 09:58 AM] jcheung#0000
I don't want to discourage you, but youre not going to be able to handle a full base with one starter


[13-Nov-24 09:59 AM] tyrandia#0000
I was going to take a loan out as well and use that to supply the base.


[13-Nov-24 09:59 AM] jcheung#0000
🌊


[13-Nov-24 09:59 AM] jcheung#0000
I wouldn't recommend fuel to be an early base


[13-Nov-24 10:00 AM] jcheung#0000
But if you really want


[13-Nov-24 10:00 AM] tyrandia#0000
What would you recommend then?


[13-Nov-24 10:00 AM] jcheung#0000
I can look a good spot for you, or you can look yourself


[13-Nov-24 10:00 AM] tyrandia#0000
I'll take a look see.


[13-Nov-24 10:01 AM] laaxus#0000
Fuel isn't the most profitable nor the easier tbh


[13-Nov-24 10:02 AM] laaxus#0000
(in antares)


[13-Nov-24 10:02 AM] tyrandia#0000
Wasn't quite looking into profit as a 'Can this get my ships around for me'


[13-Nov-24 10:02 AM] laaxus#0000
Fuel is very cheap, except for starter player


[13-Nov-24 10:03 AM] laaxus#0000
once you get to 2-3 bases, fuel is a footnote


[13-Nov-24 10:03 AM] tyrandia#0000
Got it.


[13-Nov-24 10:03 AM] jcheung#0000
Hey, laax can you check if deimos has any slots open?


[13-Nov-24 10:03 AM] laaxus#0000
2s


[13-Nov-24 10:03 AM] laaxus#0000
+4


[13-Nov-24 10:04 AM] jcheung#0000
+4 as in 4 over? Darn.
Metallurgy on deimos may be an option for you, if slots open up there in the near future


[13-Nov-24 10:04 AM] laaxus#0000
should we move to #associate-office ?


[13-Nov-24 10:04 AM] jcheung#0000
Close to CX and while shipping intense, is also manageable with one starter

expert generation scales with the size of the base. Given a half full or 75% full base, experts will accumulate much more quickly


[23-Nov-24 10:31 PM] tanda#0000
Well, ADI offers the grant to new players interested in expanding into Antares space. We have a few people who have received the grant who still operate a base in MOR space as well as in ANT

im only a week and half in, for that kind of start up capital , ill restart

Have you familiarized yourself with Prun planner yet? It helps a lot for planning out base expansions

[25-Nov-24 09:17 PM] iwooden#0000
Hi! Think I finally got everything set up - old EVE player but brand new to PrUn, went for Metallurgist on Deimos, currently clicking around PRUNPlanner and wondering if I should COLIQ lol. Eventually I'd like to scale up, maybe start making my own carbon, some of the stuff out of the FS building looks profitable with at least some trading volume behind it?... but mostly just figuring out the APEX interface and picking up basic consumables for now.


[25-Nov-24 09:18 PM] archielvahr#0000
Welcome! Deimos is a good planet, especially since it's been full lately

what makes you want to COLIQ?


[25-Nov-24 09:20 PM] jcheung#0000
what would you do instead?


[25-Nov-24 09:22 PM] iwooden#0000
Eh, maybe Victualler or whatever the farmer start is, FOD looks pretty profitable, but who knows - I've only been at this for like 20 minutes 😅


[25-Nov-24 09:23 PM] iwooden#0000
Farmer start seems universally recommended in the new player guides I've found but I suspected it'd be a bit crowded/lots of oversupply


[25-Nov-24 09:24 PM] jcheung#0000
i would say spend at least a couple days messing around before doing the COLIQ if you're set on it


[25-Nov-24 09:24 PM] iwooden#0000
Ye that's the plan


[25-Nov-24 09:25 PM] jcheung#0000
FOD looks profitable, but... there's been a total of 43 units traded this week. are you looking at selling to bids, or setting an ask?


[25-Nov-24 09:26 PM] jcheung#0000
because if you're using ask then you might be waiting a long time to sell that FOD


[25-Nov-24 09:41 PM] iwooden#0000
Oh, I thought it had more volume than that


[26-Nov-24 03:27 AM] jvaler#0000
CXPC "volume" is amount * price, you wanna look at "traded" on the left of CXPC

@bluesnakelw 👋


[04-Dec-24 06:53 AM] bluesnakelw#0000
Hi, I started the game about a month ago as a victualler on Harmonia but went more in the direction of a Carbon Farmer. I am still just figuring things out and not sure in how my company is gonna evolve. I joined the server to meet new people on the game and maybe get some tips and tricks to start.

"Hi! I've been playing this game for a couple of days now. I've been learning the basics and would like to keep engaging with the communities within the game. At the same time, I want to continue learning and having fun. I want to specialize in food production. I already have some farms, and I’d like to join the corporation to further develop myself."


[06-Dec-24 06:12 PM] jvaler#0000
is this ai generated?


[06-Dec-24 06:42 PM] mrdetan#0000
Yes, I don't know much English. I understand it well, but I'm bad at writing it.


[06-Dec-24 07:15 PM] jvaler#0000
you understand it well, meaning you can double check the output of the ai? i don't want misunderstandings to come up due to the ai speaking for you


[06-Dec-24 07:18 PM] mrdetan#0000
Oh, don't worry, my problem is more with grammar rules and those kinds of things. But I understand English perfectly. Of course, I understand what the AI gives me, and I'm sure there won't be any misunderstandings.


[06-Dec-24 07:21 PM] jvaler#0000
alright, i've roled you. welcome to ADI =)


[06-Dec-24 07:21 PM] mrdetan#0000
Thank you very much! I'm ready to participate. What do you recommend I do first?


[06-Dec-24 07:34 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't know, i'd need to know what you want to do. all you've really said is that you want to do food production.

i can see you're on promitor, so if you don't want to COLIQ for the ₳1,000,000 AGP grant in antares, you'll just want to keep building FRMs. last i checked it's viable to also build FP on promitor in the short-term until you get a second base on avalon for it's +25% food industries COGC bonus.

It's amazing how many people join and never make it past the airlock because they don't even want to introduce themselves


[21-Dec-24 07:06 PM] tanda#0000
This is part of why I advocated the glass fishbowl method of the server, but still. How many have joined for the grant and never gotten it due to being shy


[21-Dec-24 07:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean


[21-Dec-24 07:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
They can’t even do that much for free money then…. Do they really deserve getting it?


[21-Dec-24 07:22 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Probably


[21-Dec-24 07:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If shyness is the issue it's hard to blame a person for feeling uncomfortable


[21-Dec-24 07:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think the fish bowl thing would work


[21-Dec-24 07:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We don't do that rn right ?


[21-Dec-24 07:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
No I don’t think we do a fishbowl rn


[21-Dec-24 07:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000

@histidinedwarf @realharvey we do the fishbowl thing rn, we voted on it a while back https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1248855462208868372/1271896286592897138


[21-Dec-24 08:49 PM] jvaler#0000
they can see basically everything except for staff chat, bot log, and member chat(while it was still in use)


[21-Dec-24 08:50 PM] jvaler#0000
ah shit PSK is hidden from them


[21-Dec-24 08:51 PM] jvaler#0000
fixed


[22-Dec-24 05:11 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I was definately able to see but not post in most/all of the channels I can see now as a member (associate?).

However, as I mentioned to jvaler, I did miss the "introduce yourself" bit since many discords have a bot run the "airlock" so its more about, like, making sure your name is the right format and what roles you want.

I don't know if other people also glaze past that (but I don't know how they'd miss the need to ping someone, and I can't imagine someone joins for the grant but doesn't expect to/is to shy to at least say "I want a grant")

For my own blindness, if the steps were a bullet list instead of a paragraph, that'd have helped 🙂


[22-Dec-24 06:02 AM] realharvey#0000
You don't need to ping someone usually.


[22-Dec-24 06:02 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Ok, it's listed as one of the steps though (and it was how I found out I missed the first step) 🙂


[22-Dec-24 06:29 AM] realharvey#0000
Yeah that's true. But in 9/10 times the staff is quicker than anyone can ping :D


[22-Dec-24 06:29 AM] realharvey#0000
Anyone that writes a message here gets usually onboarded pretty fast


[22-Dec-24 06:30 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
And, of course, I interpreted "ping" as "send a DM" 🙂

DW and RAT


[04-Jan-25 08:03 AM] jcheung#0000
both are sorely needed right now


[04-Jan-25 08:04 AM] freeloader4#0000
thats great to know cause i randomly picked a profession and planet lol


[04-Jan-25 08:05 AM] laaxus#0000
it might be pure luck, but great choice lol


[04-Jan-25 08:05 AM] jcheung#0000
i will say though, phobos COGC isn't ideal for that


[04-Jan-25 08:05 AM] jcheung#0000
but the profit margin on them is high enough that it's still worth it, at least for DW


[04-Jan-25 08:05 AM] jcheung#0000
RAT i haven't looked closely enough


[04-Jan-25 08:05 AM] laaxus#0000
yes this ^
however, we're so in need of DW and RAT that it is still very very profitable as it is


[04-Jan-25 08:06 AM] laaxus#0000
Phobos is arguably the worst starter planet in antares
However, producing DW makes it one of the best atm

Hi


[08-Jan-25 12:03 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
is there anything else I need to do ?


[08-Jan-25 12:04 AM] finestone#0000
dont think so just wait for someone to roll you


[08-Jan-25 12:04 AM] finestone#0000
you should be able to look around still 🙂


[08-Jan-25 12:04 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok I'll just wait, thx


[08-Jan-25 12:05 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
is it true that new players get 1 mil loan at start ? I mean that's a extremely huge jumpstart


[08-Jan-25 12:06 AM] finestone#0000
great community here highly recommend! make sure to check out prunplanner and yes we offer 1M grants for the ANT newbros 🙂


[08-Jan-25 12:06 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
I think I'm already able to use basic functions of prunplanner, great website tool


[08-Jan-25 12:07 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
that's unbelievable


[08-Jan-25 12:07 AM] finestone#0000
awesome to hear! essentially all a grant person is looking for is that you understand how the market works and to show us you have a plan 🙂


[08-Jan-25 12:08 AM] finestone#0000
do you have industry/planet/plan yet?


[08-Jan-25 12:08 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
you mean paper plan or I need to finish it on prunplanner ?


[08-Jan-25 12:09 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
actually I didn't expect a 1mil jumpstart fund so currently only short-term plans in my mind


[08-Jan-25 12:09 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
but seems like I need to re-think my indy roadmap


[08-Jan-25 12:12 AM] finestone#0000
you dont *have* to build it in prun planner but there is a share function so makes it easier you also dont need to spend the full one Mil on a base as youll want some buffer for consumables fuel etc. but yes we would like to see the base you are planning and what you will be selling to make sure it will set you up for success


[08-Jan-25 12:13 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
ok got it, I'll do it on prunplanner now


[08-Jan-25 12:13 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
should take some time


[08-Jan-25 12:13 AM] finestone#0000
Sounds good are you aware of how COGC works?


[08-Jan-25 12:14 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
not so much, just know it will bring buffer to corresponding industry


[08-Jan-25 12:14 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
deimos is currently good for metallurgist 🙂


[08-Jan-25 12:16 AM] finestone#0000
so COGC gives 25% boost to a specific industry for entire planet. Generally everyone plans thier bases around these so they *wont* change.


[08-Jan-25 12:17 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so COGC bonus won't disappear after time ?


[08-Jan-25 12:17 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
great


[08-Jan-25 12:17 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000

as long as the COGC is filled with upkeep (usually done by the GOV) then yes always on


[08-Jan-25 12:20 AM] finestone#0000
are you aware you need pro for the grant?


[08-Jan-25 12:20 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000

[08-Jan-25 12:21 AM] finestone#0000

[08-Jan-25 12:28 AM] jvaler#0000
do for what?


[08-Jan-25 12:28 AM] jvaler#0000
are you applying for the AGP grant?


[08-Jan-25 12:29 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
yeah the grant and how to join the corp in-game ?


[08-Jan-25 12:29 AM] jvaler#0000
corp in-game only exists to provide +10% efficiency to #ppp-information


[08-Jan-25 12:29 AM] jvaler#0000
they have no other useful functionality aside from that


[08-Jan-25 12:30 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
so I needn't to really join a corp in-game


[08-Jan-25 12:30 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000

@jvaler How's it going, do I need to get roled or is that taken care of by the server onboarding?


[10-Jan-25 02:51 PM] wikifeia#0000
I'm located at Deimos, I'm currently building up my resource extraction/smelting facilities, but eventually I want to settle on Nike and start manufacturing BSE and Flux with the extracted limestone and shipped aluminum. Stretch goal is to eventually also settle on Harmonia and supply both other bases with carbon, food, and water, though that's far in the future.


[10-Jan-25 02:54 PM] wikifeia#0000
Still playing around with prunplanner. I'm not sure if it's more efficient to go all in on extraction and smelting or to also have a handful of collectors so that I don't need to buy oxygen.

Hey,
I'm Salty X, located in Antares, happy client of AGP program.
Took a short break from a game but now dusting off my smelters on Deimos.
Rather new player.

My goals are undecided at this point. Looking to get to routine going again and take it from there. 
Possible looking to optimize my production or branch into other venues. Upgrading one of my ships is up there on the list.

Up for long term partnership if anyone's interested in buying AL or want to sell C or ALO. 

Glad to be here.

Hello, I've been here a few weeks, but feel like I don't really know what's going on as I barely keep my head above water financially. My goal is just to figure out PrUn and have fun. I'm not quite sure what is meant by in-game location. My main base is at Antares II - Deimos ZV-759c if that's right. In any case, thanks for letting me be here! Also, how do I find my Company ID? My company name is "TreepunchingInc" but it's unclear how to get the ID tag.

Hey! I was on Vallis but decided to restart and take advantage of the grant and moving to Antares 😛 I was just looking over the starter guide to decide where abouts I should start. 😄


[31-Jan-25 04:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So you didn’t COLIQ yet?


[31-Jan-25 04:52 AM] cactu55#0000
I just did lol

[31-Jan-25 04:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Where did you settle?


[31-Jan-25 04:54 AM] cactu55#0000
Just now? I guess I'm a little confused, the guide says Hephaestus is a good option but I can't start there?


[31-Jan-25 04:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sadly, no. Hephaestus is not a starter planet


[31-Jan-25 04:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You can choose between Deimos (Metalurgy), Phobos (Electronics) and Harmonia (Agriculture)


[31-Jan-25 04:56 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Deimos is good for AL (most of starter are going that route). AL is not particularly profitable, tho it’s currently around 60k/day or so


[31-Jan-25 04:57 AM] cactu55#0000
I guess Metallurgy is probably my best bet then


[31-Jan-25 04:57 AM] cactu55#0000
Hmmm


[31-Jan-25 04:57 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Harmonia could be good for C or HER, tho HER just got a big hit with the DDT being completely bought out


[31-Jan-25 04:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And C prices are really stable since the last crisis end of last year


[31-Jan-25 04:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I would suggest to play with a few base designs in PrunPlanner, before settling for any particular spot


[31-Jan-25 04:59 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could even discuss it in the #agp-operations channel


[31-Jan-25 05:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
As soon as a moderator roles you


[31-Jan-25 05:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
@all, is there anything we’re lacking on the market, that’s beginner friendly?


[31-Jan-25 05:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I know AL and C will always sell


[31-Jan-25 05:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
DW, RAT and COF might need another COGC to be really profitable


[31-Jan-25 05:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
HER seems to be a hype and not long-term sustainable


[31-Jan-25 05:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
bfabs have low profit margins


[31-Jan-25 05:09 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could think about starting on Deimos and move the permit more or less immediately to Hephaestus (or any other planet), if you have a good idea for it. Just post a plan into AGP as soon as you can. If you get the grant, you should be able to settle on another planet. I can help you to move the pfabs, if needed.

I wouldn't even know how to do that, but would very much appreciate the help!


[31-Jan-25 05:12 AM] laaxus#0000
if you take pro, I could give you DDT for HER production


[31-Jan-25 05:12 AM] laaxus#0000
I have largely enough on harmonia


[31-Jan-25 05:12 AM] cactu55#0000
While extremely generous, I'd prefer to import/produce the inputs myself.


[31-Jan-25 05:13 AM] laaxus#0000
I could sell it to you at historic price


[31-Jan-25 05:13 AM] laaxus#0000
if you prefer that


[31-Jan-25 05:14 AM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend a FRM base

[31-Jan-25 05:14 AM] laaxus#0000
Very high ROI


[31-Jan-25 05:14 AM] laaxus#0000
very low shipping


[31-Jan-25 05:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
@cactu55 do you know how to use PrunPlanner?


[31-Jan-25 05:15 AM] cactu55#0000
Interesting...


[31-Jan-25 05:15 AM] cactu55#0000
Yep! Been looking at various starter bases

[31-Jan-25 05:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You could ride the HER train as long it’s that profitable


[31-Jan-25 05:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And switch to food processing or carbon burning down the line, if you want


[31-Jan-25 05:20 AM] pxlfox.#0000
PP says over 100k a day? You can’t argue with that


[31-Jan-25 05:21 AM] laaxus#0000
100k a day for a HER base is RIDICULOUS


[31-Jan-25 05:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It is 😂


[31-Jan-25 05:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That’s why I’m saying, I’m not sure how long it will stay like that


[31-Jan-25 05:22 AM] realharvey#0000
HER atleast needs DDT which is a more advanced chemical MAT


[31-Jan-25 05:23 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And DDT just got bought out of the market, probably to rise its price


[31-Jan-25 05:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Or to gatekeep HER for a while


[31-Jan-25 05:39 AM] cactu55#0000
I think HER might be what I go for


[31-Jan-25 05:39 AM] cactu55#0000
In which case @laaxus I would take the DDT offer 😛


[31-Jan-25 05:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I can only sell it to you if you have pro


[31-Jan-25 05:40 AM] cactu55#0000
Was planning on upgrading for the grant anyways


[31-Jan-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
with the grant, you could build a full base at once


[31-Jan-25 05:43 AM] cactu55#0000
Full being 500/500 area used?

[31-Jan-25 05:44 AM] jvaler#0000

[31-Jan-25 06:03 AM] realharvey#0000
I'd suggest adding 1 STO to your plan.


[31-Jan-25 06:04 AM] cactu55#0000
What does an STO do?


[31-Jan-25 06:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
More storage


[31-Jan-25 06:04 AM] cactu55#0000
Ahh, makes sense!


[31-Jan-25 06:05 AM] realharvey#0000
It's not really needed if you just do HER. But if you start to create other FRM products your storage will be full pretty quickly (7 Days)


[31-Jan-25 06:06 AM] cactu55#0000
Sweet, appreciate it!


[31-Jan-25 06:07 AM] jvaler#0000

Technicians and engineers to be added very soon, revenue is starting to grow and would love to add to my ship fleet as soon as I can but seems a while off yet

That is right, the ADI offers a 1M grant to develop the Antares faction


[11-Feb-25 12:38 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
and its a grant, not loan 🙂


[11-Feb-25 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000
However, you need pro or basic to get it


[11-Feb-25 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000
I gave you the associate role


[11-Feb-25 12:39 PM] laaxus#0000
You'll get the member rôle once you have a base in antares


[11-Feb-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
Meanwhile, I recommend Reading through #channel-information


[11-Feb-25 12:40 PM] laaxus#0000
As for the grant, you should take a look at #agp-information #agp-operations


[11-Feb-25 12:41 PM] laaxus#0000
The ADI offers much more than the grant 🙂

Roh left the server, they were invited by Unknown.


[11-Feb-25 09:10 PM] jvaler#0000
for transparency, i've kicked roh for blocking multiple staff members. we need to be able to contact people if we want to moderate a server.
this was the kick message: 
```Blocking multiple staff members leaves us with no way to contact you. For us to be able to moderate the server properly we need to be able to conduct conflict resolution, and that isn't possible if all the staff are blocked by you. 

You can rejoin ADI if you ever decide to unblock the staff.```

not sure if my answer was more approapriate this time


[12-Feb-25 12:01 AM] vanarazor#0000
(I was thinking about focusing only on producing Ores and buy the ressources needed for Metals production but the price of C + O + SF + OVE+ RAT +DW + COF +PWO seemed like diversifying was the most suitable alternative


[12-Feb-25 12:05 AM] jcheung#0000

[12-Feb-25 12:09 AM] jcheung#0000
there's 3 SI recipes 😅


[12-Feb-25 12:09 AM] vanarazor#0000
Im not rich enough yet to look at other recipe but yeah some materials are a little expensive for me still


[12-Feb-25 12:09 AM] vanarazor#0000
I just have enough to produce SI for now


[12-Feb-25 12:09 AM] vanarazor#0000
can't afford AL or FLX


[12-Feb-25 12:10 AM] jcheung#0000
ok. just wanted to make sure you *weren't* doing that one, as that's a loss no matter what


[12-Feb-25 12:10 AM] jcheung#0000
so you're doing the first one then?


[12-Feb-25 12:11 AM] vanarazor#0000
on my planet I have access to FE and SI, Si seemed like a better return short term, Im doing that one


[12-Feb-25 12:11 AM] jcheung#0000
i meant


[12-Feb-25 12:11 AM] vanarazor#0000
I ll be back the cook is awaited in the kitchen)


[12-Feb-25 12:11 AM] jcheung#0000
what recipe are you using


[12-Feb-25 12:12 AM] jcheung#0000
i'm assuming the first one since you said AL and FLX are too expensive


[12-Feb-25 12:12 AM] vanarazor#0000
SIO + C + o => SI


[12-Feb-25 12:12 AM] jcheung#0000
but i'd like to confirm that before i tell you that you're losing money


[12-Feb-25 12:13 AM] vanarazor#0000
soon to be producing C and  O then only expenses are going to be WORKFORCE expenses and fuel


[12-Feb-25 12:13 AM] vanarazor#0000
brb


[12-Feb-25 12:21 AM] jcheung#0000
okay, so. there's a bunch of holes to poke in your plans.
take anything i say as my opinion, please check anything i say.

first, for recipe choice, assuming that you buy the materials from CX,
- cost C (739) + O (160) = 899
- cost AL 886
right out the gate, you can save 13-though this number is with current prices, which are subject to change-though they've been decently steady or lower for the most part in the last week
next, and more importantly, you're paying opportunity cost. the AL recipe is faster, meaning you can process more per day, pushing the split closer to 500 AIC/d (rough estimate)


[12-Feb-25 12:25 AM] jcheung#0000
granted some of these are mitigated by you producing some of your upstream materials


[12-Feb-25 12:26 AM] vanarazor#0000
interesting I actually have not done the math, I'm currently producing H2O and HCP and O ( the cost of producing were substantial since I 've had to create the production lines in order to to produce theses mats) but on the long run, it seems to be a better option since I willnot need to actually buy mats to produce SI


[12-Feb-25 12:27 AM] jcheung#0000
second, and far more importantly, planets have what's known as a COGC bonus which increases the working speed of your buildings by an additional 25%. as phobos is a trap, you'll get no benefits from that. normally you would be advised to try to align with COGC.... so this is less of a hole for you and more of an advisory


[12-Feb-25 12:29 AM] jcheung#0000
third, experts, which you may have some of already, are limited to 6 per base and 5 per specialty-splitting between extraction (COL, EXT, RIG, INC), metallurgy (SME), agriculture (FRM) will make you lose a little efficiency. this won't come into full effect for weeks to months though, so this is a non factor for the moment, but something to think about


[12-Feb-25 12:33 AM] jcheung#0000
fourth, as the market currently sits, the raw SIO is worth more than SI


[12-Feb-25 12:33 AM] jcheung#0000
by roughly 20%


[12-Feb-25 12:33 AM] jcheung#0000
maybe 30% depending on how you look at it


[12-Feb-25 12:35 AM] jcheung#0000
fifth, h2o yield on that planet is so poor that you're actually losing money compared to if you bought it on the CX


[12-Feb-25 01:09 AM] vanarazor#0000
First: if I can produce C and O against RAT DW OVE isn;t is't more profitable ?


[12-Feb-25 01:10 AM] vanarazor#0000
second: interesting, but well i started without knowing the limitation of my planets, having 4 differents ressources able to gather seemed a great deal


[12-Feb-25 01:11 AM] vanarazor#0000
thirds: Im still really novice ay (it's been 4 days) but I see where you are going, yet I was thinking that the ability of producing my Carbon could only be beneficial


[12-Feb-25 01:12 AM] vanarazor#0000
fourth: I have not seen that at all ,  on antares station commodity exchange SIO is bought for 161 aic/u while SI is bought at 1300, the demand is still lower than a couple of days tho, may be we are talking about a different market


[12-Feb-25 01:15 AM] vanarazor#0000
fifth: how can you quantify that ? you meant he amount of water i produce is not worth build the production line + workers expenses?

[12-Feb-25 01:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Technically, yes. But actually, you’re often better off collecting resources on dedicated planets.
Planets have different yields, resulting in different amounts produced per day resulting in varying amounts of production costs. Many resources aren’t competitive with the market and would cost more to extract, then just buy them from the CX


[12-Feb-25 01:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You’ll see highly specialised planets in this game, because that’s by design the most profitable way to produce stuff in this game.

[12-Feb-25 01:41 AM] jcheung#0000
that's exactly what i'm talking about.
a base full of EXT on SIO makes significantly more than a base full of SME-not including reductions from supplying your own consumables though, but that's not a significant bump (and most of the increase is selling the excess O/SIO)

Alright then.
I started with doing some Fuel refining and quickly expanded to produce some pioneer consumables and afterwards I expanded to some Rfabs and electronics along with consumables for Scientist. I currently plan to expand to turn my Rfabs to Afabs in the Antares region and generally expand to some new bases in the Antares region though I'm not sure on the general  direction which I'll take from now on

Well, I am located in Phobos and i make basic products (Steel, iron and glass). For now i only have 1 base, but i already have 2 other bases planned in prunplanner (not definitive), one will make basic prefabs (from AL) and the other will make PG and derivates. I joined here for the 1 million AIC grant, which would definetly help me 🙂

I didn't list the PG base since it's lower priority (we're looking for like 8 bases in total) but it would help us out!

The flagship of the ADI is a 1M AIC grant given to new bases in Antares, to support the development of the faction.
Another well liked part is the internal market, offering goods below market price to members


[01-Mar-25 03:46 PM] laaxus#0000
Tho, as a new player, I'd recommend playing for a week to taste what the game is like


[01-Mar-25 03:47 PM] laaxus#0000
the very early game can be though and empty. Honestly, I would have quit the game if not for the grant that gave me almost a full base right from the start

Hey Hey, I am located in Antares, currently two bases, one on SE-648c pumping out oxygen and another on Norwich making SI. I plan to keep doing more resource extraction and metallurgy where there is profit to be made.

Hello galactic people. Currently located in Antares-I - Phobos (ZC-307d)

Im looking for something long term that I can grow along with it. Always been a fan of PBBG's and something like ADI scratches that itch pretty good. I love trade and business and this has both.

3. Build extractors and smelters for the silicon 

3. Farming since the planet is fertile

Hey guys I’m located in the Hortus and Boucher system. (but my Boucher base is a leased permit base on wet water)  I am sixty days into prun and loving it! i currently have three bases but am wanting to expand into Antares space to try out a new industry since farming is all i’ve done for the past two months. I’m open to suggestions on what kinda base i should make, I guess I came here for guidance as much as the grant 😂

Cool! I think it would have to be in Antares space for most people to want to sponsor a grant, but that’s just an FYI. I’ll role ya

Once you get a base on say harmonia or life or Demeter (potential grant planets for farms) we will change it from associate to member

Not to intensely disappoint you, but I think that server reset is still probably a year+ off


[02-Apr-25 08:14 PM] megamint#0000
I was wondering. It's been a few years since I was last on so I forgot how often it was


[02-Apr-25 08:14 PM] megamint#0000

[06-Apr-25 10:51 AM] wiseor#0000
Alright, seems other's have written the same just before me! I'm also on Harmonia and will try to fill the CX with RAT, dunno why it's so empty atm. Played the game before, same role but on Promitor as main base. Got a bunch of money, built the planet admin on Odysseus (I think it was Odysseus at least, some planet there abouts 😄 ) and was governor for a few months.


[06-Apr-25 10:51 AM] wiseor#0000
So I actually LEFT a trust fond worth about 18 million back then :p

I am here to at some point, not yet (probably), to apply for the AGP when I get around starting a base close to Antares Space. (I currently have a ship doing contract work close to and in the Antares regon)

Oh, this is going to take a bit...  Hi, I'm Zen.  I'm also based out of Benten/Katoa.  I'm working finishing on my 24th base permit in about a week.  I have 25 ships.  My ultimate goal is to get gateways connected out to the RIM.  RIM expansion is a core desire of the corp to which I belong.


[10-Apr-25 11:44 PM] zenwhisper#0000
However I know getting the core CXx linked up first is the basis for how the gateway network will branch out.  So although I eventually want to get to the Hubur CX I know that is ambitious.  I am the governor of Harpina a fuel producing FF waypoint to get from Moria to Hubur.  I have been preparing for gateways since the blog announcement.  Here's what I've collected so far, 70% of a base gateway:

I am located at Antarez IV - Harmonia (ZV-896b).  I just saw the offer for a loan and thought I would check out the server.  I've played before and am getting back into the game, so I don't have a pro account yet so I wouldn't be able to accept the loan yet if I decided to accept it.  @jvaler


[12-Apr-25 12:38 PM] laaxus#0000
It's not a loan, it's a grant


[12-Apr-25 12:38 PM] laaxus#0000
Would you please update your name ?


[12-Apr-25 12:56 PM] senlis#0000
I might have been confused.  Isn't it [username | company code], or did I update my name in the wrong place?


[12-Apr-25 12:58 PM] igfloz#0000
I think the bot might have been a bit slow - I noticed a disparity between your posts earlier - someone will role you  🙂

Thanks! Located in Phobos, still too new to have really definitive goals besides scaling out my production capabilities (Constructor) and get a feel for the game. Most likely direction is probably to specialize into a niche (not necessarily a specific product, but definitely not trying to diversify to the level required for any degree of self-sufficiency)


[14-Apr-25 10:29 AM] laaxus#0000
I really should do a small tutorial / introduction text I could copy paste

[14-Apr-25 10:29 AM] laaxus#0000
first of all, I would recommend to play the game for a week, just to get a feel of it, to see if you like it

I would recommend playing on browser, and installing refined prun, as it gives a lot of (needed) QoL

Refined PrUn - QoL extension for Prosperous Universe
Prosperous Universe is a great game, but some missing features and minor annoyances can disrupt the experience. So here be dragons.  Refined PrUn started as a fork of PMMG Extended and ended up being an almost complete rewrite of the base extension. The result is better performance and UI responsiveness, as well as new features and QoL improveme...

if you don't know what to plan for, the ADI gives a grant of 1M AIC, so you can plan your future base


[14-Apr-25 10:33 AM] laaxus#0000
you can get more information on that in #agp-information and #agp-operations

[14-Apr-25 10:58 AM] harkenn#0000
Thanks, all useful information. Its a bit unfortunate that the recommended way to play the game isn't in the native client, but I definitely see the advantage of browser + extension

[14-Apr-25 11:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The browser was first, the steam client is just the browser version in a window without a search bar  😅


[14-Apr-25 11:00 AM] harkenn#0000
Yeah, being able to right-click in the steam client and inspect the DOM was funny


[14-Apr-25 11:01 AM] realharvey#0000
the steamversion only really exists to attract players


[14-Apr-25 11:01 AM] harkenn#0000

it's only been like what, a little over half a year since the last IDC nerf?


[14-Apr-25 12:21 PM] .urpalhal#0000

they could have given it more than a month of notice


[14-Apr-25 12:32 PM] jcheung#0000

it's a 7 weeks notice

[14-Apr-25 12:34 PM] jcheung#0000
i meant more, give people who dropped a base recently enough notice to recoup their investment at current rates

Yes and there’s about 50,000 messages on the main Discord for you to read @evany.

IDC will still be profitable for 7 weeks, and even afterwards

i have a tough time keeping up with here.


[14-Apr-25 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
Summary is IDC -> 11k, EDC -> 8k, and big buffs to other MM items


[14-Apr-25 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
Data core stuff starts on 5/5 and tails off over 4 weeks


[14-Apr-25 12:35 PM] evany.#0000
honestly that sounds good


[14-Apr-25 12:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
I agree and I make _tons_ of money from edc/idc

IDC will still be profitable afterwards
Just not outrageously so
Great patch


[14-Apr-25 12:36 PM] jcheung#0000
the ROI currently is over half a year. even a quarter heads up is still a bit short


[14-Apr-25 12:36 PM] jcheung#0000
after nerf the ROI will be in years


[14-Apr-25 12:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, but the input prices are HUGELY inflated atm


[14-Apr-25 12:37 PM] laaxus#0000
My malahat base will still be 140K profit / d


[14-Apr-25 12:37 PM] evany.#0000
i just dropped a base two days ago that will bomb now too probably but thats OK.


[14-Apr-25 12:37 PM] jcheung#0000
what prices do you use? make your own?


[14-Apr-25 12:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
HMU if it bombs, I can help out


[14-Apr-25 12:38 PM] laaxus#0000
IDC at 11k and using allocater 50d package at 11M


[14-Apr-25 12:38 PM] evany.#0000
the static market maker was dumb from the get go


[14-Apr-25 12:38 PM] laaxus#0000
currently, producing mea is HUGELY profitable
If you consume your mea production, it's good enough

#associate-planning


[14-Apr-25 12:39 PM] evany.#0000
i would have slowly crept up rpices of market makers that dont get filled and slowly / dynamically reduce prices on things that are abundantly filled (EDC/IDC)


[14-Apr-25 12:42 PM] jcheung#0000
like 1% change monthly on the top and bottom 10 traded by quantity and for top and bottom 10 by total transaction $


[14-Apr-25 12:42 PM] jcheung#0000
or maybe even .5%


[14-Apr-25 12:42 PM] evany.#0000
not even that slow


[14-Apr-25 12:43 PM] evany.#0000
just do .1% increase a day for things that aren't filled i.e change some random drone thing from 10k to 10100 if the order wasn't filled


[14-Apr-25 12:43 PM] evany.#0000
and if the order was filled (just like you can place an order for 1000 edc) just have it reduce by 1% everytime 1000 is sold


[14-Apr-25 12:44 PM] evany.#0000
simple, fixed once and your not having to 'move bars' you might just adjust %'s every quarter or something


[14-Apr-25 12:55 PM] evany.#0000
would solve things like bfabs not being profitable for newer players to build and sell too upon further consideration

1) to see if you can follow simple directions. It might sound silly, but a lot of people join, never change their nick, and never even speak on the server before leaving.
2) we have two different roles for members (Antares based players) and non members(everyone else). Having that opening blurb about where you're based helps a lot for us not having to go dig up that information ourselves

generally when people mention a 3 letter code, its a material or building, you can find out what it is by using the command `MAT IDC`, or for buildings; `BUI XXX`

Welcome, btw 😂 🙈 

I see nobody onboarded you...

Feel free to ask any questions about the game in #associate-office  - we're happy to help 🙂
Also, we provide a 1 mil AIC grant (free money) to new players to boost you up a bit out of the really slow early-game. More informations can be found in #agp-information. If you're ready to apply for one, please do in #agp-operations.

I'm kinda specialized myself on ores and metals, so if you have any specific questions about that, let me know 😉


[17-Apr-25 01:41 AM] old_bean#0000
Sweet, thanks

[18-Apr-25 03:23 PM] i4gor8082#0000
i should do that


[18-Apr-25 03:23 PM] i4gor8082#0000
instead of using one lazy password for every random account i make


[18-Apr-25 03:24 PM] laaxus#0000
if you hate the idea of passwords manager (you shouldn't) just generate passwords and save them on paper


[18-Apr-25 03:24 PM] laaxus#0000
you can't hack paper


[18-Apr-25 03:24 PM] laaxus#0000
however, if you lose the paper, you lose everything


[18-Apr-25 03:24 PM] laaxus#0000
and you still need to use 2FA

My main base is in Phobos producing MCG and COF and extracting SIO. I recently set up a new base in Nike and am extracting LST for the production of MCG in Phobos.

With the help of ADI, I intend to learn more about the game, where to expand and how to invest correctly for better growth. I spent a long time buying and selling incorrectly and only in the last 2 months have I learned how to use the FIO tool to invest better.

@jvaler I've updated my name. Looking to expand my productions in Antares region with the help of ADI grant.


[28-Apr-25 08:46 AM] laaxus#0000
What's your ***in-game*** location and what are you producing ?


[28-Apr-25 08:47 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm at work, so I can't show you around and do the onboarding


[28-Apr-25 08:47 AM] laaxus#0000
But you should have full access now


[28-Apr-25 08:48 AM] pyriand#0000
Currently situated in Hortus producing RAT/DW, looking to expand into maybe CL production in Griffonstone


[28-Apr-25 08:49 AM] pagy1234#0000
those are very far apart


[28-Apr-25 08:50 AM] pagy1234#0000
especially as CL is pretty heavy


[28-Apr-25 08:50 AM] pagy1234#0000
and the H2O for DW can be a strain on logistics


[28-Apr-25 09:02 AM] pyriand#0000
Is the ADI grant have to be exactly in Antares faction space or can it be 1 jump away?


[28-Apr-25 09:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
ask Jvaler in #agp-operations


[28-Apr-25 09:10 AM] pagy1234#0000
they run the grant program


[28-Apr-25 12:35 PM] jvaler#0000
it has to be generally within antares space. "if the base is closer to ANT than any other CX" seems like decent criteria i just made up =P

I got started with the game yesterday, one more acronym is not doing much of a difference


[29-Apr-25 09:44 AM] .urpalhal#0000
#shipping is where we talk about shipping contracts.
We have a grant of 1 million AIC to help you get started that’s #agp-operations you can talk there about the base you want and older players will help you out with what would be best to do.
#internal-offers has internal offers to help get you some materials and supplies for cheaper


[29-Apr-25 09:45 AM] loans_13178#0000
This one might, Its basically a one time 1,000,000 AIC grant for new players.


[29-Apr-25 09:47 AM] jhyn.#0000
like a 0% loan to get a fully built base quicker?


[29-Apr-25 09:47 AM] .urpalhal#0000
No just money


[29-Apr-25 09:47 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[29-Apr-25 09:49 AM] loans_13178#0000
think of it more like a student aid grant


[29-Apr-25 09:49 AM] jhyn.#0000
I'll maybe take a few days to get started before going too fast, I'm not exactly sure of my plans atm


[29-Apr-25 09:50 AM] jhyn.#0000
I was looking to go into food processing in Harmonia but I see there is this 25% agriculture CoGC bonus, is this permanent ?

hello!


[30-Apr-25 02:02 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Welcome 🙂


[30-Apr-25 02:03 AM] beer_from_bavaria#0000
so this might be wierd, i tried prosperous a couple years ago but never got really into it (due playing solo not beeing my thing) so this time i decided to look for a community before i start the game


[30-Apr-25 02:03 AM] beer_from_bavaria#0000
also i`d need boat loats of training and intel to get this off the ground but i am willing (and hardened by years of playing eve online)


[30-Apr-25 02:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
then you're at the right place 😄


[30-Apr-25 02:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
PrUn has one of the best communities I ever witnessed and (for me personally) at least half of the game


[30-Apr-25 02:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Where are you located currently (in-game)? Or didn't you start yet?


[30-Apr-25 02:05 AM] beer_from_bavaria#0000
havent started yet, so i am free to choose a fitting starting place (and profession)


[30-Apr-25 02:05 AM] beer_from_bavaria#0000
either going for victualer or fuel refiner was my idea


[30-Apr-25 02:06 AM] pxlfox.#0000
While you're here, I would warmly recommend to start in Antares. This is the Discord server of the Antares Development Initiative (ADI), basically THE place to communicate and trade in the Antares region.


[30-Apr-25 02:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
We provide also a 1 mil grant (free money) to new players to kickstart your business a bit


[30-Apr-25 02:07 AM] laaxus#0000
you chose the best place 😄


[30-Apr-25 02:07 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But to be fair, other regions do that to


[30-Apr-25 02:08 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Victualer was food, wasn't it?


[30-Apr-25 02:08 AM] beer_from_bavaria#0000
i saw that, but i am not here for the money. i´d rather get a helping hand and a community 😄


[30-Apr-25 02:08 AM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend starting on deimos as metallurgist
1) because it's a job that is going to be needed more and more
2) all the slots are taken so only new players can make a base there


[30-Apr-25 02:08 AM] beer_from_bavaria#0000
yes sir


[30-Apr-25 02:08 AM] laaxus#0000
the job only set your starting buildings


[30-Apr-25 02:09 AM] laaxus#0000
it doesn't give any bonus whatsoever mid to long term


[30-Apr-25 02:09 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd recommend playing for a week


[30-Apr-25 02:09 AM] laaxus#0000
then you'll understand why people take the grant 😄 (the very early game is very harsh and can be unfun)


[30-Apr-25 02:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Food processing on Harmonia is also a save bet imo. Agriculture is low-logistics and perfect for the early-game. And consumables are always in demand


[30-Apr-25 02:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
With metals you'll have to ship more (probably daily), since the materials are all a bit heavier. Aluminium (AL) isn't that profitable atm, but we all hope it will rise in the next few weeks.


[30-Apr-25 02:11 AM] laaxus#0000
AL too :UltraMad:


[30-Apr-25 02:12 AM] laaxus#0000
SME are not less profitable than farms


[30-Apr-25 02:12 AM] laaxus#0000

But again, the starting profession is really just a start and doesn't dictate your future gameplay


[30-Apr-25 02:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It's really not that important at it does seem at the beginning


[30-Apr-25 02:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Deimos has some prestige in this region, because it's basically always full.


[30-Apr-25 02:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
(and a great planet)


[30-Apr-25 02:18 AM] beer_from_bavaria#0000
i`ll start with food on harmonia, low logistics seems to be a better start for me now :9
