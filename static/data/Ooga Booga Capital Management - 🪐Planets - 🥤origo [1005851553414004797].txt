It works, a have acces.


[07-Aug-22 03:31 PM] yang_mills#0000
MHL, PG, BGO and much more.


[08-Aug-22 02:26 AM] allocater#0000
if someone wants to convert gold into connectors here, it would be easier to transport off the planet.


[08-Aug-22 02:26 AM] allocater#0000
demand is 80 BGC + 120 HCC every 5 days


[08-Aug-22 08:28 AM] archielvahr#0000
I can happily provide the AUO to such an operation


[09-Aug-22 05:35 PM] emperyan11#0000
I've got a hundred tons or so of gold just junking up my warehouse right now...


[10-Aug-22 01:53 AM] allocater#0000
gold or gold ore? shipping contracts for 5000AIC are accepted by randos to ANT


[11-Aug-22 03:23 PM] jackinabox86#0000
Do we have any MG here or preferably closer to civilization?


[11-Aug-22 03:36 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've got up to 300 MG and 200 MGS available now on QJ


[11-Aug-22 03:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have prices on the corp sheet, and am ramping up extraction of MGS.

[13-Aug-22 08:32 AM] churavis#0000
QJ-650c already has all the infrastructure built out but is further away from Harmonia/YK-649b (our Agriculture and Food Processing worlds) and already has an OOG governor
QJ-149c only has COGC and a safety station so we'd need to build the LM/WAR/ADM, but it's closer to Harmonia/YK-649b and on the way to those planets from Demeter; it also does not require SEA


[13-Aug-22 05:44 PM] rune_242#0000
I would make this the INC planet


[13-Aug-22 05:44 PM] rune_242#0000
and YK-649b the FP planet


[13-Aug-22 05:46 PM] churavis#0000
Not QJ-149c?


[13-Aug-22 05:51 PM] rune_242#0000
either way is fine to me


[13-Aug-22 05:52 PM] rune_242#0000
we would have to change to GOGC but thats no a big problem with our big corporation

now you mention it


[13-Aug-22 06:09 PM] rune_242#0000
preventing from having to build a GOGC would save a lot of money


[13-Aug-22 06:10 PM] churavis#0000
QJ-149c has a COGC but not much else


[13-Aug-22 06:29 PM] yang_mills#0000
YK-649b looks better for an FP planet.


[13-Aug-22 06:30 PM] rune_242#0000
because it's closer?


[13-Aug-22 06:30 PM] churavis#0000
That's pretty much been decided, we just need to decide on the INC planet


[13-Aug-22 06:32 PM] yang_mills#0000
A resource extraction bonus makes a lot of sense for QJ-650c.


[13-Aug-22 06:32 PM] churavis#0000
Both planets have a resource extraction bonus


[13-Aug-22 06:33 PM] rune_242#0000
Bary, why would you go for YK instead of QJ?


[13-Aug-22 06:33 PM] yang_mills#0000
YK-649b is one jump away from Harmonia I believe.


[13-Aug-22 06:33 PM] rune_242#0000
good point


[13-Aug-22 06:35 PM] rune_242#0000
if we build the FP base would it not be a good idea to have a 2K ship dedicated for that?


[13-Aug-22 06:36 PM] yang_mills#0000
Sure.


[13-Aug-22 06:36 PM] rune_242#0000
since crops have the same m¬≥/tonnage and water too


[14-Aug-22 02:02 AM] allocater#0000
is this the vote for INC of FP?

seems there are 3 candidates and the flows would be like this?

[14-Aug-22 04:01 AM] rune_242#0000
Yk-649b will be FP planet


[14-Aug-22 04:49 AM] yuen8241#0000
Is it appropriate for Crop Planet and FP Planet to be so far away? I mean Demeter. It takes 8 jumps to get to fp.


[14-Aug-22 04:55 AM] allocater#0000
yeah, but demeter products have to reach ANT anyway, so it is just a stop on the way. Also shipping will become easier with time, as we build more ships.


[15-Aug-22 11:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
400 MGS available on QJ-650c, 500 MGS on ANT. @350/u


[15-Aug-22 01:04 PM] allocater#0000
so much for my attempt to buy a shipload at 100/u üòÑ


[15-Aug-22 01:11 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can get you MG at 60/u üòâ  Honestly I will have to check the price again when I'm at my PRUNner computer. I think they are all set to make the same price per day on CLI/MGS/AUO


[15-Aug-22 01:14 PM] allocater#0000
I only remembered Yang sells for 50, but that seemed too low for current market, so I doubled it.


[15-Aug-22 01:26 PM] yang_mills#0000
I have 250 MG on QJ-650c and can sell it at 60 AIC/u.


[15-Aug-22 01:32 PM] allocater#0000
but what about MGS?


[15-Aug-22 02:04 PM] yang_mills#0000
I don't produce excess MGS. One reason is that reprocessing MGS allows for a slight weight compression. The other reason is that I prefer to extract more CLI and AUO.


[15-Aug-22 02:05 PM] allocater#0000
oh, have to adjust my notes


[15-Aug-22 02:10 PM] allocater#0000
various ads up


[15-Aug-22 02:12 PM] yang_mills#0000
I don't have enough AUO on QJ-650 c right now. But if you are willing to post a buy order at 155,01 AIC/u (0,01 AIC above the bid price) on ANT CX, then I could sell you 100 AUO immediately (on the CX).

Making SOI for Phobos


[03-Sep-22 12:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yes, I have an abundance of CLI. 250 now, and I have 8 EXT I can switch over


[03-Sep-22 12:48 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can sell it at 125/u (dropped the price that was on the corp sheet)


[03-Sep-22 01:13 PM] domicius#0000
Great, I'll drop you a contract in a bit


[08-Sep-22 10:06 PM] yuen8241#0000
I found that all the mines on this planet are very heavy. Have all your 500 spaces been built with EXT?


[08-Sep-22 11:33 PM] archielvahr#0000
Actually 744/750, but out of that I have 8 EXT. I process MGS, AUO, and CLI (into Iodine) locally on the planet


[09-Sep-22 11:26 AM] churavis#0000
Anyone have AUO or AU available here or nearer to Deimos?


[09-Sep-22 11:52 AM] allocater#0000
500 on ANT


[09-Sep-22 11:56 AM] churavis#0000
I'll take 100, I didn't see a price on the sheet


[09-Sep-22 11:57 AM] allocater#0000
150/u


[09-Sep-22 12:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I generally produce extra AUO, and I also have 230 HCC available on ANT for 400/u. (maybe lower, I'd have to do some math after work on that)


[09-Sep-22 09:04 PM] archielvahr#0000

In terms of capacity, do you have any spare MGS or MG for sale in the long run? My license is not enough.


[20-Sep-22 10:43 AM] archielvahr#0000
I do. I ship excess to the CX pretty often, you can see my CX stock on the exchange. I will take those orders down and sell it at a lower price to you. Or you can buy directly on QJ-650c too.

welcome to the planet! Unfortunately I don't- I keep a little bit of MCG and SEA around, but no fabs


[01-Dec-22 01:13 PM] churavis#0000
What are our plans for this planet?


[01-Dec-22 01:20 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Chem would be good


[01-Dec-22 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Unfortunately it's been a mix so far. Some people do mostly EXTs. I'm heavy on Metallurgy, using the gold in FS for HCCs. I think that's a good choice because shipping the AU/AUO (or RGO/BGO) is not very cost effective. Much better to break it down as much as possible. Melon makes ship parts on planet with the gold. I also do MHL production due to the Iodine on planet, but that's a niche use case. (it's "construction" apparently).


[01-Dec-22 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
So that's why it's been a pioneer COGC.


[01-Dec-22 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
What's the use case for Chemistry? Doesn't seem to particularly fit the CLI or AUO or MGS on the planet


[01-Dec-22 02:29 PM] churavis#0000
I have made a thread for this discussion in Strategy


[01-Dec-22 02:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
ah didn't see that, I'll move over there


[03-Dec-22 09:05 AM] churavis#0000
@Elon do we want to change the planet to chemistry right now or keep it pioneer boosted for another week? voting ends in 54 minutes


[03-Dec-22 10:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
I woke up too late, so next week it is


[03-Dec-22 11:08 AM] churavis#0000

Population just rolled over. We have 2200 unemployed pioneers (10% reserve)  and 496 open settler jobs. 84% happiness before the festivity hit, so we should be maxing out that growth

[03-Dec-22 05:17 PM] archielvahr#0000

400 MG available for 50/u


[14-Dec-22 07:58 PM] archielvahr#0000
Next POPI report is in 3 days. Population and happiness is looking pretty good if anyone wants to add buildings.


[14-Dec-22 07:59 PM] churavis#0000

Ah okay, that sheds a bit of light on the situation. Not sure why he named that particular system- must be in contact with someone still.


[15-Dec-22 03:51 PM] mrtcsmith#0000
Yeah considering their base is in Katoa it's an interesting use of their naming rights


[15-Dec-22 03:52 PM] archielvahr#0000
I imagine it was more like, "hey buddy, log into that game you bought a supporter pack for in the previous universe and rename my system for me" type of situation

[19-Dec-22 05:56 AM] paxmagellanic#0000
13:33]PaxMagellanic: Hey, good morning! Just a small reminder about this, if you ever get the chance to look into it ^^
[13:49]molp: Morning! I quickly talked with Martin about this issue on the weekend. We have a central registry where we store entity names (think, users, system, planets, brokers, ..). It seems there is no planet or system that is called Midas, but there has to be a company with that name, effectively blocking that name to be used for a planet. 
As you can imagine there is no quick solution to that. I could try to figure out if that company is still active and if not try to COLIQ it manually.
[13:54]molp: Found it, it is a company co mds

So it seems we need to select another name.

I've had that dilemma on Vulcan. Taxes are low, but everyone is mainly extracting and smelting. So if I raise taxes, everyone gets hosed. And the money goes to the Corp so it won't actually help me at all pay for stuff (which is a wierd mechanism)

I think if we do it we do it universally. Don‚Äôt make exceptions for starter planets as that‚Äôs where a large percentage of the population is. If we do it across OOG with then number of planets we control assuming we continue to do a good job a raise it small amounts at at time I would think people would go along with it.

For new players or those thinking of getting into the PG market, I would like to repeat my offer of selling MG for cheap on planet. If you buy it in bulk regularly, the spot price is just 45/u.

experts time requirements are flat, so the time scales based on number of lines running


[11-Sep-23 02:12 PM] mrsmith33#0000
So, that base will need ~1000 C,H,MG each per 10 days


[11-Sep-23 02:13 PM] mrsmith33#0000

I make it here for everyone that makes PG so you came specialize in all chemistry and have more room for POL. Normally 50, I take 5 off if you agree to buy from me regularly in bulk, so just 45 each total.


[15-Sep-23 01:55 PM] churavis#0000

[16-Sep-23 12:58 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I just looked at this - having a PG base (and selling internally on auction) is a great way to make friends while making the $$. However, this plan doesn't have a STO in it, and you need 1 level to make the base work.


[16-Sep-23 03:26 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is storage needed for inputs or outputs? Although I bought all the materials already, I can tweak the plan


[16-Sep-23 03:28 AM] mrsmith33#0000
What is the source of H for Elon? Can I buy it locally?


[16-Sep-23 03:32 AM] rune_242#0000

60/u on elon


[16-Sep-23 03:33 AM] rune_242#0000
40/u on KI-401d


[16-Sep-23 05:05 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Storage is needed for everything that isn't in the production buildings.
C,H & MG each take up 1 unit space, and a PG-focused base uses 105 units of each every day. So 5 days worth of materials will require 1,500m3 storage space. That doesn't take into account the space needed for consumables (200-500m3 space), or the PG that is produced. Unless you're gonna visit the base every 4-5 days, you will probably need 1 layer of STO.


[16-Sep-23 05:08 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Is warehouse rent not an option?

Buying 1 BTA on LM for 1300


[27-Sep-23 11:10 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Ship from Elon to Ant in 28-Sep-23 03:20 AM


[27-Sep-23 11:12 AM] churavis#0000
If you have extra space on it then post exactly how much space you have on the shipping channel


[27-Sep-23 11:12 AM] mrsmith33#0000
ok, let me calculate


[01-Oct-23 04:06 PM] rune_242#0000
is anybody having trouble getting H to elon?


[01-Oct-23 04:07 PM] mrsmith33#0000
if you have no trouble - I have no trouble


[01-Oct-23 04:08 PM] rune_242#0000
you can send a contract at any time for H on elon


[01-Oct-23 04:08 PM] mrsmith33#0000
that 2000 H will be enough for a long time


[01-Oct-23 04:09 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I still have 430 H from previous contract


[01-Oct-23 04:09 PM] rune_242#0000
gues I'm back to dumping on the CX


[01-Oct-23 04:10 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I'm going to double the production once I consume more PG myself. But I am far from that yet.


[01-Oct-23 11:55 PM] tuffyless#0000
I'll take H on Elon ... burning it on PG & PE.  Will send a contd.


[02-Oct-23 02:52 AM] rune_242#0000
Do you make PE on Elon?


[02-Oct-23 07:37 AM] tuffyless#0000
only enough to keep an FS active.  Dont have enough C yet for more PE.


[02-Oct-23 04:59 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Anyone selling CL on Elon?


[02-Oct-23 05:13 PM] churavis#0000
Most chem bases here are just making PG


[02-Oct-23 05:15 PM] mrsmith33#0000
I do occasional EPO batches


[02-Oct-23 05:57 PM] fremen45#0000
are you looking for a CL supplier?


[02-Oct-23 06:33 PM] higgsy#0000
Where do people make their EPO?


[02-Oct-23 06:57 PM] pateirn#0000
Griff and 759d for me


[02-Oct-23 06:57 PM] tuffyless#0000
Griff


[02-Oct-23 10:00 PM] hernanduer#0000

Soon to be electronica


[03-Oct-23 03:13 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Yes. But not too much. It may be a better idea to deliver CL myself from ANT. Or buy from someone who already delivers CL to Elon. I think 96 CL / 10 days will be enough for now.


[03-Oct-23 03:15 AM] fremen45#0000
Fair enough I will transport to ANT and you can ping me when you need some. is 3000 a unit acceptable?


[03-Oct-23 03:16 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Yep


[03-Oct-23 03:17 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Eventually I may produce it myself


[13-Oct-23 06:44 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Electronica, ZV-759d, ZV-639d.


[13-Oct-23 06:45 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I started making EPO at Griff, but it turns out Griff is the best place to put up LABs, so I converted.


[15-Oct-23 02:46 PM] higgsy#0000
People really make EPO on ZV-639d? It's a Nitrogen gas planet


[15-Oct-23 02:51 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
ANT needs more Chem planets. 
EPO is more valuable than NS to me.


[15-Oct-23 03:13 PM] melon164#0000
I‚Äôm working up WU-974c, come help!


[16-Oct-23 10:30 AM] hernanduer#0000
there's uhh, 7 I think


[16-Oct-23 10:32 AM] hernanduer#0000
Griff, Elon, 639d, 759d, Electronica, 840c, and...


[16-Oct-23 02:29 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
LABs, PG (x2 bases), EPO, EPO, EPO, SOI/REA


[16-Oct-23 02:29 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
Also ZV-307b, where I have AMLs.


[16-Oct-23 02:30 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I found a new player who's permit I rent: I paid for their base, supply the raw mats for free and in return I get PG at 10/unit.


[16-Oct-23 07:10 PM] hernanduer#0000
So much EPO


[03-Nov-23 12:51 PM] higgsy#0000
Ad up for 100 MG at 120/u on Elon LM


[03-Nov-23 12:52 PM] higgsy#0000
Or send me contract and name your price


[03-Nov-23 01:17 PM] churavis#0000
I stockpile MG on both ANT and Elon at 50/u or less for long term bulk contracts


[04-Nov-23 06:26 AM] rune_242#0000
somebody pls buy H on elon
all of my STO is full and I have 4k H still sitting in ships


[04-Nov-23 08:01 AM] churavis#0000
Contracts sent, I guessed at the price so just send me new contacts if it's not right


[04-Nov-23 08:08 AM] rune_242#0000

[04-Nov-23 08:08 AM] rune_242#0000

[04-Nov-23 01:04 PM] tuffyless#0000
Same ... sent a Elon contd for 1k.


[04-Nov-23 02:14 PM] higgsy#0000
LM buy ads up for H on Elon.


[24-Mar-24 11:04 AM] mrsmith33#0000
CoGC on strike


[24-Mar-24 11:04 AM] tuffyless#0000
it's back up


[30-Apr-24 05:03 PM] emperyan11#0000
Anyone need anything shipped back home? I got 500t/m3 open


[31-May-24 05:55 PM] tuffyless#0000
Churaviis - do you still sell MGS or MG on Elon en-mass?


[31-May-24 09:40 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, 45 if you buy it regularly, 50 otherwise


[31-May-24 09:43 PM] tuffyless#0000
MG, right?


[31-May-24 09:43 PM] churavis#0000
Yes, MG


[31-May-24 09:46 PM] tuffyless#0000
ok awesome.  Am rearranging my Elon base for max PG but dont know the numbers just yet.


[31-May-24 09:46 PM] churavis#0000
I've got plenty of spare capacity


[31-May-24 09:46 PM] churavis#0000
The only stipulation is that you can't sell MG anywhere on any CX


[31-May-24 09:47 PM] tuffyless#0000
haha of course! 
In fact, Im hoping that's understood by us all w/ the Auctions too and such. üôÇ

So lemme get the fabs allocated & figure out frequency & quantity,  then will prolly be sending contds sometime afterwards.

[31-May-24 09:49 PM] churavis#0000
Just send a contract whenever you need more MG, I'll get it to you in a day or less

[20-Jun-24 06:04 PM] tuffyless#0000
Finally got Elon setup w/ POL's making PG.
Will need to send for MG in a week or so.

Any time you need it I got it

@Elon election is active for only 16 more hours, let's try to get Paris governor and me as a MP

[26-Jun-24 08:57 AM] hernanduer#0000
at least 1 more vote for me to be above nano


[26-Jun-24 08:58 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I guess being governor is not important when you have 2 PM


[26-Jun-24 08:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
nope


[26-Jun-24 08:58 AM] sidepipe#0000
Voted for Paris üôÇ

your name isn't even on the planet screen PLI anymore


[26-Jun-24 09:17 AM] archielvahr#0000
You cool with that plan, @parisinspringtime ? Not sure if you are coordinating on Elon with Rise


[26-Jun-24 09:21 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I'm not specifically. 
Previously, Rise had frozenice as governor and was handling the upkeep (while syphoning the income). He's now asked frozenice to step aside and asked friends to vote for him so he can run it directly.


[26-Jun-24 10:46 AM] tuffyless#0000
voted for Paris.  5 currently.  Rise has 6.


[26-Jun-24 10:48 AM] churavis#0000
Voted, you're now even


[26-Jun-24 10:48 AM] churavis#0000
How are ties determined?


[26-Jun-24 10:57 AM] archielvahr#0000
I'm not sure if anyone knows


[26-Jun-24 12:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Nano doesn‚Äôt want us on Elon


[26-Jun-24 12:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So I who should I vote for?


[26-Jun-24 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Nano will be okay


[26-Jun-24 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
If we are feeling stretched, no need to pile on for Elon, I think.


[26-Jun-24 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have a soft spot for it because I was it's first governor (for 20 consecutive terms). But I also have a hard spot because it's got a dumb name now.

I am happy having two MPs to back up rise, and to be able to have our MPs log the finances


[26-Jun-24 12:28 PM] churavis#0000
Even if we're fine with Rise or someone else, it's always good to have a member of parliament in case the governor goes AFK and to let them know there's competition so they don't get lazy or greedy

[26-Jun-24 12:30 PM] akyantor#0000
Importantly you get visibility of the actually finances and not just the motions


[26-Jun-24 12:31 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah exactly


[26-Jun-24 12:32 PM] churavis#0000
I could easily see Rise get overwhelmed and burnt out with 30 planets to govern


[26-Jun-24 12:32 PM] churavis#0000
I don't want to be screwed if he goes AFK


[26-Jun-24 12:44 PM] hernanduer#0000
or he just misses some, that happens

Morning boys and girls. Thank you for the votes.


[27-Jun-24 01:52 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Always the right idea. It's auto-ingrained in me to do so after you told me to do so months ago on Deimos.


[27-Jun-24 01:59 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Rise is addicted to this game, especially the logistics, and politics is his favourite sport (I don't know why he doesn't make politics his career). Short of him being hit by a bus, he's not gonna go dark on us.


[30-Jun-24 12:34 AM] hernanduer#0000
Looks like someone just closed down a ton of AMLs


[07-Dec-24 11:36 AM] allocater#0000

I do gold, but seems everybody else does chemistry


[08-Dec-24 04:20 AM] allocater#0000
and since it's MG, probably plastics


[08-Dec-24 04:30 AM] mrsmith33#0000
There is ZV-194d for gold

A thread inside behind-the-scenes


[28-Jan-25 07:45 AM] archielvahr#0000
I didn't want it to be a whole huge thing, but I did a big writeup about why nazis are bad

tbh, fully support changing it, the guys an arse, even if you're being incredibly charitable... and there reason to not be very charitable... üôÇ

Noooo! It should have been "Midas"! üòÑ


[28-Jan-25 11:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I was advocating that. Especially since Valencia wanted that originally. But I guess molp picked a name no one particularly wanted in order to be fair to everyone


[28-Jan-25 11:55 AM] archielvahr#0000
Heh


[29-Jan-25 12:04 PM] hernanduer#0000
but Valencia named it


[29-Jan-25 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
I guess if he gave him back the rights


[29-Jan-25 12:05 PM] hernanduer#0000
but still pretty lame


[29-Jan-25 01:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Gave it back to Valencia, but valencia had no ideas so molp named it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[29-Jan-25 01:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
I think going for a latin name in ANT is just a low-key trolling, haha. But that's fine, with me heh
