**ManoftheSea**:	Phobos, it is once again election time.  As ever, my platform is: Fund the CoGC, keep taxes low.  I'm now adding some funding of the SST to ensure there are enough Pioneers for growing businesses, but I am NOT funding anything higher than health with planetary funds.  If you want Techs or above, please work with private corps to do so. (to be fair, I'm feeding the PAR myself)


[01-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I also have settled a farming planet explicitly to ensure that we have the materials to keep the CoGC running.  While I keep an accounting of Phobos's budget on the UFO server in phobos-politics (currently, Phobos owes me 30k AIC or so), I will generally use market price as I feed it out of my own supply.  This insulates the planet from higher costs (at a time when supplies are finally coming back down).


[01-Oct-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	When I say "insulates from higher cost", it means the planet will not lack RAT, PE, or MCG.  DW is slightly more difficult, but should be provided... even if prices hit the MM, it is only a budgetary concern, and I will eventually have to write off the planet's debt.  To you, citizen, you will still get the CoGC benefit.


[01-Oct-21 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alucard998**:	If anyone is interested in funding higher tier population, it came to my attention that the Library's educational bonus is worthless without Culture to back it up. As such, I believe I will be working on an Art Gallery. If you're interested in contributing to this project, please message me, either here or in Discord

**ManoftheSea**:	CEOs of Phobos, I bring this announcement to you from my table at Wendy's to inform you that an election will be held over the course of the next week.  My platform remains to keep Pioneers and Settlers available to all companies through the use of taxes; but to develop Technicians and higher through voluntary contributions.  At this time, we expect no new taxes.  As always, I keep track of Phobos's budget on the UFO server, found in Scorus's links.

[08-Nov-21 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dendagarius**:	I can supply Iron now or Steel in a couple days for any one who is in construction


[08-Nov-21 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eazy**:	I am interested in steel, i don't really know how it works though


[08-Nov-21 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eazy**:	so apparently the best way to do that is local market contracts, which require PRO license


[08-Nov-21 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Metallurgy is better done on Deimos.  There's a better source of FEO in the deimos system, and the CoGC on deimos means making FE and then STL is faster on deimos (and therefore cheaper).  However, the Phobos CoGC gives a benefit to then turn STL into PT.

**ManoftheSea**:	I see the desire for Engineers on Phobos has exploded.  To that end, I suggest that if you want engineers, you're going to have to start donating or buying for donation UTS, MHP, HOG, and it looks like we could use another level of art cafe, to which I'll apply the Capt B funds.

**rain9441**:	Hello phobros.  I'd like to take the opportunity today to begin campaigning for the future of Phobos.  No, not as governor, as the Advocate for swapping our CoGC over from Manufacturing to Electronics.  This is not a war I plan to win in a day, but I am pitching the first battle now.


[02-Dec-21 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Madnewmy and I have cast our votes for Electronics already, which puts it at a strong position.


[02-Dec-21 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The neighboring planet, Antares I C, which I'm referring to as A1C for short, can be the future foundation for manufacturing.


[02-Dec-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Manufacturing is primarily BMP and WPL for the low tier efforts.  For mid tier, it is PPFs and SCA/MCA.  For the high tier, it is basically only APF and AAF.


[02-Dec-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The APF and AAF are not really built in enough quantities that they'll really need the boost.


[02-Dec-21 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	For PPFs, SCAs, MCAs, and WPLs, there is no planetary resource supporting those buildings on Phobos.  So those buildings can go anywhere.  The only building that has any benefit from local resources is the BMP when it makes MCG.


[02-Dec-21 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	As we move into the future, the SIO on Phobos paired with the AL from the AL capital of the universe, Deimos, next door, can combine here on Phobos to make SI and then TRN (in a CLR cleanroom).  TRN is used in high amounts.  The electronics expert bonus would be substantial for TRN production and this would let us sell TRN to the rest of the universe for a lot of money.


[02-Dec-21 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Furthermore, we are in the unique spot where we have an N gas giant next door and an H gas giant in the system, lending itself for a double bonus if we have the SCA running on A1C.


[02-Dec-21 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The SCA outputs a lot of SEN and PCB which is used in ELPs that can be housed here on Phobos with the 25% electronics boost.


[02-Dec-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	This is the very foundation of Drones, which are the highest tier and a hell of a market maker


[02-Dec-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It also opens the way for Phobos to become the standard place to build software which will be in high demand when scientists are established (which is soon!)


[02-Dec-21 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Long story short... Antares I C - Manufacturing (BMPs, WPLs, PPFs, and SCAs).  Phobos - Electronics (CLR, ELP, DRS, SE, SL).


[02-Dec-21 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Only in Antares will we find this optimal chain for drone production - all within 1 jump of Phobos.

[03-Dec-21 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	I wasn't even aware rain was gonna say something about it :D


[03-Dec-21 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	I, too, support Phobos Electronics.  But maybe rain would suggest a flag day?  1 month?  2?


[03-Dec-21 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	By setting the changeover to 3 months out, it gives all current manufacturing on the planet time to naturally decay.  Rather than "tear down what you built last week and move it over", it is "don't build anything new, move stuff as they reach 90 days"


[03-Dec-21 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I've been surprised by the lack of higher level manufacturing going on on this manufacturing planet! That said, it seems like it will be a long time before A1C will be able to field the techs and engs necessary for it to support Phobos electronics needs.

[03-Dec-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Specialization into drones is more profitable than APF-LOG


[03-Dec-21 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	as for flag day.  It's whenever majority votes it.  We've already split the votes, and it seems like a perfecty natural progression to let everyone vote what benefits them the most that week

[13-Dec-21 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I'll vote electronics once we get scientists.


[13-Dec-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Until then, I just don't see the use in it.

**rain9441**:	We don't need to build a manufacturing cogc on A1C, we just need the votes


[14-Dec-21 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Rain, again, no, the "antares group that is boosting the area" is not tax funded.  Your Phobos taxes support low-tier on Phobos.


[14-Dec-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I thought Harmonia's COGC+ADM were built using Deimos taxes?


[14-Dec-21 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	And wasnt there some sponsored HE3 initiative where the government paid for someone to settle an HE3 planet?


[14-Dec-21 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	All of the Deimos taxes that went into the Harmonia COGC and ADM were repaid by Harmonia.


[14-Dec-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Using deimos tax money, a loan was used to build out a COGC and ADM on another planet, which was eventually repaid.  I guess I dont understand why thats different than using tax money to setup a COGC on A1C


[14-Dec-21 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	and then taxing A1C to get the money back eventually


[14-Dec-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Taxes that go towards loans that are eventually paid is still tax money given to increase the viability of a region


[14-Dec-21 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	The deimos governor felt it was a good use of tax money to improve local production of RAT, DW and C. If you can convince a current governor to do the same to improve another planet, then that's that.


[14-Dec-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Good thing I don't have to, I'm only looking to convince people to work towards building up electronics in phobos and move manufacturing elsewhere.


[14-Dec-21 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It's Slomes who wants the COGC built


[14-Dec-21 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	And I think Slomes has pointed out that a COGC would help to convince people of that.


[14-Dec-21 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It is my intent to lobby for electronics, not to buy off votes


[14-Dec-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I think many people realize the rich potential of the Electronics CoGC.  We're seeing a few votes in that favor.  I implore all citizens of Phobos to research the potential for Antares to be the high end electronics producer of the universe.


[14-Dec-21 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Every day drone market makers become more lucrative, and with electronics CoGCs we can produce more drones more efficiently than any other region


[14-Dec-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	While manufacturing does help this process, Electronics will help far more.


[14-Dec-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	ELPs, DRS, and CLRs with on site SIO and an adjacent mega AL supplier... It has incredible potential!


[14-Dec-21 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Not to mention we can drop SEs to spam software development that is sent straight to the market makers as well via selling EDCs


[14-Dec-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Incredibly easy source of income, usable on any CX


[14-Dec-21 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I have always thought that Electronics was the future for Phobos (and you were one of the ones that thought that foolish, I remember). But we aren't there yet. I'm not ready to turn on a dime for an mm. When we have scientists and can start on WAI and such, it will be time in my book.


[14-Dec-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Then you are already convinced!


[14-Dec-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	:D


[14-Dec-21 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	As I've said numerous times, when we have scientists, I'll vote for electronics.

**Scorus**:	Welcome new Phobians! There is a discord channel for you to ask questions and coordinate: https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP


[14-Dec-21 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	A long time ago, a Phobos governor did fund the Antares Fuel Initiative.  But my platform on phobos has not been that for longer now than that had been the case.  Development of the region is done by interested individuals.  You might sponsor a base, help get people developed doing the things you want to see, and get your own repayment of that loan.

[14-Dec-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	I just think it's a bit bull to try convince the hundreds of phobos players that electronics cogc is better for everyone, while only a handful of the uber rich benefit, while not providing an alternative cogc to the way larger manu population, which would be a drop in the bucket if the "big voices" put some money together for it instead of being greedy


[14-Dec-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	it's against the majority of the players interest to have a electronics switch rn, unless there is an alternative cogc to jump of to. I just think building it is the least to do, and I don't get the reluctance or refusal from the "big voices" side.


[14-Dec-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	Now don't get me confused, I also think phobos was always destined to be electronics, that was the long road from the start. But it should be done proper, not like this.


[14-Dec-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OnlyCowardsUse**:	See i am new to this shit but I choose to start my farm here sooo


[14-Dec-21 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OnlyCowardsUse**:	oops


[14-Dec-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	check out Harmonia (ZV-896b)!


[14-Dec-21 10:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	it's our local farming planet


[14-Dec-21 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	phobos isn't too suited for agriculture, but one could make it work if they *want* to


[14-Dec-21 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	Harmonia has the proper infrastructure and stats for it though :)


[14-Dec-21 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	What is "like this" - all i'm doing is making people aware that we can and should switch to Electronics.  When enough people are ready, the votes would swing the cogc


[14-Dec-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It's not an absolute, it's not like I'm going to instantly swap everyone over


[14-Dec-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	like this is without providing an alternative for them to go to


[14-Dec-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	^^


[14-Dec-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	And i strongly disagree that it only helps the uber rich


[14-Dec-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It's in everyones best interest here to stand up electronics production


[14-Dec-21 10:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Even small players.


[14-Dec-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	is it though?


[14-Dec-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Maybe they make TRN, maybe they make SAR, maybe they make a DRS


[14-Dec-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	how do the small players with a BMP benefit from it


[14-Dec-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	rn they get 25% cogc


[14-Dec-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Demolish BMP, build CLR


[14-Dec-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	yea no


[14-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	have to disagree with you on this matter :)


[14-Dec-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The money is in the drones, not the overalls


[14-Dec-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	(I can be bribed though, with a COGC on the SHY planet)


[14-Dec-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	sure but the fun is in the overalls, not the drones


[14-Dec-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Electronics isnt fun?


[14-Dec-21 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	no


[14-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	High tier workforce isnt fun?


[14-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Pioneers are fun?


[14-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	its the most tedious of building trees


[14-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	high tier is fun, but electronics isnt


[14-Dec-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I beg all to consider the potential if Phobos & the Antares CX became an electronics trade hub.


[14-Dec-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Making things to sell to the MM is emphatically *against* "everyone's interest".  It makes us all poorer.


[14-Dec-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Making electronics that people want and will come to Antares to trade for is great.


[14-Dec-21 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Still, the electronics swap is still a significant fraction of a base-decay away.  If you're farming Phobos, you should really consider moving now.  If you're manufacturing on Phobos, go ahead and continue, but don't repair.  And if you're expecting to get high-tier workforces on Phobos, maybe put some consumables into the University, eh?  Run against the current governor on a platform of increased taxes for increased tier support.

**rain9441**:	Hello Phobonions!  It looks like the Electronics CoGC is getting more traction.  I would like to step up to the podium again and lobby for everyone to look into Electronics as the future of Phobos!


[07-Jan-22 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	With SIO here and AL next door, this planet makes a very idea llocation to make Transistors and Wafers, a huge part of electronics.  Manufacturing is good, and has been good, but doesn't necessarily have to be on Phobos because it isnt using any natural resources.


[07-Jan-22 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Electronics can be an amazing industry to get into as Drones are of significant value.


[07-Jan-22 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The drone frames are easily made in Deimos.  We can import POW from (anywhere) quite easily.


[07-Jan-22 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	Gold is abundant and easily purchased from the market at MM buy rates, which gives us easy access to make PCB


[07-Jan-22 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The electronics CoGC will make Phobos a powerhouse for drone and SAR production as well as an amazingly efficient producer of WAI later on.


[07-Jan-22 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The more players making drones here, the more engineers we employ.  The more engineers we employ, the more scientists we make.

[07-Jan-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yaro111**:	I can change when you want :) as for now more profitable for me is manu cogc, as I produce LOG :) we plan move all PPF, BMP and WPL to ant c this month, but our  bottleneck is PPF ;)


[07-Jan-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yaro111**:	after change cogc to electronics


[07-Jan-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yaro111**:	but I think it should be solved in one week


[07-Jan-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

To ensure that our scientist can make some nerdy friends and that they all stay happy, I've posted some donation requests to help fund MicroHeadphones for the Library and Art Gallery.  Each donation will provide 10 sets of headphones, which is 3 days of upkeep at the Gallery, and 6 days at the Library!

**alucard998**:	It's time for another round of community fundraising for the Library and Art Gallery digital devices! We continue to be plagued by a rash of teenage delinquency, with patrons checking out and then "losing" the microheadphones. Who can blame them, these things are pretty spiffy! But we need to buy more. Each water bottle purchased from our sponsors, available on the local market will cover 3 days of headphones, at the rate these kids are swiping them.

**ManoftheSea**:	When a governor flexes his (or her) power...


[24-Jan-22 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Yeah, I lowered taxes on manufacturing and raised them on electronics.  I believe, at max taxes on electronics, it could cost almost 150 AIC per day to run an electronics building.


[24-Jan-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	That makes it hard(er) for the smaller companies to run electronics - although admittedly it seems like most electronic jobs run for an age and a half


[24-Jan-22 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	We most want to shield the new players at the expense of the experienced ones. I think this accomplishes that.

**ManoftheSea**:	"harder to run electronics"?  There are zero pioneer electronics.  The EDM makes RAD (sell price 6k) in 5 hours - which means the tax adds 30 AIC to that. or 0.5% to the cost.  Other electronics have similar prices.  60 SWF a day, at 100/u - would need to be 103 to absorb taxes.


[24-Jan-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	But at the same time, the CoGC is reducing the expense of feeding settlers and technicians.  I don't think the max taxes are going to be at all meaningful to anyone capable of running electroncs.  Particularly not compared to the support they're donating to allow POPI to grow higher tier populations (shoutout to Alucard, thanks)


[24-Jan-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Domicius, do you feel like the taxes are going to cause you a hardship?  I'm willing to talk actual numbers with you in private.


[24-Jan-22 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	I'm for the electronics taxes to cover the COGC.  I just wish we could set all the other industries to 0 because they're still probably generating a significant portion of the tax money at 10 AIC/day

**rain9441**:	Did you already do another campaign


[15-Feb-22 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	If not, we should get recommendations from PiBoy and/or someone who can assess best value


[15-Feb-22 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	It looks like we got 4 scientists from education, which is 1.17% of engineers.  That's a 0.013 to 0.016 coefficient for 3 UNI and 1 LIB.  We should get 5-6 sci next week.


[15-Feb-22 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**rain9441**:	The engineer growth is due to the 3 UNIs being on.


[16-Feb-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	We got 2.4% of technicians growing into engineers each day.  We should expect about 100/week.


[16-Feb-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rain9441**:	The culture% is going to plummit, which will cause engineer happiness to go way down and reduce education effect as it grows

[16-Feb-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ManoftheSea**:	Culture is down because there are no contributions to the art gallery.


[16-Feb-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Feb-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	My platform has been to spend tax money on supporting the CoGC (though I don't control the category to which it applies) and Health and Safety (which keep our Pioneers and Settlers available).  I have not been spending on higher tiers, until supporting the creation of scientists with the Atlas update.

**ManoftheSea**:	oh no.  It is better to extract on Deimos - they get 4x the ALO per EXT.  And ALO->AL is the same as FEO->FE, but AL can make lfabs too.


[22-Feb-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DLR**:	smelting SI should be viable on phobos.


[22-Feb-22 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Deimos is certainly a better metallurgy planet, though. The best one in the whole game I think. Smelters are expensive and efficiency goes a long way. The only benefit to doing it on phobos is the easy SIO extraction.


[22-Feb-22 11:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	@Fairone if you are going to commit to EXT+SME here on Phobos (some would certainly advise against doing this) another thing you might consider is to add 1 COL and 1 INC. This will provide oxygen and carbon which will add a lot of versatility and lower operating costs for your smelting.


[22-Feb-22 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Also, these buildings are all considered resource extraction, so the EXT, COL, and INC would all benefit from the resource extraction experts.


[22-Feb-22 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	For clarity, the smelter is a metallurgy building and does not benefit from resource extraction experts. Only metallurgy experts.

[17-Mar-22 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	But yes, it's election time again.  My Pro license expires in 4 days, and you have to be paid to be a governor.  Thus, I will be ineligible.  We need someone to hold the role, if to do nothing else than run either education or festivities programs.

**Yang_Mills**:	Hello ! I tried to understand why the happiness of ENG and SCI on Phobos crushed to one digits with the last POPR (number 58). It was actually gradually eroding since report 53. So I had to dig a bit into how happiness works in PrUn. For this I relied on the PrUn community derived guide on mechanics. https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/

https://pct.fnar.net/population-infrastructure/
Population Infrastructure - PrUn Community Derived Information
Community derived data & formulas from the game Prosperous Universe


[12-Apr-22 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	The key thing is that there are two types of happiness. The first type is the true happiness which depends on the unemployement/open jobs and need fulfilment during the week. This one is a hidden variable, not displayed anywhere. The second type is the average happiness. This is the one displayed. It's a weighted average of the ture happiness over the past 5 weeks. On top of that there are governor programs, Planetary festivities, that ad a constant value to the average happiness. But their effect is only for one week, no longer term effects. So because of the way the average happiness ingame is computed, there is a 5-week inertia to it.  It tried to infer from the date the value of the true happiness. Let's take the example of SCI. I assumed that up to and including POPR 52, the true happiness was, just as the average happiness, around 90 percent. From this I got that on POPR 53, the true happiness was about 67 percent, and starting from POPR 54 it crushed to one digits, like almost 0


[12-Apr-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Because of the way that average happiness is computed, we have seen the full effect of this only with the last POPR 58. But the « fundamentals » (true happiness) were already disastrous since POPR 54.


[12-Apr-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Actually POPR 53 is exactly when the Advanced education program III was enacted. Due to it, the number of SCI exploded from 226 to 785. So starting from the next POPR 54, there was a very high unemployment for SCI (74,5 percent). It crushed the hidden true happiness to one digits already on that week.

**Yang_Mills**:	Greetings to all new players on Phobos! You chose this planet because the commodity exchange is in the same system, didn't you? You actually made a mistake! Phobos is by far not the most profitable starter planet. It is much better to start as a metalllurgist on Deimos and produce AL (aluminium), as a carbon farmer on Harmonia and produce C (carbon), or as a victualiser on Harmonia. Profits will be greater. Deimos and Harmonia are planets in the nearby systems, on or two jumps away from the CX (commodity exchange). But don't worry. You can just restart and set up your company anew. Use the COLIQ command.

[20-Apr-22 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	I believe Hephaestus is not proposed as a starter planet when one creates a company.


[20-Apr-22 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	you can still start on Phobos and fly there before creating your base


[20-Apr-22 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	I believe that there isn't much demand for the SIO. Don't know how profitable it is.


[20-Apr-22 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	selling SIO on CX is fine. Using LST to make MCG is better. Smelting it into GL for construction is also good


[20-Apr-22 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ManoftheSea**:	Well, it looks like there's a wave of new players.  I am sad to tell you this, new players, but Phobos is not where you want to be.  If you want to farm or make carbon, go to harmonia.  If you want to make drinking water, Etherwind is the place to be.  If you are a manufacturer, you want Hephastus.  Metallurgy or Construction is Deimos.

**Yang_Mills**:	Manofthesea, that's what I tried to explain earlier today.


[20-Apr-22 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Phobos will get an excess of bases with low productivity. Many will be disappointed with their income and quit the game after a couple of weeks. If only they have chosen a different planet.


[20-Apr-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	And the economy of Antares needs more carbon (Harmonia) and more aluminium (Deimos).

**Yang_Mills**:	Greetings to all new players who settled on Phobos ! You probably chose this planet because it's in the same system as the commodity exchange, it's fertile, it offers some oxygen, water and iron ore. Well, I have to disappoint you. You made a mistake and fell into a trap. Phobos is by far NOT  the most profitable starter planet in the Antares area. It's not that fertile, it doesn't have that much oxygen and offers very little water and iron ore. Deimos in the neighbouring system is much better for metallurgy, the best planet for this in the whole universe actually. It has a lot of oxygen, plenty of aluminium ore, and aluminium is in much higher demand than iron. Deimos also receives a metallurgy bonus from its Chamber of Global Commerce. Harmonia, a planet two jumps away, is much better suited for carbon farmers and victualisers. It's more fertile, has much more water, and its Chamber of Global Commerce provides an agriculture bonus.


[20-Apr-22 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	You won't make much money as a starting player on Phobos. I would recommend you to liquidate your company and start a new one as a metallurigst on Deimos, or as a carbon farmer or victualiser on Harmonia. To restart, use the COLIQ command.


[20-Apr-22 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	DON'T START ON PHOBOS! IT'S BAD!

**Scorus**:	As others are trying to tell you badly, Phobos can be challenging as a starting planet. If you are wanting to do metallurgy, then Deimos is a much better planet for you! If you want to be a carbon farmer or victualist, then Harmonia is much better! The discord channel is a great place to ask for advice from veterans.

**DLR**:	My first act is to start the planetary festivities III program to increase happiness across all workforces. Also, in light of the massive amount of new players, we will be improving basic planet infrastructure this week.

**IgnorantC**:	Am I locked to the traits I picked or am I free to explore the game?


[22-Apr-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IgnorantC**:	guess by locked I mean it's very inefficient


[22-Apr-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	you are free to choose whatever you want, including inefficient stuff


[22-Apr-22 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	and you can always liquidate (COLIQ) and restart with different starting options, but there is a cooldown on it


[22-Apr-22 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IgnorantC**:	Good to know didn't realize was an option, cooldown as in I won't be able to liquidate again for a period?


[22-Apr-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	yes: 3 days for 2nd one, 21 days for 3rd one


[22-Apr-22 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	unless rules changed


[22-Apr-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IgnorantC**:	It's okay as long as it doesn't stop me playing.


[22-Apr-22 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**IgnorantC**:	I like the complexity here, little worried about being forced into a subscription.


[22-Apr-22 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	it depends how much you want to expand


[22-Apr-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	there are some hard limits, like number of bases and active ships at the same time


[22-Apr-22 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	some quality of life things like recurring orders


[22-Apr-22 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	and mainly being able to trade on local markets


[22-Apr-22 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Mumzhar**:	also, you don't lose all perks when subscription expires


[22-Apr-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Blinder**:	Hey new players, please read the above explenations about this planet. it's far from suited for a starter planet. please consider COLIQ and start on a different planet so that you wount get discouraged and quit the game after few weeks


[24-Apr-22 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	i'll coppy and paste it here for your convenience:


[24-Apr-22 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	[OOG] Yang_Mills Greetings to all new players who settled on Phobos ! You probably chose this planet because it's in the same system as the commodity exchange, it's fertile, it offers some oxygen, water and iron ore. Well, I have to disappoint you. You made a mistake and fell into a trap. Phobos is by far NOT the most profitable starter planet in the Antares area. It's not that fertile, it doesn't have that much oxygen and offers very little water and iron ore. Deimos in the neighbouring system is much better for metallurgy, the best planet for this in the whole universe actually. It has a lot of oxygen, plenty of aluminium ore, and aluminium is in much higher demand than iron. Deimos also receives a metallurgy bonus from its Chamber of Global Commerce. Harmonia, a planet two jumps away, is much better suited for carbon farmers and victualisers. It's more fertile, has much more water, and its Chamber of Global Commerce provides an agriculture bonus.


[24-Apr-22 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	04/20 07:56 PM [OOG] Yang_Mills You won't make much money as a starting player on Phobos. I would recommend you to liquidate your company and start a new one as a metallurigst on Deimos, or as a carbon farmer or victualiser on Harmonia. To restart, use the COLIQ command. 04/20 07:56 PM [OOG] Yang_Mills DON'T START ON PHOBOS! IT'S BAD!


[24-Apr-22 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	04/20 09:20 PM [ANTS] Scorus As others are trying to tell you badly, Phobos can be challenging as a starting planet. If you are wanting to do metallurgy, then Deimos is a much better planet for you! If you want to be a carbon farmer or victualist, then Harmonia is much better! The discord channel is a great place to ask for advice from veterans.

**Blinder**:	[GSO] ManoftheSea Well, it looks like there's a wave of new players. I am sad to tell you this, new players, but Phobos is not where you want to be. If you want to farm or make carbon, go to harmonia. If you want to make drinking water, Etherwind is the place to be. If you are a manufacturer, you want Hephastus. Metallurgy or Construction is Deimos.

**DLR**:	Hello Citizens of Phobos, please observe this 7-days notice on a tax raise for pioneers.


[24-Apr-22 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	The upcoming Phobos population report is expected to show a very large increase in pioneer population.   We predict that the comfort level of all workforces could fall badly in response. This would be very bad for our economy, which has benefitted from Phobos being a high tech electronics planet. We have already worked very hard to protect our scientist and engineer workforces from low comfort, which makes them flee the planet.  Despite this, we understand pioneers are necessary, and also need to avoid a situation where we have a pioneer and settler shortage on Phobos. That could lead to an even worse problem.


[24-Apr-22 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	In response, OOG is urgently producing supplies to upgrade the PAR, and committing future POL time to supplying the DEC for this building. The cost for this upgrade is estimated to be 600k AIC at market rates, and in reality closer to 350k AIC as OOG will be able to supply some of it at low cost. Also, the DEC contributions could add up to 60k AIC weekly expense if fully funded.


[24-Apr-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	If pioneer populations stabilize within range of our infrastructure comfort capacity, we will be able to lower taxes again in the future.  Without further ado, The new proposed tax structure for pioneers:


[24-Apr-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Low fees (15 AIC) for Resource Extraction, Food Industries, and Construction.


[24-Apr-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Medium fees (20 AIC) for Fuel Refining, Chemistry, and Metallurgy


[24-Apr-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	High fees (25 AIC) for Agriculture and Manufacturing


[24-Apr-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Additionally for higher tier workforces, we are increasing the tax rate of electronics, because the profit margin is extremely high and the field benefits greatly from Phobos infrastructure.


[24-Apr-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Technician Electronics: 90 AIC -> 100 AIC


[24-Apr-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Engineer Electronics: 90 AIC -> 125 AIC


[24-Apr-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Scientist Electronics: 90 AIC -> 175 AIC


[24-Apr-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	This will be put into effect in one week, pending slight adjustments after we are able to analyze the next POPR report


[24-Apr-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	thank you for your time, and feel free to discuss here and on the UFO discord server. I am also available in direct message, but am generally very busy and sometimes do not respond quickly.

**DLR**:	Hello people of Phobos, new and old! I am happy to announce what I interpret as a very positive population report. The steep downturn in pioneer numbers should be read as some new bases being cleaned up, and 2400 pioneers educating into settlers.


[04-May-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	I think at this point, it is safe to run an education program next week to drag the population curve further towards scientists.

**alucard998**:	Uh... money


[19-May-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	@allocater you're thinking about this in a wrong way. every single day, millions to billions of currency are getting deleted due to consumables and building degradation. there has to be MM to inject money to the game. also, nobody can play in a vacume, so the demand for consumables and fabs (at least) that Aramed injects to the market, makes other players get in to the food production or whatever.


[19-May-22 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	just wondering, is there a corp with an HQ on this planet?


[19-May-22 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	I was just joking, but also we if look at somebody producing money, we have to check if somebody is destroying money balances it out


[19-May-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Corps can't build HQ on a faction planet; it has to be outside of faction space.


[19-May-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Etherwind and Griffonstone have them


[19-May-22 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	so inflation is your fault!


[19-May-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	I stand corrected as in Discord: can build Corp HQ in faction, not on original starter planets.


[19-May-22 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	are there non-original starter planets inside faction space?


[19-May-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	I think so. Is Nike one?


[19-May-22 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	nike is not a starter planet

[09-Jun-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I wanna ask you guys which buildings you guys run


[09-Jun-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jun-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I kinda wanna do SE -> EDC


[09-Jun-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Just gotta bring in consumables


[09-Jun-22 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Drones are tempting but it looks really hard to do, especially since I can't dedicate any more planets to Phobos


[09-Jun-22 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

**WhosRodrix**:	I don't know much about shortages and populations


[09-Jun-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I'm trying to learn up on it


[09-Jun-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	How is there a shortage?


[09-Jun-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	ATM there are 763 missing ENG on Phobos


[09-Jun-22 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	But we should get more every week right?


[09-Jun-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	should, yes. the gov is working on that


[09-Jun-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	look al the popr


[09-Jun-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	From what I understand, we need to keep the Population Infrastructure up to get more ENG every week?


[09-Jun-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	yes but either way it'll probably take 4-5 weeks just to close the gap, and that even without new demand


[09-Jun-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	welp


[09-Jun-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Not much I can do about it


[09-Jun-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Guess I'll wait


[09-Jun-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinder**:	just for your consideration..

**DLR**:	Hello Phobos, I have just read the conversation about ENG shortages. Rest assured we are working on this.


[13-Jun-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	This is a new development, and I think is a result of multiple people developing software buildings.


[14-Jun-22 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DLR**:	Regardless, the best way to approach this is to educate from our unemployed settler and technician worker base, while maintaining the infrastrucutre for low tier workers to ensure that we dont have shortages.

[18-Jul-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Have to ship from the CX at Antares Station, unless you have a PRO license, which means you can buy them on the planet if you can find a supplier.


[18-Jul-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Also if you have a PRO license you can pay someone to ship it from CX instead of doing it yourself, which gets it there pretty quickly in my experience.


[18-Jul-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jul-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NoahTheDragon**:	at least when starting out?


[29-Jul-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Only if you run recipes which finish quickly and if you're BASIC or TRIAL


[29-Jul-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	You seem to be TRIAL so if you notice your production lines are running out of orders quickly then increasing the order size might be a lifesaver IF your shipping routines allow for it


[29-Jul-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	You just started, so don't worry about too much

**NoahTheDragon**:	anyone need help shipping stuff?


[29-Jul-22 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Unfortunately you won't be able to help people with shipping stuff because you are unrated [you don't have PRO/BASIC, which costs a bit of $]


[29-Jul-22 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**LegalTaxEvasion**:	Does increasing the Pioneers satisfaction also increase the production rates and population?


[25-Aug-22 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	It increases only the popultaion


[25-Aug-22 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	more precisely the migration speed.


[25-Aug-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	It does not increase the production rates.


[25-Aug-22 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Sorry, I ment the hapiness at plantary level.


[25-Aug-22 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	As for satisfaction inside a base, it increases the production rates but not the population.


[25-Aug-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Satisfaction per base: increases production rates.


[25-Aug-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Happiness per planet: increases migration.


[25-Aug-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LegalTaxEvasion**:	Cool. Satisfaction per base: Increased production. And when you say per planet, thats the population pool that effects the other bases too, right?


[25-Aug-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Yes.


[25-Aug-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	There is a planetary happiness level that you can see in the population report.


[25-Aug-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LegalTaxEvasion**:	Great. Thank you, I just got some back to base to test it and realized I could have asked instead of guessing.


[25-Aug-22 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Click on the population number and you will see the report.


[25-Aug-22 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	The happiness level affects the planetary labor pool.


[25-Aug-22 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LegalTaxEvasion**:	Oh cool


[25-Aug-22 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LegalTaxEvasion**:	Is there ever a good reason to lose global population?


[25-Aug-22 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	The planetary population needs upkeep.


[25-Aug-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	If the excess of population is too large compared to the opne jobs,


[25-Aug-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	then the happiness of the population will decrease beacause of the unemployment.


[25-Aug-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	Wich might trigger emigration (migration off the planet).


[25-Aug-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	And the population will decrease.


[25-Aug-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	This is kind of a self-regulating system.


[25-Aug-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**WhiteSaturnMath**:	guys how do i buy resources or get started?


[26-Aug-22 10:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	you will want to fly one of your ships to the Antares Commodity Exchange, and then purchase the goods there. You can find the CX (commodity exchange) on the left toolbar under CXL (which lists all CX in the universe). They are all somewhere in space, so you need to travel there. However there is also rentable Storage on site, which would allow purchasing (and selling if you have goods there) without a ship present.


[26-Aug-22 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	For flying there, just type "ANT" into the flight destination, then select the "Antares Station", which is a space station the CX is found on.

**LegalTaxEvasion**:	@WhiteSaturnMath there's also a few good youtube videos worth checking out. Taught me a lot. There's quite a few ways to make money as well.

**Tikigawd**:	Right... so just starting out, got my farms making some HCP, then incinerators turning that into Carbon. Grabbed another 5 days worth of Pioneer resources and have a ship en route to go collect it all.... Guess we'll see how it all goes in 12-24 hours


[30-Aug-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tikigawd**:	Somewhat inefficient to have the ship collecting the Pioneer resources before my incinerators are done and my ship can haul Carbon on the first trip, but would rather risk fluffing up sending a empty ship incorrectly then one filled with 24 hours of goods production

**jelutz77**:	Sounds good. That's why you start with so much fuel, I think.


[31-Aug-22 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Just be aware that the carbon farming start is exceptionally slow.


[31-Aug-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Oryinn**:	When considering shipping contracts and fuel costs, is there a way to find out multi stop fuel costs?


[31-Aug-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Oryinn**:	Or the costs of a ship to fly from point A to B when the ship is at C currently I guess


[31-Aug-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	use the BLU, and trace out the takeoff, landing from A -> B, then again B ->C


[31-Aug-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	it'll get you somewhat close.


[31-Aug-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If B is on the flight path of A -> C, then just triple the landing SF usage that you see on A -> B, and you'll be within the error of margin


[31-Aug-22 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Oryinn**:	Sorry Im brand spanking new but what is BLU


[31-Aug-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Yang_Mills**:	Dear citizens of Phobos,


[03-Sep-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	I am Yang_Mills, the CEO of Baryonic Technologies (BARY) and member of the Ooga Booga Capital Management corporation (OOG). On behalf of my corporation, I run for the governorship on Phobos. The current governor, DLR, cannot run this time because of real life duties.


[03-Sep-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	I started in PrUn 263 days ago as a modest carbon farmer on Phobos. Now I run an industrial empire stretching over 8 planets. But I kept an emotional attachment to Phobos. I also have a lot of experience in upkeeping the POPI on Phobos, since DLR has already delegated to me part of this task in the past. Thanks to the support of OOG, I will be able to keep the need fulfilment of pops at a high level.


[03-Sep-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	I intend to keep the tax levels on Phobos as they are know. I will also ensure the growth of engineers and scientists on Phobos. For our corporation, the OOG, the high tier workforce on Phobos is of critical importance. Indeed, we have a significant electronics production here.


[03-Sep-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Yang_Mills**:	So vote for me for a prosperous and high tech Phobos !

**BynceHb**:	What's the profit in producing infrastructure upkeep stuff? Like if i make security uniforms, don't i just donate it to the infrastructure?


[14-Sep-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The profit comes in maybe tax revenue, either by being in the same corp as the governor or by selling the product to someone that is, but mostly it comes by having enough workers to run your production lines at full efficiency.


[14-Sep-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BynceHb**:	So whoever donates more to the infrastructure gets more workforce from the common pool?


[14-Sep-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	No, the workforce is doled out equally at POPR, but someone needs to donate the upkeep, otherwise there won't be enough workers for everyone.


[14-Sep-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BynceHb**:	Oh i see. I bet governors just produce this stuff by themself, judging by the market


[14-Sep-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Yes, items that only get used for upkeep tend to be too slow velocity to sell on the market and most governors are advanced enough to make it themselves or are members of a corporation that is or they make special agreements to buy it directly from producers.


[14-Sep-22 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BynceHb**:	Alright, I see, thank you


[14-Sep-22 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	It could also be that you're maintaining the facility for a 25% bonus to productivity on a planet by yourself, or are running a huge base at a big savings per quantity.

**Emperyan**:	Like a random lotto paid for with rep... just faction rep you figure or global too? I'm just curious, not about to deliberately bork missions

**Archiel**:	I am deliberately stealing my faction contracts. You can look at the mass/volume ratio and figure out what's in it before you decide.

**Onun73**:	Hi!


[23-Jan-23 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Onun73**:	How to buy resources to start constrctions?


[23-Jan-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lexip**:	You have to travel to the nearby CX (Antares Station for you) you can take the fuel from the second ship (that you won't use for a while) to buy extra


[23-Jan-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Onun73**:	I have sent the ship to CX. It takes almost 9 hours to arrive. And then?


[23-Jan-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	In the mean time, find what resources you need on CX and start buying. You can load them when you arrive.


[23-Jan-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Onun73**:	Ok. Thanks!


[23-Jan-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You can rent a warehouse on the CX or just let them go into overflow contracts and pick them up when you get there

[26-Jan-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Onun73**:	Doesn't work


[26-Jan-23 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Look at the contract after arrival. Does it need you to press the Fulfill button after landing, or does it automatically fulfill when you land?


[27-Jan-23 06:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Onun73**:	I have landed and the fulfill buton is not available

**Churaviis**:	OOG and I have been providing a ton of upkeep items, some of which require complex production chains. I've also been unable to keep up with the increasing demand for engineers and so need to upgrade some of the infrastructure for them. That's also why I only increased taxes for engineer and scientist products since the improvements are for them.


[31-Jan-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collettiquette**:	Seems fair


[31-Jan-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I don't know have exact numbers but I do know that we've been providing far more on upkeep than we receive in taxes and I doubt that's changed even with the tax increase

**62**:	Bonjour. Quelqu’un pourrait m’expliqer en français le fonctionnement des contrats de logistiques ?


[08-Feb-23 03:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	c'est pour envoyer des choses (pardon pour mon francais)


[08-Feb-23 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	tu choisis le produit, le planete ou tu as le produit maintenent, et le planet ou tu veux le envoyer


[08-Feb-23 03:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	finalment, tu choisis le prix.


[08-Feb-23 03:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Mais il faut que tu as le license PRO pour faire des contrats


[08-Feb-23 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Si tu fais le contrat au Marche Locale, tu peux aussi choissir si les produits vont etre disposer automatiquement. Sinon, il faut que to les disposes toi meme quand le contrat est accepte


[08-Feb-23 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Finalement, le contrat cree un Paquet de livraison dans le inventoire du planete de origini (si les produits existent, evidement).


[08-Feb-23 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**62**:	Merci, mais c'est pour les contrats de l’alliance.


[08-Feb-23 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**62**:	voilà le contrat CONT 9B2QJ4G


[08-Feb-23 03:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Je ne peux pas le voir.


[08-Feb-23 03:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Mais ca doit etre la meme chose, sauf que tu choisi qui va apporter votre produits. Lui va etre le "partner"


[08-Feb-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Le "condition" c'est pour changer les valeurs de produit et le prix, le "condition" c'est le numero des jours


[08-Feb-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	parodn le "parameter" pour les jours


[08-Feb-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**62**:	ok, merci. je vais essayer


[08-Feb-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	si tu veux, envois moi quelques contrats.


[08-Feb-23 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	On peut les terminer, sans probleme. Sinon je peux apporter tes chose


[08-Feb-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**62**:	pour le moment je développe mes colonies. vu que je vais pas loin du lieu du contrat je tentes.


[08-Feb-23 04:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**62**:	je vais réfléchir pur te faire des cotrats


[08-Feb-23 04:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Ok, bon chance

**Valavingee**:	I just started, did a new order to extract iron so do i just wait the 17 hrs now?


[02-May-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Phobos isn't the best planet for extracting iron, other planets it would be quicker. Regardless, the game is a bit slow at first. You'll want to watch the tutorials on YouTube first and then plan out your next move.


[02-May-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valavingee**:	well shoot


[02-May-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valavingee**:	I see the yellow bars next to each resource in the planet info tab, im guessing the higher the bar the faster itll be?


[02-May-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Correct, there are also other factors like whether you have enough workers, whether you give them luxury consumables, the planetary COGC industry bonus and experts, all of which are explained in the tutorials


[02-May-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valavingee**:	Gotcha, def gonna check out the vids just wanted to get the basic info without going through however many minutes the vids may be

[02-May-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**themisanthropicanthropologist**:	Or just switch to silicon production


[02-May-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The price of silicon is pretty good right now and it's easy


[02-May-23 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Or you could play the SIO market by taking shipping contracts from Norwick to Antares Station, if you have a PRO license


[02-May-23 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valavingee**:	Gotcha, prob gonna move to silicon and just wait till tomorrow morning for it to finish so i can move on with the tutorial missions

[17-Jun-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	most of being in a corp is about deals and contracts, it's almost entirely pointless in free tier


[17-Jun-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gilith**:	@volkse it depends on how much fuel you burn- you can reach Antares CX in less than 4 hours with enough fuel. it also depends on orbit positions - currently it's pretty good


[23-Jun-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**untech**:	New players! Vote Manufacturing, most likely you can't participate in Electronics yet.


[01-Jul-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	Old players! Consider choosing Manufacturing for a few weeks as a supporting measure for new players :)


[01-Jul-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	New players.  consider choosing a different starting planet that already has the resources and COGC that you are looking for  :)

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	But seriously.  Old players make way to much money from the electronics GOCG to consider switching it.  If somebody wants to support new players they're better off just handing over some cash.


[01-Jul-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**untech**:	You're right about other planets, its just that onboarding tutorial sends Manufacturing people on Phobos. So I guess there's a bunch of us. We could COLIQ, if course, but it seems a bit radical. The problem is that you realize the importance of COGS only some time after you choose the planet


[01-Jul-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Definitely always recommend moving to heph


[01-Jul-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	So, to make matters more clear, here's the arrangement I had in mind:


[09-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	- I buy and ship TAI to your planet


[09-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	- You process it to TA and keep FE, which I don't care about


[09-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	- I take TA from your planet


[09-Jul-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	Ideally, I'd like your planet to be at Phobos I, but 1-2 jumps from Phobos I is ok too.


[09-Jul-23 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	And who would pay for the production costs for TA in the AML? If I remember right production costs for each TA is about 5k (only consumables/repair costs, no input materials included). That would never be covered with 1 FE you offer to keep


[09-Jul-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	And A1B is a TSH-planet, so the overall production costs on that planet are even higher than on a T1 planet


[09-Jul-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	Of course, I'll pay a fee for each TA produced

[09-Jul-23 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Jul-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	Cool!


[09-Jul-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**untech**:	I want to make SC because it has better margins than MED for my recently built CHP. Also it would give me an opportunity to play around with multistep production.


[09-Jul-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	Bunch of shipping ads posted on ANT CX to bring to Phobos if anyone has extra shipping capacity - thanks


[21-Jul-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jul-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Hmm, maxed out tonnage by mistake.. Anyone around interested in buying ALO or SIO per chance? Or maybe AL AU FE SI STL?


[21-Jul-23 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	Have you filled up all 1500t of your warehouse as well?


[21-Jul-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Yupp, grand total of 18,000 tons


[21-Jul-23 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I can offer up to 5k space if needed


[21-Jul-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	or send a WCB ship within 2h


[21-Jul-23 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	for shipping


[21-Jul-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	There are many people, including myself, that run puddlejumpers to and from Phobos regularly with extra space. Post some shipping ads and I'm sure they'll get picked up quick


[21-Jul-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If there's enough interest, I can also look into upgrading the warehouse


[21-Jul-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	It's not a regular issue, at least for me :) I just happened to fall sick for a week and barely touched Prün in the meantime


[21-Jul-23 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Took your advice on posting some shipping ads to Phobos since I have another 22 KT storage there yet to fill up


[21-Jul-23 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	picked them up, I have to refill consumables on Phobos anyway and will send the STL ship now from ANT. Can jump over to Heph afterwards


[21-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I told you


[21-Jul-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	No stress on my behalf,just happy to have some space now so production can run until my own ships visit ANT region again


[21-Jul-23 05:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	with 3 bases in ANT + CX I would always suggest to invest in a STL ship


[21-Jul-23 05:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I already have 11 ships, just need to be active and not mess up so there's one kept around


[21-Jul-23 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jul-23 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rook_Pares**:	Where would I find beginner contracts?


[29-Jul-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lehanat**:	hey I'm new here and I was wondering is it worth to just by carbon and hydrogen to make poly-ethylene or should I make something else


[01-Aug-23 04:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Eyo - depends on a lot of things, like consumables, how much fuel you burn while flying to collect, etc. Only way to be really sure is to crunch the numbers for yourself


[01-Aug-23 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Generally it's not hard to make a profit, but when starting out you either want to track down items that seem very stable or that have currently highest returns


[01-Aug-23 04:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Comes down to playstyle - If you prefer slow but steady, might want to switch planet and go for someplace with agri- or manufacturing focus , Phobos has been switched to electronics by the player base


[01-Aug-23 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If you are willing to invest more time and keep on track with the shifts of market, anywhere could work since you'd likely be switching what you focus on producing and mixing across markets for max profit initally


[01-Aug-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Aug-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Harmonia is much better, but I'm not sure if it's a starter planet.


[01-Aug-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You're welcome to farm wherever you want but Harmonia and Demeter have agricultural COGC planetary bonuses which will add much more efficiency than fertility levels, especially when combined with expert bonuses

[04-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Aug-23 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Emperyan**:	Got an efficiency question... I've got 5 electronic experts adding like 28% efficiency, full happiness and, well,  it's Phobos, but my SE production queue is only running at 73% efficiency. I'm perplexed, any thoughts?


[18-Aug-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Just open production --> new oder on SE and have a look on top for the efficiency factors, there you'll find the minus


[18-Aug-23 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I have 5 experts aswell and it should look like Engineers 100% + Production line condition 99% + electronicx experts 128% + CoGC program 125% = Overall efficiency 159%


[18-Aug-23 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	just identify the value far below 100% and you know what happened. I assume missing repairs or missing ENG

**xensored**:	establishing a fixed high price for a T1 consumable hurts a lot of new players (all new people without own RAT). I really don‘t like those MM farmers who use their mass MM money for things like that. Same story like with Niegrozny some weeks ago and the H2O market. Stupid action against new players. But good thing to remember and add Swanada and GTU to my blacklist…


[19-Aug-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	100 pioneers paying 50aic more per rat is like 200aic/day, i think they will be fine


[19-Aug-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	it also won't last forever and has the eventual effect of making more people build their own fp and drive the rat price lower than it was before the buy wall went up


[19-Aug-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Cherrybark**:	GTU is a very loosely organized group of players and haven't heard and Corp wide plans to dominate a market.  These two players seem to be enjoying a bit of mischief.  I expect the very fluid RAT market will adjust.  Perhaps sellers will learn this is a new acceptable price point.


[20-Aug-23 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	Proportionally, I think on average, newer players probably produce more rats than they consume. If that's true, then pumping the price, on average, helps newer players.

**Inforiel**:	It sounds a lot like some presumptions around the whole 'inflation' talk that's been going around - Inflation can't really be a thing in this game without actively killing it since newcomers then get forced into a niché without much choice, resulting in far fewer sticking around because frankly it's dull as hell being told to follow a narrow path.


[20-Aug-23 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And if that's considered mere 'mischief' then sure, it's just sad that it's rather likely to ruin the stage as a whole if it's kept going at length.


[20-Aug-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Has anyone considered the possibility that what Swanada is doing is not only profitable but sustainable?


[20-Aug-23 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	Yes


[20-Aug-23 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	It would take some concerted effort to counter it among RAT sellers


[20-Aug-23 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	And buyers...


[20-Aug-23 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	One effect this could have is pushing more volume through private contracts


[20-Aug-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	But the price of RAT at 9k/day for a typical base doesn't break the bank in most cases. A very slight increase in output price would cover that most of the time, so it's not high enough to "break" the game.


[20-Aug-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	So, it's in the range of financially tolerable, if on the high side. So if properly motivate, could keep it up relatively indefinetly.


[20-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	The one weakness is if this causes a shift so that there is an over supply of RAT, eventually it could drain the resources.


[20-Aug-23 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	But ... sellers would have to continuously avoid selling to him and keep a large supply just below his price


[20-Aug-23 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	At the end of the day, I suspect he can do this for as long as he wants and make bank doing it


[20-Aug-23 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	And his maintenance effort is low


[20-Aug-23 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	if the economy overproduces RA


[20-Aug-23 04:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	RAT by an appreciable amount, all it takes to move the price is people selling to swanda


[20-Aug-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	galaxy-wide daily production of RATs is 200k, WCB shipload is 10k RATs, so breaking through 100k bid barriers will take a while


[20-Aug-23 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dehzhas**:	RAT has a unique situation, it is harder to produce at scale than say DW. It's not just a shipping thing. HYF bases are expensive and you need HYF + FP to get to RAT. The HYF needs H2O and NS in, and outputs are bulky too. So, increasing RAT production quickly is difficult.


[21-Aug-23 12:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aktme**:	he's buying for 158?  @ 189k... 30M? at 158 I can profit about 4200/day/FP on RAT from him.  Thats almost as good as what I'm making on SF. Hmmm


[21-Aug-23 12:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aktme**:	6FRM/3 FP and 420 pioneers so 3 HB1s.  266 area?  So roughly 4 clusters?


[21-Aug-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aktme**:	about 50k from a full base?  Nm, too costly in area.


[21-Aug-23 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	@Ogre its not profitable lol


[21-Aug-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	it may be sustainable, depending on how much money he's willing to sink into it, but it's not profitable


[21-Aug-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If I had the liquidity, I'd do the same thing. Having to update my orders several times a day due to the constant influx of competition gets old, fast. Then again, I'm a food producer from Hortus, so I'm not really negatively affected by these shenanigans.


[21-Aug-23 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Absolutely profitable.  He is buying at 158 and selling at 159.   There is no room for someone to undercut him and the quantity is so high that it is unlikely anyone would buy him out.  Even if they do they'd be buying his stockpile at 159.  He can take his profit, wait for prices to come down then buy everyone out and do it again.


[21-Aug-23 12:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	do we believe in the holy law of supply and demand?


[21-Aug-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	and the equilibrium that results in a market price?


[21-Aug-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yes, it's fairly simple


[21-Aug-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	One guy provides all of the supply and all of the demand.


[21-Aug-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	instant equilibrium XD


[21-Aug-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	if we believe in it, then what does a higher price do? it stimulates supply and reduces demand; now sure, you can say demand is fixed, but it still stimulates supply


[21-Aug-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	so then what happens? more people make RAT and sell it than actually need RAT


[21-Aug-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	so whoever is paying this premium is just building the biggest long position on RAT anyone has seen, building stockpiles on stockpiles


[21-Aug-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	how exactly thousands of RAT in your warehouse result in profits is a mystery to me


[21-Aug-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You might think that, however there's plenty of colonies on barren planets that eat RAT like it's nothing.


[21-Aug-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	if it was profitable, trust me, I'd do it on every single good


[21-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	Please do, FireFreak  :)  I'd like to see that.


[21-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	well its not profitable


[21-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	if it wasn't the case, basic consumable prices would be headed to rock bottom since day 0.


[21-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	I dont like giving away money


[21-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	I dont understand what youre saying Roh


[21-Aug-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	supply is still going up due to a higher price


[21-Aug-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	much faster than demand


[21-Aug-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	you cant evade the fact that more people will make RAT now that RAT is more expensive ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


[21-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	It's possible that for a while, there was less rats produced each day, than was consumed. And the global stockpile of available rats (while large) was shrinking. In a situation like that, you could buy up all the rats, boost the price and keep making profit margins until production ramps up.


[21-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	yup, for a short while


[21-Aug-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	and in that case it would even be a good thing


[21-Aug-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	but this is not that


[21-Aug-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	(probably) :D


[21-Aug-23 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	I don't know the motivations of why he's doing it, but I'm fine with it. And I don't know what the consume/supply/stockpile numbers were for rats, but that is a possible scenario where the actions would be proffitable.


[21-Aug-23 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	very true


[21-Aug-23 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	I don't see any reason to believe that anything other will happen than what happened to Niegrozny. Hundreds of thousands of water (RAT in this case) in a warehouse


[21-Aug-23 12:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	(in the long term)


[21-Aug-23 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	On the production side of RAT's... there's lots and lots of FP's out there currently producing DW or COF or FIM or MEA .... that can instantly switch over to RATs. So rat production isn't the bottle neck he'd be banking on, it's agri production. That can take time to spool up.


[21-Aug-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	FRM planets aren't super plentiful, and large hyf projects are often limited by MHL availability. So I don't really see massive increases in agri production spooling up super quickly. And if it does... I'll bet that FIM goes through the roof.


[21-Aug-23 01:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	And probably Carbon would have to go up a lot too I'd think.

**yngwette**:	where do locals do their HYFing anyway? harmonia seems like a waste of """good""" FRMland


[21-Aug-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	harmonia


[21-Aug-23 10:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Demeter is for better farms


[21-Aug-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	HYFs necessaarily require extraction from a water-dense planet, or capability to ship in large amounts of the commodity, plus NS. Obviously, the former is preferable when you don't have much shipping capacity to beging with, but the latter is more tenable once you start upgrading your HQ/Fleet.


[21-Aug-23 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Depending on what you're after, a mix is pretty neat as well. I use Milliways & Nemesis for KOM, COF & a little bit of DW & RAT on the side


[21-Aug-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	To balance that need to use a somewhat odd recipe with MUS MAI & NUT though :P


[21-Aug-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yeah it depends on what you want to use "farm worlds", but once the initial cost of startup/upkeep is no longer a concern, many more planets open up as potential venues of production.


[21-Aug-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Our corps 'true farmers' mostly use fertile land for orchards


[21-Aug-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Several of the unnamed core worlds in the Antares I system are ripe for such utilization, even through they are slightly underpopulated.


[21-Aug-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	And instead use HYF on remote little blocks without any soil at all


[21-Aug-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	For their RATs and all


[21-Aug-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But Harmonia barely crosses my threshold for HYF utilization. I'd be more keen on using Phobos and Deimos for HER due to the low water requirements, and some sort of fertility being present on those worlds.


[21-Aug-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	I've got a pretty generous stretch of bases by now, Benten region has some solid fertile land winners


[21-Aug-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If you're willing to go out that way


[21-Aug-23 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohh I know, the Benten region is a very strong contender in all regards, however I don't have the shipping capacity to stretch deep into that territory.


[21-Aug-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	If you're looking for a pure HYF just 2 jumps away from Etherwind - KW-020D is an option


[21-Aug-23 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	It's set up to help supply Milliways with materials more than anything though


[21-Aug-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Sorry, guess that's actually 3 jumps


[21-Aug-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Aug-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It seems that Swaranda's RAT gambit has bitten into some flesh. concurrent orders from other large bidders has marginally increased the depth of the commodities in Moria, Hortus, and Antares


[22-Aug-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Having posted order dates on commodities would be a good addition for the future, as right now, you can't tell if the current postings are within several days, or months, of each other in duration.

**jelutz77**:	Pick something trading high volume to start, like OVE. Make it a while, make some money at it, expand until the base is full. Don't bother extracting your own stuff on this planet; try doubling production instead to speed things up. Consider moving manufacturing to Heph to take advantage of the COGC there; maybe you can find another operation for this base that can help as well at that point.


[05-Sep-23 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	And especially with manufacturing, if you're not extracting your own, watch your input and consumables costs.


[05-Sep-23 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I am also a new manufacturer on Phobos.  I've focused most of my time and money into trade though, but like the idea of having a small base so that I can have a baseline of income regardless of the economy.  Manufacturing is working out alright for me, but I've had a low rate of return compared to trading.  Is it worth switching my base over to electronics production, or would it be better to rebuild somewhere else?  I'm open to any type of production but care most about the rate of return vs investment cost.

**Archiel**:	We have an informal leadership structure


[05-Sep-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Phobos is an electronics planet (that's the way the Chamber of Global Commerce votes), but that's a very difficult starting point.


[05-Sep-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Most of the intermediates for electronics aren't sold on the CX, they are instead consumed directly and turned into governor upkeep items, like MHP, or turned into spaceship parts, which have very large complicated chains


[05-Sep-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Incidentally, OOG does offer grants to players with pro who start (or move to) antares space, so if you end up liking the game, sticking around, and getting pro, message me :)


[05-Sep-23 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	The nearby planet Hephaestus has a manufacturing COGC, so you might eventually transition to that if you are continuing manufacturing.


[06-Sep-23 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Thanks for the info Archiel.  I'll try to reach out if I ever get pro.


[06-Sep-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I'm looking for higher volume items to produce, so it sounds like electronics probably isn't for me, so I'll start working on plans to move.  I'd like to keep my base in either this system or Benten's system (the other CX I trade at),  Do you know if there are any other good options for a new player other than manufacturing in either system?

**Cherrybark**:	Insula... Etherwind, between Antares & Benten but a little closer to Benten, is a great place to make DW and every worker requires DW.  Start with balance of RIG to extract H2O and FP to process into DW.  Grow your 500 area base then consider moving FP to a new base on nearby KW-602c.  Etherwind COGC is Resource Extraction and 602 is Food Processing.

**RiseofFilth**:	And speaking as its Governor, Heph is the best Manufacturing planet out there ;)

**RiseofFilth**:	Come join us, there is never enough PE or Plastics on market


[07-Sep-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	While I wish I could say it is best start, honesty requires me to cede that to Promitor, but that is only because of permit limits on planets


[07-Sep-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	interesting, ive only just started but im focusing on smelting silicon on phobos


[07-Sep-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	ive had a look and it seems like i could make some good money importing gold ore and smelting it, so ive got some future plans i think


[07-Sep-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I started on phobos as well, but as a manufacturer. Depending on how recent, a Smelting start on deimos is generally wiser as it is a Smelting COGC. But all areas can valid starts.


[07-Sep-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	smelting as a whole is very profitable


[07-Sep-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	deimos is flooding the market with cheap aluminium which i can use to smelt silicon for the time being without having to import expensive carbon


[07-Sep-23 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	oh I wish these were the days of cheap AL... back when it was 400/u


[07-Sep-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	well its still cheaper than carbon + oxygen at least


[07-Sep-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	strangely true


[07-Sep-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	inefficient for sure, given the extra production costs, but true. Just goes to show how excess C prices are atm


[07-Sep-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	any idea why carbon is so expensive now? lack of supply or what?

[07-Sep-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Yep. Shortages. Thing is, carbon requires whole farms to produce, plus a RES planet to do it on (generally, for efficiency, but not required)


[07-Sep-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	So you need water(RES Planet) -> Farms(AGRI Planet) -> INCs (RES planet)


[07-Sep-23 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Not a lot of good setups for this when most people would rather use their farms to make RATs or other upkeep products that are expensive atm

[07-Sep-23 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Atm, the big paring is Harmonia and Nascent in Antares (this region we are in)


[07-Sep-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Grow on harmonia and send to Nascent for INCing


[07-Sep-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	find your water locally or import


[07-Sep-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Roh**:	meh, I'd argue that you really don't have shortages.


[07-Sep-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	most commodity markets here have no price ceilings, along with most of the agri-export listings being surplus markets. You essentially get a intermediary commodity market which relies on price averages from subsidiary markets which are "made-up", and it leads to not only made-up margins, but also to margin-hoarding on the ask orders at the CX.


[07-Sep-23 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	if there was an actual shortage, you'd be hard pressed to find any C at any ask rates, via either the CXes, or the LMs.

[22-Sep-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	A private contract is a contract sent directly to someone and avoids the LM altogether


[22-Sep-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	A related question I've been wondering is how most people network to find people to send contracts to. Do they usually just ask in the global chat?


[22-Sep-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	If you don't have a specific person with whom you want to trade the put an ad up where everyone can see it, on the LM


[22-Sep-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Taxes already do not pay for all the upkeep OOG and I provide. I'm also certain that taxes aren't a large percentage of the value of what you make here.


[28-Sep-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	wait so you subsidise the planet out of your own pocket? for free?


[28-Sep-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	thats crazy generous


[28-Sep-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	though i suppose if it helps your own production here as well then its worth it


[28-Sep-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	What I subsidize is pocket change compared to the cost of not having enough workers for even a week. Phobos is an integral part of many complex production chains for OOG so we prefer to overpay to minimize that risk.


[28-Sep-23 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Sell all your FTL fuel and most of your STL fuel and use it to buy another production building in whatever industry you're specializing in


[02-Oct-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WiredSlumber**:	i see this planet is bonused for electronics, i assume that is more complex production


[02-Oct-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Yes, electronics is not recommended for new players as there are no low tier production buildings and everything else is low volume and doesn't sell much on the CX. That does free you up to pursue whatever industry you want


[02-Oct-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WiredSlumber**:	Are there any products I could be making with BMP that would be helpful in electronics manufacturing


[02-Oct-23 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WiredSlumber**:	Also is this planet focused on electronics because of silicon ore on it, is it worthwhile to mine that here


[02-Oct-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Phobos is super close to the CX so just focus on what you can sell there for the most profit. You'll need to do some math to figure out what that is and it will change based on many different factors. For example, PE is expensive but so is the carbon needed to make it.


[02-Oct-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	you can take up any industry you like, there are no restrictions. The industry you picked when you started gives you the basics for that industry but most people will try several as they advance before settling on their preferences

[16-Oct-23 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	well, different materials require different times. But in general, you set stuff up and then you wait. I hear the game gets more involved once you have more bases. I'm a CX/contracts trader though, so the pace of PrUn is quite different for me than for producers.


[16-Oct-23 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**jelutz77**:	The only things that happen with a starting package are that you get 2 experts in a particular field for your first base, and it selects the fabs for particular buildings for that specialty. Otherwise, you can grow as you wish. 2 experts don't even take long to get. However, if you're really behind because you have the fabs for the wrong buildings and your cash is invested improperly for what you now want to do, or something, you can COLIQ to start over.

**Volixit**:	Hello, new dude here. I placed an order for 20 units of water but I'm a bit confused as to how I go about actually getting it. Do I have to wait for it to be shipped or something?


[18-Oct-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You will need to send a ship to the CX to go get it, if you don't have a warehouse there then it will be in a contract (CONT on the left screen) You should start with a small amount of all the inputs you need


[18-Oct-23 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Insula_Crisium**:	Are any of you newer players with extra ships interested in regular shipping contracts?

[19-Oct-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	IIRC you'd have to have PRO or Basic to accept the contracts. I ship product regularly between Benten and Antares stations. The contract would give you the product and a certain amount of time to get it to the other station, then I would pay a set fee for the service.


[19-Oct-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Right now I have 14 shipments that need to go from Benten to Antares. I'm working on finding some from Antares to Benten, so that you don't have to fly back empty, but that one's harder.

**masonwater**:	just looking at production values, it seems like im not making any money from the profesion i had first picked without knowing anything about the game


[20-Oct-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Volixit**:	Any pro tips for metallurgy? I just started and making steel seems to me the most viable option for me right now but even that just barely goes over breaking even after you factor in fuel cost and consumables. Am I missing something?


[20-Oct-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Volixit**:	Plus the cost of buying carbon. One unit of carbon is practically dead even with the price of steel.


[20-Oct-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	yeah, the cost of carbon is high in Antares space for some reason.  I'm not really sure why tbh.


[20-Oct-23 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Volixit**:	How is carbon produced?


[20-Oct-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I just know the basics- plants are incinerated


[20-Oct-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Oct-23 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-23 01:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Pretty good.  Market's a bit slow for us producing rations, but that's the life of a farmer I guess.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	As far as I'm aware, manufacturer's typically import their resources at the start, so you might need to do a bit of digging on the market to find something profitable.  I'll see what I can find.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	There's a large market for PE right now, though the cost of carbon is a bit on the high side.  You'll still make about 600 credits per work order.  That's option 1 that immediately sticks out.  Give me a few more minutes to find some other options as well.  Can never hurt to have options.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	There's MCGs which will bring in about 687 per batch.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	There is one more, but I'm hesitant to say it on a public channel for fear that the opportunity will disappear when the bigger companies take notice.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Thanks for the info. For PE and MCGs, is the cargo space factored into your number? I read that fuel is a big cost in the beginning.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Those two items are meant to be transferred easily.  It's less an issue of cargo space and more an issue of how long between shipments to market.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	PEs are only .01 t and .01 m, so you can fit 50,000 on your starting ship.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	for reference you make them in batches of 200.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Okay, I think I will go with PE then.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	MCGs weigh .24t and have .1 m so they're limited by weight. you can carry 2,083 of them.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	If you're worried about fuel costs, then try doing what I do and pick up a shipment contract to fill in the excess space.  They often cover the price of transport and can even just give you fuel outright.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Okay.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	I typically try to make a trip each week to make sure I cash in those contracts. It adds up fast early on.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Is it worthwhile to collect resources (rig, extractor, collector)?


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	In the early game, buying prefabs


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	eventually.  depends on how you want to manage your company really.  No "one size fits all" sort of deal with this game.  I will say though, this sector always has a market for carbon and silicon, so it could be worth investing if you have the cash, if only to save on some of the cost.  I personally recommend carbon, since it is a major factor in the cost of your PE.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Though, now that I say that... I suppose in your case that would just be an incinerator to save on worker space.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	All in all depends on the resource.


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I think I will get a rig to help with farming


[04-Nov-23 01:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	That will overall save you some money on production costs.  It does take a bit of cash to start up so be ready for that.


[04-Nov-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I see.


[04-Nov-23 01:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	that will probably save you about 400 per carbon, if you just use the incinerator, or nearly 500 if your willing to set up the whole chain. Keep in mind, that's in materials per work order.  Accounting for rations and drinking water... probably savings of 250 per work order.


[04-Nov-23 01:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Still, adds up.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	However, a word of warning, a lot of manufacturers make the mistake of trying to control the means of productions for everything, and forget to calculate the cost of feeding the workers and setting up the facilities and end up bankrupting themselves.  A calculator and patience will be your best friends in this game.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	That's why I mentioned carbon, due to the massive discrepancy between the price of production and the price of buying from the market.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Hmm... do you use spreadsheets to keep track of all these prices?


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Not yet, though I do plan on setting them up soon.  At the moment I check the prices directly then account for roughly what offers will still be open in a week's time.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	It takes about 5 or 6 minutes between each price check.  That's how I figured out it roughly takes 60 credits per ration that I make entirely from parts I source myself.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	That's a rough calculations based on weekly production, fuel expenses per trip, the price of basic water (which I source for my rigs) and subtract the rations consumed in the process.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Are all transactions between players, or are some provided by the game?


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	If you open the order book and see a market maker entry with an infinite number of orders, that is the game provided one which helps structure the market.  Then the faction contracts are also the game.  Everything else is players.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Got it. Anything else I should know? I've been looking for a game like this for a while. Thinking of designing my own space trading game as well.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	I can't really think of anything else at the moment.  If you ever need any help, there's this chat or the global one, though the global one might not be relevant to our commodity exchange.


[04-Nov-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Nov-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ElDonad**:	Hello people of the galaxy ! A small question, the guide specifies that in the CXP panel the "traded" is the volume exchanged for the day, but that can't be right, as for example for MG.AI1 the chart shows no trade today, but the "Traded" amount is not zero...


[04-Nov-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ElDonad**:	Is it perhaps the volume traded the day before ?


[04-Nov-23 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	That's a very good question, one that would be really helpful for me to know as well.


[04-Nov-23 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Looking at that price chart, looks like something in the range of 760 MG.AI1 traded on Nov 2.  Perhaps that metric is for the last two days or something?  That would be weird though.


[04-Nov-23 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	TBH, I generally ignore the stats on CXP.  They're not generally that helpful IMO, compared to looking at CXOB and CXPC.

[04-Nov-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I do trading and before I enter a market, I analyze CXPC, and it generally provides me what I need to know up front, so that I know the risks.

[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	With what specifically?


[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	i'm just starting out, got the first contract to make exo work suits


[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	but i'm missing materials


[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	and idk how to get them


[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	You can buy materials at the exchange, you'll need to send your ship there to pick them up.


[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	For me there was a contract that explained how to do that.


[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	i guess i didn't get one like that


[08-Nov-23 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	i don't know how to move my ships


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	On the top left change screen to 'travel', then there should be a 'fleet' window with your ships, and under the 'command' header, click fly. Then select Antares Station as the destination.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	First unload your cargo if it is full though.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	oh i forgot this game uses real time


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	this is gonna be nearly 9 real hours


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes. I don't know if there is a way to return automatically. At the station you can open a warehouse and store goods that you've bought.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	you like by it or do you need materials to make one?


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	buy**


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	They are rented, it was quite cheap for me.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	how long is the rental for?


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	weekly


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	gotcha


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I started last week, spent everything on carbon and hydrogen to make PE plastic.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**VoxZer0**:	what specialty did you pick


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**VoxZer0**:	word


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	You'll also need to buy some supplies: rations, drinking water, overalls, unless you intend to make them yourself.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	There is no auto return.  Also, hey lukeskye, how goes the manufacturing?


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Question: if there is a lot more demand than supply, does the price tend to go up?


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Later Vox.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Sometimes.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Depends on the item in question and whether big corporations start producing in house.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Okay. What are you making now?


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Rations, Drinkable Water, and Raw Cotton Fibers.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Two things that can only be cheaply produced on some worlds, and one people like to refine.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Nice. Are you doing any trading between exchanges?


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Not at the current moment.  While it can be worthwhile, they all use different currencies.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Current plan is to expand to 4x the production, then refine the cotton and produce carbon.  Should take 3 or so months.


[08-Nov-23 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Hmm, I'm looking to get into exchange trading once I get enough cash to carry a full load.


[08-Nov-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Ah yes, the life of a travelling merchant I see.  Only real risk is that you would be subject to the fickle whims of the market.


[08-Nov-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes. Can you tell how long it takes to get to Moria? I sold all my FTL fuel


[08-Nov-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	one sec


[08-Nov-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	It will take 292 units of FTL fuel to get there, and take 2 days.


[08-Nov-23 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Thanks.


[08-Nov-23 11:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Absolute minimum amount of FTL fuel is still 195 units at 2days and 8 hours.  You will need to carry excess fuel or buy it at your destination.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, I will buy it.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I have discovered that I can buy aluminum for 3.5 mushrooms here and sell it for 5 at Moria.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Aluminum to mushroom trade? well, it does look profitable at least.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	With a max cargo of 180 AL,  that is around 43K in mushroom profit, -6k in fuel leaves 37K profit in 4 days.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	That's pretty good.  How much of that is in which currency though?


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	It's in AIC.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	does that mean you're buying the fuel here then?


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	The price is the nearly same here and there.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Yeah, but they use NCC


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	On average looks cheaper there.


[08-Nov-23 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Yes, I will sell the aluminum for NCC and buy fuel with it.


[08-Nov-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Alright, just checking because this is one of those areas that can trip people up.


[08-Nov-23 11:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Okay. Is there any way to take out a loan?


[08-Nov-23 11:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	If you have pro or basic (which you get if you get pro and don't renew it) you can set up a contract with another player for a loan.


[08-Nov-23 11:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Nice.


[08-Nov-23 11:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Honestly, at this point, if you get pro you might be better off running a wholesale business, where you use contracts to directly buy from corporations and sell to others or on the exchange at a higher price.


[08-Nov-23 11:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	either way, lots of ways to play.  I just farm and handle my faction contracts.


[08-Nov-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Makes sense.


[08-Nov-23 11:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I just understood what you meant by the fuel.


[08-Nov-23 11:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I checked the price ratio of AL to FF here and there, and it is 20% better there, so even more profit.


[09-Nov-23 12:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Also, remember that if you feel the sell orders are a bit too low, you can make a new order in the order book by placing you sell price above the highest price, at which point you just store it onsite or leave the ship there until the order is filled.


[09-Nov-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Makes sense. I'll tell you how it went next week.

**Pacific982**:	Man, Phobos is getting more active lately.


[10-Nov-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Also, why does it seem like some companies are trying to artificially inflate the prices of goods?  I'm looking at RCO orders right now, and the first thing I see is Interstellar Gaia buying at 750 then selling it back at 1000.


[10-Nov-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	What is inflating the price there?


[10-Nov-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	he's buying low and selling high


[10-Nov-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	trading 101


[10-Nov-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pacific982**:	Its on the exact same commodity exchange, and he set the price high enough that those goods aren't going to be sold for months, effectively trapping goods in the market while starving smaller companies.  As a result people have to start paying more or sacrifice valuable building space to produce it themselves.


[10-Nov-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[10-Nov-23 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Scorpy.**:	who*


[10-Nov-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	@Pacific982 Interstellar Gaia is a competitor of mine. We're both spread traders- we buy low and sell high on the same commodity at the same CX. I hope you're not implying that spread trading is inherently manipulating the market. It IS true that some people do spread trading and try to manipulate the market. Someone did that with RAT.AI1 a couple months back and inflated the prices up to about 140 AIC, but they failed to maintain a permanent price fix. But most of the activity I've seen from Interstellar Gaia is not that, just trading for goods within the well-established price ranges.


[10-Nov-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Spread trading, when done without trying to manipulate, is good for the market. It decreases the bid-ask spread, which means that players wanting an instant sale have a more favorable price. It also increases price stability by adding more buy/sell orders to the CX.


[10-Nov-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I don't know the RCO market though, so I'm not sure whether that activity was manipulative, but at first glance his activity seems within the normal price ranges.

**Churaviis**:	A trade doesn't occur until a buy and ask at the same price are placed. If you want it right away then place a buy order at the price of the lowest cost ask order.

**Laichonious**:	So what's all this about a strike at the CoC? To be honest, I haven't been paying close attention to the upkeep, though I will donate when I think of it/can


[05-Dec-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	Just that the upkeep wasn't fully made before it was due


[05-Dec-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's taken care of


[05-Dec-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	as soon as the contribution is completed the strike will be over


[05-Dec-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Laichonious**:	Nice, I threw some DW and RAT in there to help out :)


[05-Dec-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lanshara**:	usualy it's just due to somebody starting a base and changing the requirements just before the upkeep is due


[05-Dec-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Laichonious**:	oh that's funny, I guess it could make sense to set a buffer time like 48hs from when the requirements were met where they can't change, but I can see why they are doing it this way too, less complex

**Rwinner16**:	just giving you a hard time :P. No way any GOV can be prepped for a 600 SCI jump in demand. I don't know of any planet, other than Prom, that could handle that.


[13-Dec-23 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Circe*


[13-Dec-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Dec-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	oh hell, that may be my next SCI endeavor. I never looked at that planet. I don't honestly know if the CX's can keep up with the SCI demands though. Feeding these 900 will be hard


[13-Dec-23 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	Then Malahat and Jeetiyu could be your next target, both could handle a lot of SCI


[13-Dec-23 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Insula_Crisium**:	Which commodities are the most challenging to feed from the CX for SCI?


[13-Dec-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Supply wise? WIN and MEA were for me earlier. CX didn't have enough of either for me to fill my base to my reserve goal. Didn't want to empty CX, so I only took like half.


[13-Dec-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	That's nice of you. :-)


[13-Dec-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	If you have future issues getting enough MEA, I have a huge supply and have a hard time selling it.


[13-Dec-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I haven't traded in WIN yet, but I have in most of the more common consumables.  Maybe one day I'll be able to supply all consumables to be a one-stop shop.


[13-Dec-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	My demand inquiry today for MEA was just shy of 3000.


[13-Dec-23 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	It's unfortunate that I sold off a lot of my MEA stock yesterday.  I probably had 1000-1500 of that.

[17-Dec-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Archiel**:	So if new players starting on Phobos want to build software, I will buy LD and SAL directly (4000 AIC per SAL and 6000 per LD). The difficulty there is that the buildings 1xHB3 and 2xSD is about 500,000 AIC, which is tough for a new player


[21-Dec-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I do not recommend electronics when starting out


[21-Dec-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ogrebeef-Backkicker**:	...Unless you can get a loan from an established player.


[21-Dec-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Yeah, I agree. You should have a loan and probably a plan/agreement to sell whatever you're making


[21-Dec-23 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	Cleanrooms are also an option.  There are a few profitable options that make it attractive


[21-Dec-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

**HARDTOKILL**:	I am already set up, producing PE and MCG. Is place orders on the local market cheaper than flying to the exchange for input resources and consumables.


[25-Dec-23 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Numsgil**:	there aren't any orders on the Phobos local market currently.  If there were, you'd need to have a PRO account to buy/sell there.  They generally aren't cheaper than the CX, it's more a way to give people spot resources if they're low or to do trades with other players.  Most of the time you'll be buying and selling from the CX

[14-Jan-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	The ask is 99.60, which has 1920 units readily available.  So you either have to pay 99.60 or wait for someone to sell at 90.

[17-Jan-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	If you have Pro, you could accept shipping contracts and make some good side money that way.


[17-Jan-24 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	If you have a small amount of reserve cash, you could also start trading on the CX, which takes a lot of time

**Churaviis**:	If anyone else wants to try running Phobos they're welcome to try but many of the upkeep items are not readily available on the CX in the quantities needed regularly and would have to be produced in house or purchased from me since I already produce them.


[19-Jan-24 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I already subsidize Phobos upkeep so a new governor would either need to subsidize it as well or raise taxes significantly


[19-Jan-24 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I took on Phobos as a challenge and to make sure OOG had the workers necessary for our high tier electronics production lines. I guarantee a penny-pincher will do far worse here.

**marismols**:	Hello. I'm looking for people to join forces to produce more affordable electronic and ship components for Antares. Looks like everybody is busy making a big buck selling market makers. Would need some people who would be willing to dedicate one or few factories to make stuff that is greatly overpriced or missing altogether from CX. Each of us would be responsible for certain components to make sure they are avaialble on the market for everybody for a price that is sensible. Please DM me if you want to take part in such endeavour :)

**MagicalBurrito**:	Yo, does anyone here produce carbon?


[16-Feb-24 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagicalBurrito**:	Or is it even possible? Carbon is cutting into my profit a lot, would be nice if it somewhat profitable/possible

**rzuraf**:	@MagicalBurrito check in PRUNplanner if it's better to buy carbon or to produce carbon


[16-Feb-24 04:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	cause even if you place the INC you will have to buy stuff to make carbon


[16-Feb-24 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	depending on your production setup it might be more profitable


[16-Feb-24 04:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	(or not :D)


[16-Feb-24 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	counting ONLY the price of ingredients for C (and assuming you want to make 4 carbon every 8 hrs) it's just a difference of  45 AIC


[16-Feb-24 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	ofc you can use other recepie but then the time is doubled or tripled


[16-Feb-24 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	and you have to get more consumables for additional production building and so on :)

**rzuraf**:	you COULD produce all ingredients and have RIG, FRM, INC and make C with everything it needs but is it worth it? ;)

**marismols**:	Price of carbon seems resonable at the moment. Can't make it much cheaper. Just try to look for products to make than have better profit margin.

**Vasyklo**:	When I first started I kept looking into making C to help my profits. It never really made a big difference for my empire


[16-Feb-24 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Vasyklo**:	So I ate the price at the cx and moved on lol


[16-Feb-24 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagicalBurrito**:	yee i started to calculate the amount of money needed, it will not pay itself that good. Maybe down the line when i get like 100k then i can start the production of C


[16-Feb-24 07:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagicalBurrito**:	Can double my profits


[16-Feb-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**I_am_Tex**:	The best way to play this game is to NOT be self sufficient.  Specialize and rely on the market for things outside of your specialty.


[16-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Makes the game more social, and also makes you more profitable by leveraging experts

[16-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I've been importing thousands of units of carbon into the ANT CX the past few weeks. Hopefully that has helped bring prices down. Usually they're higher in ANT than some other regions. It's win-win, because I get some trading profits from it, while prices stay lower due to extra supply. Glad to hear it sounds like it's working.

**Owyhee**:	I Have just started my first base on Phobos extracting water and SIO. Producing MCG but not sure what to do with the water maybe start up Carbon farm?


[04-Mar-24 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	Generally you want a start planet with a planetary program bonus with what you are doing. A carbon farm may be wise on a different planet that is fertile perhaps a second base


[04-Mar-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Owyhee**:	That makes sense but I am trying to figure out best use of my water I am producing. Maybe I should just scrap the water plant but not sure if I get my resources back


[04-Mar-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Circle_of_Life**:	You will get the materials back if it's early. Nothing wrong with selling the extra water

**rahzo**:	Hey everyone. I was wondering what everyone produces here? Just trying to get a grasp on the future


[12-May-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The COGC here gives a bonus to electronics, but that's a small industry and only really useful at more advanced stages. As such, newer players will run all sorts of different industries. If it's your first planet, feel free to experiment with whatever you want, just be sure to pick something with a big enough market to be able to sell your product quickly


[12-May-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	I was figuring that was the case with the COGC. Thanks for explaining that. I went with Carbon Farmer just cuz I saw a decent demand


[12-May-24 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Carbon farmer is a good choice


[12-May-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	Now i just gotta figure out the best recipe to use or combo


[12-May-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Farms take up a lot more space than incinerators, so the slower recipe is usually better as it optimizes for area, which will be the limiting factor fairly quickly


[12-May-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	I didnt think of Area but I did see the return on the HCP being the best overall


[12-May-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I think GRN is generally considered the best


[12-May-24 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Make sure you check out the public discord, generally there are folks there giving new players free cash to help start their base


[12-May-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	Interesting, at the slowest rec on prunner, HCP is showing a better return


[12-May-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	w/ 2 FRM and 2 INC


[12-May-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	There are 2 recipes for GRN, you need to use the 4 h20 for 4 grn for fastest recipe


[12-May-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	Yeah 400 more

**rahzo**:	Bad or extra slow? What makes it bad?


[13-May-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	It's slower in that the COGC planetary bonus doesn't apply to an industry that newer players have access to, meaning you don't get that extra efficiency boost. That does make it better in that you can experiment with any industry, or even multiple industries, because you aren't locked into a single one, making it a great place to experiment, fail and then start somewhere else more optimized for your new plan once you've learned from your failures, as often happens at least once with newer players.

**Rwinner16**:	Howdy!


[17-May-24 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	From an experienced player; I think you chose the wrong planet.. Phobos is subpar in almost every aspect. It will significantly slow your development; but will provide much deeper learning of the game.


[17-May-24 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	The game is.. a lot. But I'm at almost 1000 days and going strong if that tells you anything!


[17-May-24 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@nathaniel_Lizzard It is very easy to restart somewhere else. As someone else who started on phobos and regreted it for a month before older players rescued me, if you need any help or want to cooperating on projects making products with other people, feel free to reach out!


[17-May-24 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rzuraf**:	I started on Phobos and after about 100 days moved made 2nd base on Vulcan, where I (as a metalurgist) strive! I still use my phobos base mostly for oxygen extraction for smelting

[17-May-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-May-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-May-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-May-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WebLit**:	Depending on what you produce you might only have to log in once a week, but you probably wont make as much money.


[17-May-24 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AriesNation**:	As a newer player... You can get away with hopping on like once a week. Then you slowly get more and more invested and eventually have 10 bases and need to log in at least daily xDD


[17-May-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-May-24 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-May-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Allocator is the market maker of the south, similar to how Lowstrife is the market maker of the north.


[24-May-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Although I have my doubts as to how long he can hold down prices that low. I'm keeping my carbon at 800 until the market pans out. Long term, I think it will go back to the 600 range eventually though.


[24-May-24 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**rahzo**:	Well burning these Grains for Mid Gains I guess


[24-May-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**WebLit**:	i mean.. i started my first base here a little over a week ago and made way more than i would have as a farmer.


[27-May-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WebLit**:	Starting on promitor is definitely safer though. And you probably wont be able to get a base plot on there any other way.


[27-May-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-24 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	opportunity cost and all that


[27-May-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WebLit**:	I feel like smelters are better than farmers though just because of the amount of flexibility you have. It's so easy just to switch to a product in high demand and make bank


[27-May-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WebLit**:	when you are starting out at least


[27-May-24 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-May-24 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WebLit**:	what makes Phobos good for food


[27-May-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Less about Phobos being good for food and more about Phobos being cheap to build on + really good proximity to CX + lots of players willing to do intra-system shipping

[03-Jun-24 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	It has a bonus to a product family that is simple to execute on


[03-Jun-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	and more importantly, is completely filled up permit-wise, which means if you don't start there you can never settle

**Pling0**:	well


[03-Jun-24 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jun-24 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jun-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jun-24 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rwinner16**:	Ignore most of us old-timers. It's easy for thos of us with millions to just tell you to demo and rebuild into Electronics CoGC costing millions.


[19-Jun-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	At some point, you may or may not want to build into Electronics. It is very lucrative, yes, but depending if you stay F2P, it may not be for you.


[19-Jun-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	For a long long time I used to use Phobos as a catch-all base. I didn't have enough actual electronics need to justify a full base, but the location proved doubly useful to supplement Deimos, Heph, Griff.

[22-Jun-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	You should consider COLIQing(restarting) and being a farmer. It'll likely allow you to expand more efficiently than if you made prefabs yourself


[22-Jun-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	aka COLIQ and go to Promitor


[22-Jun-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Doing construction on Phobos isn't desirable due to it's production buff being in a different industry


[22-Jun-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	and because you can always come back here later when you want, where as you cannot ever settle a planet like Promitor unless you start there


[22-Jun-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HushPup**:	Why's that?


[22-Jun-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Prom is in a tier of planets SO desirable that the available space on the planet is completely filled


[22-Jun-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	and it's filled to a degree that it will never open up again


[22-Jun-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	the only way to circumvent that is by starting the game on the planet


[22-Jun-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jun-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea probably restart - If you want manufacturing choose Katoa, Agriculture / Food choose Promitor, Metallurgy choose Vallis, Chemistry choose Montem


[24-Jun-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-24 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We just got our POPR and are still attracting ENG and SCI at a healthy rate. We've still got some unfilled SCI jobs, but that's to be expected as there are always more people looking to build more IDC farms. We now have a decent ENG surplus. I can't guarantee that will continue, as a single EDC farm could gobble it up, but I'll continue adding as many ENG as I can through both high-tier upkeep and tier 3 education programs.


[26-Jun-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	We are always looking for solid members but unfortunately we can't add free players to our corp. Take some time to figure out the game and determine if you like it enough to throw the devs a bone. If so, hit us up then and we'll see if you're OOG material.


[26-Jun-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GalaxyInc**:	thanks for the offer, but I'm only playing free license


[26-Jun-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-24 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GalaxyInc**:	can you add basic members?


[26-Jun-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	Consider COLIQing and come to Promitor


[26-Jun-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	new player support systems are much more fleshed out there


[26-Jun-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	and the production buff is new player friendly


[26-Jun-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LapsedNortonSubscription**:	plus, due to how the plot system works, you will never be able to have a base on Promitor unless you start there. You can always come back to Phobos


[26-Jun-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Technically we can add basic members but in reality we can't have very many since basic members can't initiate contracts, meaning they can't interact with other basic members. We also want members who are going to stick around for a while and those unwilling to sacrifice a bit generally fall off much quicker.


[26-Jun-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

We’ve had a similar idea, called government notice board, but it was removed, to reduce the scope of the release. Maybe in a future release!

**_Davv_**:	How do new players get contracts from other people? Curious..


[01-Jul-24 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	talk to them. Use your words to get them to do stuff.


[01-Jul-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**_Davv_**:	So just like in reality, thank you.


[01-Jul-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	😄 For example, if you mention that you have plans to make a large enough quantity of something to sell, I would send you a contract for a wholesale purchase. But it may take a while to scale to that level if you have a new company.


[01-Jul-24 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**_Davv_**:	What's your definition of large enough? Over 100.000 worth of asset, or maybe more?


[01-Jul-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**_Davv_**:	Also another important question. Is there any ability in-game to save some custom data, ie. notepad or clipboard, or I need to use other software for it and synchronise it between devices on my own?


[01-Jul-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	depends on the commodity, but I'm looking for about 500k-1M of value of goods.  Generally I'm looking for more on high-volume commodities and towards the lower 500k end for thinly traded ones.


[01-Jul-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	Interesting question.  There's a commonly used PrUn extension, PMMG, that has notepad functionality.  IDK if it can synchronize, but maybe you can hack it to work.


[01-Jul-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**_Davv_**:	I will note that and will contact you first as soon as I get into this level of liquidity. Any goods, or particular category?

I'll be continuing the education program and all the upkeep to build up as much ENG and SCI unemployment as I can. I'm sure the extra scientists on an electronics planet so close to a CX will attract a new EDC or IDC farm sooner or later.

[04-Jul-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The election for Phobos has started. There is one governor and 4 member of parliament offices open for election. We currently have 10 players running for them. I am glad for the competition to keep me on my toes and it makes me want to be an even better governor even though I've accomplished so much already. I would be remiss in my duty, however, if I didn't warn everyone running of the complexities of Phobos governance. If it is not the most complex planet to govern in the galaxy then it is among the most complex. Not only is it high tier, but it has a large high-tier population and requires many niche upkeep materials that cannot be easily found on an CX in the quantities needed at a reasonable price. For this reason, I have had to dedicate significant portions of my operation to produce these upkeep materials myself, perhaps multiple permits.


[04-Jul-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	For this reason I recommend that anyone that is new to the game, to governance, or who is not willing to dedicate multiple permits to providing upkeep for Phobos, should withdraw from the election and find a simpler planet on which gain experience. Voters should also take these considerations into account when making their decision of who to vote for.


[04-Jul-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	In addition, I believe that whoever is elected governor should be the one to provide the upkeep materials. Not only will they be the one recieving all the glory and credit for the success of Phobos but they are the ones the voters chose. I'm certain that voters will recognize all that I have done for Phobos and re-elect me to continue the success we've had. If not, however, I will be repurposing my permits and passsing the responsibility for the upkeep of Phobos to whoever the voters choose after an appropriate transition period.


[04-Jul-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	As such, I believe that all nominees should state whether they believe they are able and willing to provide the upkeep should they become Governor. I recommend against running for governor here if you already have other mid or high tier planets to manage. I myself will not be governor of any other high or mid tier planets so that I can focus on Phobos. I recommend that voters steer clear of anyone who does not confidently state that they are able and willing to focus on providing what Phobos needs.


[04-Jul-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	This is more important given that the part of the game that needs to be balanced the most is upkeep and infrastructure. When that happens, which will hopefully be soon, the governing of Phobos will be impacted more than most and having a governor that can focus on Phobos and figure out the changes smoothly will be even more important.


[04-Jul-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Thank you for your support Phobos


[04-Jul-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Long live Churaviis. We run in support of his continued governance


[04-Jul-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Insula_Crisium**:	I don't planning on running for any parliament seats, but I did want to point out that upkeep is not inherently tied to governance.  Businesses like mine can provide those goods regularly to our clients, and it does not have to all be on the MPs' shoulders

**Scorpy.**:	As you can see I am running for parliament. My message and objective is simple. My goal isnt to be governor, but to make the voice of beginners known. This is a planet dominated by experienced players producing electronics. If you vote for me, I promise to give a voice to those not as fortunate as us.


[04-Jul-24 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hello Phobos! For the new players who don't know me, to the older players who see my name on a lot of planets, I am Rise. I have governed directly on Hephaestus for the past 25 election cycles, and have managed 15+ other planets via proxy governors for various periods of time since I started 2 years ago. I saw that in Antares, no corporation or group of people had stepped up in a meaningful way to competently manage any planet outside of the main ones that made the most money for them, like Phobos. And the few planets outside these large few being by someone often were done so very poorly. I’ve been an advocate for good governors and competent governance since I started holding office, and an opponent to any who take the office for granted and do not consistently manage the population well.


[04-Jul-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	This is a big planet. It takes effort to run. Apparently too much at times, given the missed unfulfilled COGCs that occasionally pop up and whenever POPI input is forgotten and high end population starts to nose dive until I, among others, have to DM him and remind him to actually maintain the planet. Both the governor, and his entire corp that he leans on, somehow, have repeatedly forgotten about one of their largest planets. And this is not the only one, as their HQ on Nike often suffers as well. See the below photos and look up the POPRs yourself if you disagree and notice how steeply the high end populations essential to folk’s production is tanking, WHILE THERE ARE OPEN JOBS. Tell me I’m wrong and that this quality management is acceptable.


[04-Jul-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I govern planets because it’s what I enjoy doing. My industry and 30 bases are configured for it. I do it well on Hephaestus, Eos, and Astraeus, just in this system alone, and I’ve done it well at ~14 or so other worlds in Antares space. I would like your vote because I think a better job can be done here at Phobos than what is currently happening. And more than that, I think other folks like LazySiege, Scorpy., and LapsedNorton would make great Parliamentarians, not beholden to the same corporation as the current governor that have allowed all too many mistakes to flourish here. Regardless of who wins what seats, I will offer my advice freely. But to make change, change must happen, and to do that, I and the others I’ve listed need votes. Please vote at “ADM ZV-307D”!

**RiseofFilth**:	I say all the above with no malice towards anyone. Merely a hope towards a better planet and election.


[04-Jul-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Saying this will likely incite OOG and their members to attack me and accuse me of various things. I, for example, have by no means been perfect and fulfilled every COGC on time across my 17 planets for 2 years straight. Likely they will rally every member in their corp and pressure them to vote for their candidates and how they are righteous and I villainous. They are welcome to. At the end of the day, I want there to be accountability in governing, and I want capable people in the office and Parliament. I think mindlessly voting only based on the ticker of your corporation is a scourge on our elections and will only enable lazy governing and encourage mistakes.


[04-Jul-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Even if nothing changes on this planet and I get ousted on every planet I’ve managed for months and years, it will be done on the principle of holding people accountable for mistakes. When I lose elections, I hope it is because I have erred, and not because the other person running has a OOG by their name.


[04-Jul-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Once again, Please vote at “ADM ZV-307D”!


[04-Jul-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I don't claim to be perfect, but I have managed this, one of the most complex planets, for almost two years, sacrificing multiple permits to do so and slowing down my progress in other goals I could have persued in game. In that amount of time occasional mistakes are inevitable for anyone. In that time, no one else has seemed to want to manage Phobos. Had I not stepped up, who knows whether anyone else woud have or what kind of job they would have done. If two years of sacrifice counts for nothing to the voters then so be it.

**Domicius**:	Nobody has to incite me to vote for Churaviis. Or anyone in OOG. I just think that this kind of politics is out of place. I regularly contribute to the upkeep here, and I don't do it thinking "oh no, the governor has failed", no more than I do so on KI-840C, or Harmonia, or Eos, or anywhere where we all throw some stuff into the mix.


[05-Jul-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I understand that for some people, running 15 planets is how they find fun in the game.  And more power to you. However that ultimately represents a concentration of power in literally one pair of hands.


[05-Jul-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	I think that an open and collaborative approach to government - which is what the devs intended, is the opportunity we have before us.


[05-Jul-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Domicius**:	Of course, the politics of our time is very much around "othering" and 2-party systems, so I get why so much of our rhetoric is aggressive.

**RiseofFilth**:	@domicus Considering the way OOG "collects" our taxes from various planets, including Phobos, is to allow 30+ accounts, with a significant number of them inactive, to collect an equal share via weekly payout(at least, up until this politics change), I would hope they all contribute, not just you. Somehow though, I've never seen more than 2-3 people do so. Every OOG member takes our taxes and does not contribute back to the planets they are taken from. And then OOG Governors, like Churav here, has the audacity to complain about upkeep costs being significant. What you do is not charity, and it never has been. Its grift.


[05-Jul-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Yall literally have a channel in your discord where you bragged weekly about the free cash that would get distributed to everyone from our taxes. Tell me I'm wrong, and that every person, even the inactives, paid it all back *somehow*.


[05-Jul-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I find the governing enjoyable, after I found this region woefully underserved and numerous planets left governorless. But all things end, and I am not so blind as to think that having other people, who are competent, motivated, and trustworthy in gov positions is a bad thing. I'm only here because there was a vaccum of competency. That is what I am asking accountability for. COGCs on strike once a month and forgotten POPI inputs for months/weeks at a time causing population declines are not acceptable when there are people who actually want to do a good job.


[05-Jul-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	See local channels like Norwick or Deimos. While I disagree with OOG's previous collection methods, a new patch and politics system is the law of the land, and I support good governors like Turlorn and Paris_In_Springtime. Id happily support them here, but I dont see them running. Give me a good candidate who is attentive and capable, and I'll support them rather than running. Churavriis is not it, and has not been it for some time.


[05-Jul-24 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	churv if you resent running phobos so much, why you still running now? There's 11 people running, more interest than there's ever been, so I don't think you can any longer claim that the reason you keep running is that nobody else wants to step up. Additionally, even if one is legitimately concerned about rise running for govt on so many planets, this one has 5 seats and there are no other members of his alleged posse running here so I think you're safe to finally rest, my friend


[05-Jul-24 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I think if you asked any person running right now, every one would tell you they don't want to supply all the POPI for this planet


[05-Jul-24 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	except him


[05-Jul-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Id actually love to work with Parliament folks to supply different aspects of the POPI and pay them via the motion system. I'm fuckin geeking out and excited as hell to use that method to help grow the base of POPI input producers and people familiar with planet management.


[05-Jul-24 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	On smaller planets, its silly and clickfest. Here? I think it will be super cool


[05-Jul-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	the randos who clicked it for fun because "why not", sure I can see that, but are you really trying to claim that none of the OOG members, nearly half the candidates, are interested in actually looking after the planet if elected? That seems bold


[05-Jul-24 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	Ah well there's a difference between desire for influence and desire for control. Unfortunately the new system doesn't make that clear, so it's required to be stated by intentions

[05-Jul-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	No one said not looking after it, not at all, just that one person in the corporation has already created and runs the supply lines for supplying the POPI


[05-Jul-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Churaviis**:	OOG kept taxes lower than they would have been. Everytime a new governor took over from an Ooger, taxes went up. How do you call that 'grift' when were literally subsidizing citizens? What do voters care about how it works behind the scenes as long as it works?


[05-Jul-24 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Who is going to be making the POW and MHP and HOG and SOI and FOD and TUB and CD and DIS and HD and all their inputs and everything else that Phobos needs to maintain the growth in high tier workers that we've had?


[05-Jul-24 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Because people, including you, complain about the cost of maintaining the planet, but then intentionally give that money away to everyone, including inactive accounts. Raising the taxes would do nothing because it would just spread it out among all those irrelevant accounts that contribute nothing.


[05-Jul-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I'm not complaining, I'm making sure everyone running knows what they're getting into, otherwise Phobos is going to have a rough time while they figure it out


[05-Jul-24 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	First off, I make or have sources for every one of those products. I do not fear providing items from my production. But I hope as time goes on, there will be those, including parliamentarians, who step up and offer to sell to the planet such materials. But in the short term? I can absolutely do it, easily.

**Insula_Crisium**:	fair enough!


[05-Jul-24 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Your plan is to hope someone else sacrifices permits while your stockpiles dwindle lower and lower? Plans based on nothing but hope rarely pan out well.


[05-Jul-24 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Taxes are incredibly minor slice of the pie that is profitability in production. It is completely miniscule. There is nothing wrong with charging a planet a fair tax, and to hold low taxes in exchange for vote just reeks of ego-centrism as your motivation, rather than maintaning the planet.


[05-Jul-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Who sacrificing permits? No one is damanding they give up their production for free


[05-Jul-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It will be a profitable purchase, like anything else would be. Maybe less so than outrageous market prices, but no one is selling at a loss.


[05-Jul-24 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I'm focusing on Phobos, meaning I can sacrifice a permit or two to produce what the market does not. You don't seem to be willing to sacrifice anything for Phobos if you're not willing to build out production for it. Even if you were willing, having multiple high tier planets to manage means you can't sacrifice a few permits for each to produce what they need.


[05-Jul-24 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	I have a solid, proven plan that focuses on Phobos and no where else.


[05-Jul-24 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I believe we can manage via my own normal production, which otherwise goes to market, or goes to other things. As much as I can sell to MMs, I can sell to the planet, at a fair mark up, paid for by the same tax rates as every other world in Antares. Having insular and unprofitable businesses only successful by centrally controled businesses is why the USSR collapsed


[05-Jul-24 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And as I believe is the point of this new system, to bring new people into governing, is to encourage us to spread to load among more than a single person, and I am eager to do that with whoever becomes Parliamentarian, or anyone else who wants to make money doing something other than selling MMs to the CX.

[05-Jul-24 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I dont see it that way. Maybe thats why I am good at what I do.

**Churaviis**:	Refusing to acknowledge the difficulty of a thing only makes it harder to give it the work it deserves.


[05-Jul-24 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It is difficult and takes work, but that is mitigated by having a good mindset, a good system, and a good team. Those things make it easier.


[05-Jul-24 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I hope all Parliamentarians, here and other planets, strive to be that team and check and support the whole.


[05-Jul-24 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	My goal here is not to be a 1 man army that does and controls it all. I hope to create a system and attitude that will survive me when I step down or get voted out.

**MoldySasuage**:	yo how do i pick up cargo from the commodity market


[06-Jul-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hey Moldy, if you bought it from the CX, you need to make sure you have a warehouse there


[06-Jul-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You can do that by opening a new buffer or "window", and typing in "STNS ANT"


[06-Jul-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	There, you can click "Antares Station Warehouse" and rent some space


[06-Jul-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Each rent/click gets you 1 unit of 500 space


[06-Jul-24 10:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I recommend clicking a few times :)


[06-Jul-24 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	After that, you can check your contracts, the bar on the left side lists "CONT"


[06-Jul-24 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you ever buy something on the CX and you dont have enough space in your CX inventory, it will create a contract to hold onto the items


[06-Jul-24 10:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You just have to open the contract and deliver the item

**Deckss**:	Quite a sum you pulled out there


[13-Jul-24 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	and I'm going to pull out another 4mil or so once Ive finished upgrading the planets infrastructure. You only need to scroll up a very small amount to see what that money is going to, to see the state of the POPI materials (i took screenshots) prior to this elected government taking office.


[13-Jul-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorpy.**:	seemed reasonable to me


[13-Jul-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I stated the costs, I stated my reasoning, and I feel investing in upgrading planetary infrastructure is the best path to driving down the high monthly costs that the planet was being run at previously.


[13-Jul-24 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	These upgrades will enable our government to save 700k monthly by allowing us to use cheaper inputs to maintain the same fulfillment and population levels.


[13-Jul-24 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But these upgrades arent free, and I'm not going to wring my hands and do nothing or undersupply things and allow people who have a base here to have scientist issues that persist multiple months, like has been going on. I will act decisively to improve things, along with the consent and support of the members of Parliament, who have all supported my actions.

Avoiding staying into heresay, I'll simply say, cheaper a simpler to produce inputs for our POPI will ensure that there is never a disruption in inputs, which could cause a shortage and lack of fulfillment, and a gap in population growth in a time when there are open jobs.

**RiseofFilth**:	https://imgur.com/a/IQ11Lwn For those interested in accountability and tracking spending, at this link, you can see the input material requirements for 3x ART, 2x PAR, and 2x INF upgrades. With some additional POPI inputs to max things out and have the planet supplied for the next month or so, this comes to an approximate 7mil of upgrades and upkeep material (at least at my internal prices, I'm sure if you did the math yourself and used CX prices, you will see it is well below it).

**Zibeb**:	One thing that might be helpful, any buffer or tile you look at should have the Buffer command next to the title. So for instance, if I look at this buffer, I see COMG pl-zv-307d, which is private group (COMG) and the planet identifier for Phobos.


[24-Jul-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zibeb**:	If you click CMDS on the left-hand sidebar, it gives you the list of commands. I usually need to look up the identifier though, so most buffers I just access through other buffers or make it a tile

**RiseofFilth**:	Actually, and I dont want to put the cart in front of the horse, we had some conversations this past week about doing just that, as I believe the savings from the upgrades has made our income very healthy. Per the parliament dicsussions, I think we want to save some money for future upgrades, maybe some money for jump gates? But once we have a nice warchest, that is definitely something we want to look at.

Phobos Fiscal Questionaire
Hello Phobos! 

I hope this survey finds you well. To the point! 

Phobos currently generates 12mil a month in income, and uses about 2mil a month in POPI upkeep. (When I originally did the math, I thought it was per week, because there is no way it would be that cheap... nope. 2mil a month). This is because this planet has a massive ENG/SCI pop...

**Roh**:	I don't know the specs around here for FEST III weekly costs, but they're expensive none-the-less. The actual benefits that it would provide, initially, would be just an 11% increase in ENG education, and a 5% increase in SCI education. Since the POPI upkeeps on Phobos are balanced to maintain higher tier pops at just over 50% happiness, there only so much room for immediate expansion, should those worker types buffer up to a certain range of unemployment....


[18-Sep-24 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	In other words, everyone with current ENG/SCI opening will get filled in 3 weeks or so, with, or without FEST III running for the whole duration.


[18-Sep-24 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It shouldn't be too much of an issue either, since the weekly workforce redistributions basically have every running at near full capacity.  A 3.5% underemployment for those running ENGs, and a 4.6% underemployment for those running SCIs. :/

**lowstrife**:	montem is another enormous t1 planet with a ton of pioneers, and they run festivities 3 every single week. basically all planets do. It's my understanding that it's by far the best ROI thing to do since it's a free 20% to all population groups...


[18-Sep-24 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	it's not about increasing education rate, it's about decreasing upkeep costs of popi buildings


[18-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	with current popi inputs, if a 20% program were run (est cost of $97,000), projected average happy is 87% for pioneers, 53% for settlers, 65% for techs, 75% for eningeers, 72% for scientists


[18-Sep-24 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	the $ per unit happiness is way cheaper with the program


[18-Sep-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	yeah you can cut the taxes in half if you run this program


[18-Sep-24 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Like on many planets, the main detraction of FES's as a upkeep method is that it locks you into using them and being unable to take advantage of any other program. This makes a government overall less flexible when it comes to addressing population shortages or rapid growth.


[20-Sep-24 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Additionally... There are 3 types of happiness. "True" Happiness, which is the weekly hidden value of happiness as a result of fulfillment and unemployment. There is the weighted happiness that you see on POPR each week, that is calculated on a weighted scale from the previous 4 weeks "


[20-Sep-24 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	"true happiness". The most recent week is most relevant and heavily weighted, 4 weeks back is least weighted. And then FES Happiness. This happiness is always an flat addition to the weighted happiness that you see each week on popr.


[20-Sep-24 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The problem with FESs as an upkeep method is that the planet's weighted happiness is only upkept by fulfillment and unemployment. When you reduce fulfillment levels because you are using FES, the weighted happiness gets stuck at a much lower place, say 20% of where it should be to maintain a population. If we ever wanted to run any other program that is not FES, the weighted happiness would be without that 20% and would take almost a month to undo the suppressed/lowered state that it is in. And all the while, that low happiness for week after week would cause a massive population crash across all pop types.


[20-Sep-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Further, when you use FES as an upkeep method, your ability to influence high-end pop happiness is greatly reduced, because of the way fulfillment capping works. It is much more difficult to influence and target specific pop types, like SCI and ENG, for growth, without massively bloating PIO/SET numbers


[20-Sep-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And the more those numbers become bloated, the more the fulfillment we try to put in becomes diluted across tons of unemployed workers, which means we have to put in even more fulfillment.


[20-Sep-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Ultimately, I think you are likely correct in that in pure monitary terms, we could likely sustain the population as we are now. But the flexibility and available tools to encourage growth when needed would be stripped away from us. And at the end of the day, this planet generates a lot of money, and my personal opinion is such that I would rather spend a little more in exchange for having greather population management flexibility.


[20-Sep-24 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That being said, happy to listen to opinions if people are passionate one way or the other.

**lowstrife**:	I don't see any planetary emergency that could happen, for a planet this size, which would need any other program other than festivals. Education, maybe, but most of the time it's pretty comparable to festival growth on mature worlds.


[20-Sep-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	other than a govenor going afk, which could happen IRL happens to the best of us


[20-Sep-24 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	these are valid points about overall population levels raising overall infrastructure costs


[20-Sep-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Sep-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Sep-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	this being said - I don't have the quadratic or whatever math to be able to fully run these numbers out


[20-Sep-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	but maybe maintaining the safety needs of excess pioneers is cheaper than the safety and culture and comfort of scientists


[20-Sep-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lowstrife**:	so maybe running pioneer rich might end up being cheaper in the long run


[20-Sep-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Sep-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Sep-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Sep-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Each type of management tool, be they POPI (SSTs, INFs....), or Programs (Festivities,...), applies a given magnitude to that base fluctuation.


[21-Sep-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That fluctuation is calculated in-game, statisitcally, so you have a span of 5 weeks, wherein true happiness gets averaged out based on fulfilment levels.


[21-Sep-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	However the overall behavior of POPRs, largely fits that wave motion, if certain requisites are met. I've mentioned before that there's an "education centipede" in other places. Most of the POPR loss is usually seen from PIO--> SET+ education, and subsequent migration, since most planets are in states of equilibrium, wherein an employed base of workers, per tier, is kept, while the rest simply go away.


[21-Sep-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Those requisites are modulated with long-term POPI levels (of the planet's choosing). Add more POPI upkeep, and you will have a higher bar of fluctuation; have less, and you will have problems. What you end up with is a cycle, wherein pop tiers migrate in, and then migrate out. Education happens automatically, so you have a second set of POPR fluctuations... PIOs or whatever get uptiered, fill the unemployment reserves per POPI models, and then start to migrate out, in magnitude, until the true happiness levels go under said buffer levels, when they start to mass again.

**Roh**:	PM == members of parliament.


[21-Sep-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@lowstrife There should be a vote going through any hour now for exactly that education program, as the current shortage from new buildings is basically has a month worth of natural growth slated. That doesnt account for additional new construction. So with the consent of other MPs, we are going to run educations to catch us up.

[26-Sep-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hey Phobos, just wanted to check in with you all as we have another election cycle on our hands. I hope everyone, from the new players (Welcome to the game, dont forget to check out the main PRUN community discord https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP as well as the ADI discord that offers grants and advice to new players https://discord.gg/N6bXSuvbuw ) to the older players like myself, is doing well this fall.  I just wanted to offer 2 thoughts to voters this cycle. First off, my complete satisfaction and approval of the current goverment. Arch, Aries, Scorpy, and Rogue have all been good PMs and I am satisfied with the direction, the grants, the upkeep, and the population growth for Phobos. I’d be happy to see them all be returned to Parliament for future cycles.


[26-Sep-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	My second thought is, while I support folks campaigning for a seat in Parliament if they are passionate and want to contribute and help ensure Phobos is run smoothly, I would like to warn voters against voting for candidates that do not advertise their position, who do not talk, and who are not seriously willing or able to contribute, as Phobos is probably the most consequential planet in all of Antares and deserves attentive and cooperative MPs.


[26-Sep-24 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Specifically, Xepiov. For those of you on multiple planets across Antares, you see this name pop up quite a bit on various planet elections. To offer my perspective, I have never seen this person talk in chat. I’ve never seen his name on the community discord. I’ve never heard his voice. I’ve never met anyone else who has actually managed to get a response or had a conversation with this person. What I have seen is his heavy handed and wasteful contributions to small planets he is able to get elected on, like SE-866e. He clearly does not understand the mechanics of governing and has never once, in years of seeing his name around on the various planets I’ve managed, ever communicated with anyone. I think his ignorance of mechanics and refusal to communicate and work as a team is dangerous to the stability and management of a planet like Phobos, and would highly encourage everyone to vote for another candidate in this, and any other, election.


[26-Sep-24 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It only takes 24 hours of MPs being busy with real life to miss a single vote and 20mil~ of cash in Phobos wallet being stolen by a bad actor.


[26-Sep-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The existing government, of myself, Archiel, Rogue, Aries, and Scorpy are all a fine choice, but if you wanted to pick another, you are welcome to do so. I would ask that as a voter, you should choose a person that is capable and willing to at least communicate with their fellow MPs and further work as a team. And that’s the bare minimum.


[26-Sep-24 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I also endorse maintaining the current governor and parliament situation on Phobos. I think Phobos is a shining star of cooperation in Antares

Rise and Archeil have really have good intention both toward new players, this planet and Anthares region. They willing to consult and comment our though on 'how to manage the planet'. I would not mind other would take the seat instead of me. If you don't have anyone taking seat in your heart on this planet, I reccommend you to vote for them. Prosper to Antares.

[11-Oct-24 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I give most people 2 weeks, since that's my usual deadline for anything. I don't know anything regarding the comings and goings of Insula.... He's not online either, and I haven't been seeing their usual market activity either. Don't know.


[11-Oct-24 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	He's a big player so assumed he wouldnt be likely to just disappear. And I doubt I would be able to source 12k FIM in such a short notice from other players

[11-Oct-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Well unless I can get enough FIM for my bases, I'll have to stop playing too. Dont suppose you know anyone or a few people who produce plenty, do you?


[11-Oct-24 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	No how much do you need?


[11-Oct-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**mast3rd3mon**:	Well I consume about 12k per month


[11-Oct-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun1**:	he didnt produce anythinf, only bought and resold. So the capacity is out there


[11-Oct-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**EvoV**:	I started dumping some of my FIM supply to the market. But I'm not a major producer of it. What bases do you have that you need 12k fim per month? That sounds like a lot of EDC farms?


[13-Oct-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	Avalon producing FIM.IC1 on one permit is good enough for 4 EDC.IC1 bases, but requires 3 permits on Promitor to feed it HER.IC1

**eminence32**:	a note for other new players, not necessarily you:   after you construct a building, you have a short period of time (a few hours) in which you can deconstruct the building and get back 100% of your input materials.  this can be useful to correct any building or planning mistakes

[25-Oct-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	This is a great planet for electronics, but that type of industry is not a good starter industry (also, you cant start in electronics)


[25-Oct-24 01:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Deimos also cannot be gotten on any other way due to plot limits other than starting there


[25-Oct-24 01:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Deimos or Promitor are both great starting locations for Metallurgy and Farming respectively


[25-Oct-24 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arbids**:	Ah ok, what would you say makes Deimos or Promitor better options for metallurgists?


[25-Oct-24 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MerchSkele**:	howdy, also if you want easy cash i reccomend being self suffiecent in carbon production so your smelters can constantly run so you always have a source of metals on hand,


[25-Oct-24 02:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MerchSkele**:	such as gold!


[25-Oct-24 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arbids**:	Yeah carbon is definitely on the to-do list


[25-Oct-24 02:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MerchSkele**:	and it all depends on what you are wanting to focus on produciing. or you can try to do eerythign on your own but that'll take more time to be self suffiecent and you would need more than 1 planet to do that.


[25-Oct-24 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arbids**:	At the moment I'm working on silicon and iron metal production while expanding to later extract the other two resources here as well (especially oxygen). Once I'm extracting all four I'll probably look at their derivatives to see what production method works best with what I'm already making? Sort of like a bottom up approach.


[25-Oct-24 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Arbids**:	If I ever go beyond metals it'd definitely be chemicals though.

**kkami**:	or do we already have a carbon cultist


[26-Oct-24 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	More carbon is always welcome and is an easy sale


[26-Oct-24 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	Basically everything uses carbon and it’s cheap to make, so it’s a good place to expand into :)


[26-Oct-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sidepipe**:	Prices here are usually quite stable, but we had someone buy up a lot of carbon and re-list it higher recently, which is great for anyone looking to sell


[26-Oct-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes please, the universe needs more carbon producers


[26-Oct-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@Arbids, Deimos is a metallurgy planet if you look at the COGC bonus. Promitor is a farming world. I highly recommend you do not settle worlds or construct industry that does not align with the local COGC bonus of that planet. (the only exception is resource extraction, as you gotta get stuff somewhere)


[26-Oct-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hey Phobos! It is the end of the month, and that means elections on all the hotest elections in Antares, not to mention the real world. But lets talk about Phobos. I'm going to repeat what I said a month ago now, as it remains true now. The current Government of myself, Rogue_HX, AriesNation, and Scorpy. have led things pretty smoothy. If I may be so bold, I think we've done a damn good job and kept things running smoothly while the pop has been growing. Not only that, I think we've been attentive to requests for regional growth by distributing money to improve infrasture for all Antareans. I hope you will continue to support and distribute your votes as needed to the lowest recipients like Rogue_HX, Scorpy, and Aries to ensure that trusted and reliable members of our community retain the power to vote on Phobos. Thank you!

[26-Oct-24 04:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arbids**:	Thanks for the advice @[HEPH] RiseofFilth. Deimos doesn't have any available plots but I'm definitely on the lookout for other planets like Deimos that are metallurgy specialised.

**rahzo**:	I stopped selling Carbon on the exchange, to messy. Flat rate of 745 pickup on ANT if you want some message me. I can also trade for consumables or ship repair parts, not often but message me if interested

**rahzo**:	nvm out of C for now. check back later


[04-Nov-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Remember, if you're on Phobos (and have Pro) you are eligible for an ADI grant. So adding a few cleanrooms is within your price range as a new player. (although still maybe not too strongly recommended)

[15-Nov-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**eminence32**:	i might be in the minority, but i think you can start doing any type of production on any type of planet


[06-Dec-24 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	profit margins are rarely so thin that you need the 25% COGC bonus to be profitable.  of course you can be *more* profitable by matching your production to the planet, but it's not an absolute requirement


[06-Dec-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	I'd go further and say that at the PIO and SET tiers that their upkeep is so low that you can build that tier. Of course, when you are playing with ENG and SCI they cost a lot to just exist in your employ so you need the extra efficiency

[27-Dec-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	Hi Seraphim


[27-Dec-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Hello, Seraphim. As you are new player, you may not know that Phobos is not a great place for start. So after looking around and getting info you may want to use opportunity to relocate to neighboring planet


[27-Dec-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	I think there is a help period that allows to demolish buildings and pack materials for free in first two hours


[27-Dec-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**vidilet**:	Other than that, there is no shame in one use of COLIQ command to restart and selecting a more fitting first planet (you don't have to build on a starter planet, it is allowed to travel first)


[27-Dec-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i don't want to disagree with vidilet (i didn't start my company in this part of the universe, so i'm not very familiar with it), but i do want to say it's 100% possible to start a successful company on any of starter planets (including Phobos)


[27-Dec-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSeraphim**:	I'll keep that in mind if things don't pan out here.


[27-Dec-24 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSeraphim**:	Thank you.


[27-Dec-24 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yeah, it's incredibly hard to fail in this game, since there are like so many possibilities... You may do better/worse than others, depending on your choices, but still it's incredibly hard, if you put in some time into it all. :D


[27-Dec-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheSeraphim**:	Reminds me of Eve lol


[27-Dec-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohh no, in Eve you can fail hard.


[27-Dec-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Try out mining in a HS system, in a retriever, and you will get blown to bits within 30 minutes...


[27-Dec-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Try the same thing by joining a corp in NS, and run down to one of their systems... You won't get blown up for months, unless you decide to mine on the weekends.


[27-Dec-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it is possible to fail so badly in PrUn that you're forced to restart, but that's *really hard*.


[27-Dec-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yeah... add an extra digit to a CXPO market order form...


[27-Dec-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that's the only way I can think of you failing hard in Prun.


[27-Dec-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	or maybe get your ship stranded somewhere without fuel.   but even then, the devs will often look kindly on you, and fill you up


[27-Dec-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	even then (akin with the ship stranding)... if you have pro, just reach out to someone in general, or planetary chats.


[27-Dec-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	just reach out to the seller if you made a mistake, and they'll easily be able to refund your purchase... It'll take a day or a week, but it'll usually be done? idk.


[27-Dec-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah, it's almost impossible to fail if you have pro, but not everyone has pro


[27-Dec-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's a "hidden" incentive, for you to buy at least 1 month of pro, so that you get turned from a TRIAL, into a BASIC.


[27-Dec-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	as a basic, you can reach out to other PROs ;)


[27-Dec-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep, basic is a fantasic deal, i think


[27-Dec-24 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	PRO <--> BASICs have an innate synergy... Cheap permits on the latter... Cheap logistics on the former. It's best for either to work out what each needs via negotiation though...


[27-Dec-24 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Hopping into guaranteed "rental" arrangements isn't the best imo, since I can usually find better deals.


[27-Dec-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's an "arms race". Lots of low-ball offers trying to capture whatever's left of a saturated market on #UFO anyways. :/

**Raifur**:	And in other news; Blue Fox company has been established with a base on Phobos. Unverified sources have speculated that the managing director had previously owned a startup company on Promitor (VH-331a) in the Hortus system. Analysts are at a loss for words as Blue Fox company opens their first fuel refinery today.


[02-Jan-25 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katinga**:	If you want to refine fuel, come to the Romulus system.  All of the ingredients for SF are there, and Remus is a Fuel Refining COGC :)

**eminence32**:	welcome :)


[21-Jan-25 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	dont know if it was a smart idea, but I started as a Metalergust


[21-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I think for the starting tutorial Im at "wait for production to complete" stage


[21-Jan-25 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	sounds about right


[21-Jan-25 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I assume the 13 hour timer for my smelter cooking Iron Ore is Real Time


[21-Jan-25 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep!


[21-Jan-25 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	alright.... the next main question I have will be how do I supply my Base. or more, how do I move my ships to get what I need to fill my base with stuff


[21-Jan-25 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	FLT button on left side, select destination and choose fuel spend. You should go slow at the start as you probably shouldnt spend more than you have to on fuel


[21-Jan-25 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	drag and drop cargo between base and ship with both boxes open


[21-Jan-25 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	the local CX is Antares station, find what you want to buy or sell and select trade


[21-Jan-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	asking cause my next task after the current one will be to pick up materials I think for more building but unsure beyond that


[21-Jan-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	yep, just follow the tutorial as it will pay you well to complete the tasks


[21-Jan-25 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	pretty much give you all the materials to build more buildings when complete


[21-Jan-25 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	well, I do have 13 or so hours to wait... but ofc I wanna learn what I can for now


[21-Jan-25 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	it looks like it wants me to pick up stuff for my ships where they currently are


[21-Jan-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	...looking at the contract, it says "pick up 3 different lots of stuff" where my base is. is that the tutorial giving me materials then


[21-Jan-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I also very much approve of my Pioneer workforce wanting "Caffinated INfusion"


[21-Jan-25 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	when you look at a contract, there is a column for "party".  if that column is empty, that means that you have to do the thing listed in the "condition" column.


[21-Jan-25 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if the "party" column has someone else's name there, that means the other party has to do the thing on that line


[21-Jan-25 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	it says Antares Chief Admin Officer for the party tab on all of it


[21-Jan-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	btw, did you accept the contract?


[21-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	Ive not had to do that before.. it says "closed". I assume its a tutorial thing to auto accept them but unsure


[21-Jan-25 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ok, that's accepted.  a "closed" contract means that both parties have accepted it


[21-Jan-25 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	ah


[21-Jan-25 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	was it smart of me to fill my extractor and refiner queue with tasks?


[21-Jan-25 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah.  idle buildings just waste money, so keeping them busy is important


[21-Jan-25 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	given the IRL timeframe on here, they will be churin for a while


[21-Jan-25 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	note that there's no efficiency or cost advantage to queuing up bigger orders


[21-Jan-25 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I didnt see when I queued things to git larger lots of stuff


[21-Jan-25 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so if you can extract 4 FEO in 13 hours, or 8 FEO in 26 hours, the overall efficiency is the same


[21-Jan-25 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	there is an "order size" slider you can play with


[21-Jan-25 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	OH!!!


[21-Jan-25 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I see it now


[21-Jan-25 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	atm Im browsing the star map looking at systems


[21-Jan-25 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i mention this because sometimes new players slide that thing all the way to the right and have to wait like 2 weeks before anything gets produced :)   if your production time is 13 hours then you have an order size of 1 which is great


[21-Jan-25 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I know a second base is a ways off but its helping me learn some things


[21-Jan-25 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	glad I didnt notice that slider then... but I probably would have still chose the smaller amounts


[21-Jan-25 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ahhh, you already have 90% of the game figured out, which is you make some stuff and then while you wait you plan like 9 steps ahead ;)


[21-Jan-25 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	the question Ive got while looking at the star map is, should I stay in faction or look at the white non-faction systems


[21-Jan-25 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	doesn't really matter


[21-Jan-25 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	for me personally, i pick my bases based on proximity to a commodify exchange

**Zenton8787**:	I guess for ease of being able to move the resources you make


[21-Jan-25 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yeah


[21-Jan-25 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	my main base is over in the benten system, so it takes almost 2 days to fly here


[21-Jan-25 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	being a Met player, I chose Phobos for both its SIO and FEO ores


[21-Jan-25 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i'm doing electronics here, but that requires SI and FE which is also why i picked phobos


[21-Jan-25 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	speaking of me playing as a Met player. when looking for things on the map, should I more look for Ores?


[21-Jan-25 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this is hard to answer, because it depends on what you want to do


[21-Jan-25 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I guess since Im new I need to figure that out lol


[21-Jan-25 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	Im noticing a lot of repeat minerals and ores and the like across what Ive seent so far


[21-Jan-25 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	also note that your "chosen profession" of metallurgy just controls the starting materials the game gives you.   you can do anything you want


[21-Jan-25 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	thats fare


[21-Jan-25 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	metallurgy can be a bit of a challenge because the stuff is so heavy, so you can't fit a lot of it into your starter ships


[21-Jan-25 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I did see on the main site page is that you can do a fair bit of stuff in this game beyond resource extraction and processing


[21-Jan-25 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i wrote up a guide of new players in the Benten system (which isn't this system.  Phobos is in the Antares system), but it talks about a lot of important things like costs-of-goods-manufactured and the chamber of global commerce


[21-Jan-25 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so you might want to take a look (and just ignore all the stuff that says "welcome to Katoa") https://docs.google.com/document/d/10qdF6wEpZshm-ErQmjyELfjcDpuXh4ZJjlB_1Wcibk4/pub


[21-Jan-25 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but the very very short summary is:  when deciding what to do, you should be aware of how profitable (or unprofitable) it will be.  and certain planets have bonuses that make them more profitable to do certain types of industry.   you don't have to chase maximum profits, but it's an important mechanic to the game to be familiar with


[21-Jan-25 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	thats fair


[21-Jan-25 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	for instance when looking at the star map I saw there was a star with an "ICe Mine" or something like name to the planet. which was I think a 100% water plant


[21-Jan-25 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	anyway while you read that, the answer to what to do next is mostly "what would be fun to do".  some players try to be as self-sufficient as they can, by making everything they need themselves.   other players focus in one just 1 material or 1 industry, trying to become the biggest producer of that item in the universe


[21-Jan-25 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	so that would be a great one to get a build on if I wanted large amounts of water for something.. I dont know if food needs water to grow


[21-Jan-25 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I guess the thing that I find most fun for me is transportation


[21-Jan-25 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep!  you can build farms on fertile planets, or you can build hydroponics to grow things.  both require water.


[21-Jan-25 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	ahh, there are some players to do that, too.  warning:  it's hard.  the game is missing some key features to make the lives easier for logistics companies.  but it can be done.   you'll need a PRO license in order to build more ships


[21-Jan-25 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	ah


[21-Jan-25 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	for now Ill stick with the free license to get my feelers in the game


[21-Jan-25 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	smart


[21-Jan-25 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	it's the best way to get a feel for the game


[21-Jan-25 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	as well as work on building up my start


[21-Jan-25 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	COGM is a hard thing for me to wrap my mind around but I get the idea.. but the exact numbers are a bit hard


[21-Jan-25 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	specially when everything is written in acronym


[21-Jan-25 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, there are a lot of acronyms in this game :)


[21-Jan-25 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the basic idea of COGM is:   how much does it cost me to make a thing?  once you know that, you can compare it to how much you could buy it on the CX (in case it's a material you need) or how much you can sell it for (in case you're trying to sell it for profit)


[21-Jan-25 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I guess its kinda a cost of living for the workers + there salaries (cost to make the material) that determains the base cost of the good you wanna sell


[21-Jan-25 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes.  each building requires workers to run.  and those workers requires consumables (food, water, tools, etc)


[21-Jan-25 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	so even if you're pulling stuff directly out of the ground (like your extractors), you have to provide the consumables for your workers, and that will cost you something


[21-Jan-25 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	and in the case of my Pioneers, Caffinated Infusions.. Yay coffee. my kinda people


[21-Jan-25 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yep


[21-Jan-25 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	atm I have low living costs since Im new but I can see where this could grow


[21-Jan-25 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	to use the typical 3-letter code:  COF is not considered an "essential" consumable, so you don't need to provide it.  but if you do provide COF, your workers will work faster.  this means you can produce more stuff per day, which decreases your costs


[21-Jan-25 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I just use it as my example cause I like coffee.. but yes, RAT and DW are essential


[21-Jan-25 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	and OVE


[21-Jan-25 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	the other thing to know is that your production buildings (like your extractor) will slowly degrade overtime, making them slower.  you'll need to repair them with materials.  but don't worry about this now, you don't have to deal with this for at least 2 months


[21-Jan-25 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	but this also adds to the cost of producing goods


[21-Jan-25 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	so IRL degradation time aswell


[21-Jan-25 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I did see the repair button on my list of buildings


[21-Jan-25 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	2 days from benton isnt that bad I guess. I was looking at things in a neighbor star cluster but ofc I am still unsure what to produce yet


[21-Jan-25 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i should also mention that some people like to fly out into the middle of absolute nowhere and try to survive.  i've never been brave enough to try that :)


[21-Jan-25 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	the true survivalists


[21-Jan-25 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	how do you build onto a planets population?


[21-Jan-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	you need to build up the "population infrastructure" on a planet, which are buildings that can support certain worker types


[21-Jan-25 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	would those be like the HABs the tutorial told me to make for my pioneers


[21-Jan-25 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	no.  HABs are buildings for your base.  but planetary buildings are something different


[21-Jan-25 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	open up a new buffer with this command:   POPI ZV-307d


[21-Jan-25 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	ok


[21-Jan-25 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	this will show you the infrastructure buildings for Phobos.  for example, there are 9 "Safety Stations"


[21-Jan-25 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	I would assume that the "Planetary Projects" are communal projects for the betterment of the whole planet


[21-Jan-25 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	they can be.  anyone can contribute to them.  but generally the government of a planet does most of the contributions


[21-Jan-25 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zenton8787**:	ah. I do see that atm there is only 1 thing to contribute to. the shipyard. which was last added to about a year ago

[21-Jan-25 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jan-25 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Deckss**:	with motions can be withdrawn by parliament and the governor


[21-Jan-25 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	yes, taxes go into the bank account of the government.  anyone on parliament can propose a motion to spend that money

**Archiel**:	A reminder to everyone that Phobos has had a policy of offering grants to new or small planets in ANT space that need money to help make their upgrades. Phobos has a nice store of income right now, and it doesn't do any good just sitting there. So if you have a public good in mind in the region, please let someone on the Phobos team know (like me!)

[11-Feb-25 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	if i understand correctly, this is a grant for people trying to settle new *planets* nearby, not a people here on phobos with new bases


[11-Feb-25 10:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aaron987**:	I though diversifying my production lines would be a good idea: Starting as a metalurgist I went extractor collector farrmstead rig and smelter


[11-Feb-25 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aaron987**:	ohhhh my bad, I saw free money and I thought that as for me xD


[11-Feb-25 10:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aaron987**:	now I reflect on this I think I should have go 4 extractor 1 semlter and and another home for the pioneers


[11-Feb-25 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	as a new player on antares space, you absolutely can get other grants, though :)


[11-Feb-25 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	are you on any of the discord servers, like the UFO discord server?


[11-Feb-25 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aaron987**:	to be honest I just connefcted to PU discord but Have not really checked it yet


[11-Feb-25 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	there are a lot of discord servers out there.  pretty much every major corp and co-op run their own server.


[11-Feb-25 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	i would join this one:  https://discord.gg/wap7QZyz


[11-Feb-25 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**eminence32**:	and check out the "Galactic Deals" channel (in particular the post about the ADI -- Antares Development Initiative).  it will send you to yet another discord server, though

**Archiel**:	Hi everyone, we had a motion for a grant from Tanda to develop two new construction planets, Lom Palanka and Black Mesa, on Antares I and one jump away. Details in this discord convo on UFO: https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/866583650278441000/1340463135974490214


[15-Feb-25 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	The second motion for the regional development fund is a motion to upgrade the University on Origo, a key chemistry planet in the region. This request is brought forth by Finest_One.

[15-Feb-25 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	And the third motion for regional development is an upgrade to the Heph warehouse to 5k/5k by Dzentak. Large warehouses get expensive, but Heph is somewhat unique in that it will host two gateways and is commonly used by shipbuilders.


[15-Feb-25 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dzentak**:	<3


[15-Feb-25 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Generally 2k/2k is the sweet spot for warehouse upgrades in my opinion, so if other planets are in need, let us know!

**Archiel**:	The core plan establishes the cheapest possible minimum upkeep- keeping satisfaction above 50% is required to prevent loss of population, which can happen quite quickly when it drops below that level. Currently we have a sizable deficit of scientists- despite solid growth in the population, the job demand has continued to grow, so I'd like to move aggressively to close this gap up.


[25-Feb-25 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Education can be effective in the 50%-70% range, but if the POPI materials are available, we may go a bit higher in the short term.


[25-Feb-25 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I've sent my first two 2k/2k ships of POPI mats up, and since some key materials including PFE/OLF/SOI are in short supply on the market, I will be upgrading the PAR a bit to help with comfort, and ensure the culture and education doesn't get capped.


[25-Feb-25 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	If you produce OFF, HOG, PFE, SOI, OLF, HAB and can sell directly to me at a decent price, please reach out. There's also room for DEC, HD, and HOG.


[25-Feb-25 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	And since there's a lot of nerds here, here are some fun charts. For more detail, please take a look at the sheets!

**Archiel**:	Finally, a reminder that Phobos runs a infrastucture development grant that can help underdeveloped planets add ADMs, COGCs, infrastructure, and warehouses up to 2k. Contract a Phobos MP with your proposal.

**Arbids**:	It's definitely much more expensive to start out into electronics. It's much better to start out into something Pioneers produce. Once you have a decent reliable cash flow, then you can start looking into electronics..

**Archiel**:	Phobos government update- filled the most important and most cost effective upkeep items again. Working hard on getting those needs raised. We had solid growth last week but need to keep things growing. Happiness will continue to rise since it's averaged over the previous couple of weeks.


[09-Mar-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Also we've got a newly upgraded Park, which will help with comfort, which is often the most challenging to fill on large mixed-population planets.

[28-Mar-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	uh well, just make the screen to your liking


[28-Mar-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	on the left is the BS buffer


[28-Mar-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**smoogle**:	I've played the game for three minutes, whatever I was supposed to do was probably in those windows but no idea what they were


[28-Mar-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	you will want inventory, production, and workforce on your main screen


[28-Mar-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	you click the lighter colored section on the buffer window and drag onto your blank areas on base


[28-Mar-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	then you resize as needed


[28-Mar-25 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**smoogle**:	ok thank you, I think INV and PROD were what I unintentionally closed


[28-Mar-25 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	yes, those are most important


[28-Mar-25 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	welcome to the game


[28-Mar-25 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**smoogle**:	Thank you. I've started my first production line, which will take 8 hours. Is there anything else for a new player to progress through until then?


[28-Mar-25 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**smoogle**:	or just come back in 8?


[28-Mar-25 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	That's about it, unless you want to start getting obsessed with planning future growth


[28-Mar-25 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	I familiarized myself with the different materials and production chains, then I explored the galaxy planets and such


[28-Mar-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	just make sure you follow the tutorial as the rewards are quite good for a new player

**SilentReaper**:	Hello Phobos! FIOC is looking to bring on new members to join the group. We operate different than other corps in that we share everything internally. We focus on production in stead of the generation of cash. This allows us to work more as a group, building complimentary bases to maximize outputs. If you're interested in how we do things, come check out our welcome page for more information. https://discord.gg/WNgrAzMdhx


[07-Apr-25 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I am issuing a Phobos Development Grant for the construction of SST + INF + ART on Vulcan - Vulcan is a key metallurgy planet in Antares, and as Deimos maxes out and the demand for ASMs increases, Vulcan becomes more and more important.

**Frentic**:	3 of the biggest players.. ParisInSpringtime, RiseOfFilth and FireFreak...


[12-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	instead of MM discussions we should be having endgame discussions... way more important. Above 20 HQ levels this game becomes unbearable.


[12-Apr-25 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	endgame would have been the gateways, but the largest players had no reason to participate in that


[12-Apr-25 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	True, logistics is one of the key issues this game needs to tackle, imho. Gateways are a step in that direction but something to automate logistics is desperately needed. Maybe a module in ships where you can load drones and configure them... idk.

**Hal98**:	Devs don't listen tho


[12-Apr-25 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Apr-25 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Frentic**:	...with solutions* to our requests.


[12-Apr-25 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Apr-25 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	yeah its hard to say and I don't really know either


[12-Apr-25 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	They do listen, but I think this latest bundle rollout was the wrong way to go about it


[12-Apr-25 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	nobody was ever going to be happy with it, I think


[12-Apr-25 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	I dont want a bundle


[12-Apr-25 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	that i have to cart off to be bundled


[12-Apr-25 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hal98**:	I think people were wanting being able to make their own package of what ever they wanted


[12-Apr-25 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	just make a bundle option on the CX that costs like 100 credits and it takes the ask of all the items and tells you the cost - then you select yes or no


[12-Apr-25 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	make it so you can toggle each item in the bundle on or off, since some bases dont need all items


[12-Apr-25 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Akyan**:	Hi folks, I'm submitting a request for funding on behalf of Deimos to upgrade the ART POPI from 7->8, which will cost around 4.5m AIC. The tax income on the planet has yet to break even to pay upkeep costs, so not in a position to fund such an upgrade at the moment. As such I'd like to appeal to the Phobos fund. Let me know if the current governers/MPs would support such a fund request. Thanks


[13-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	I think Phobos should provide loans to other ANT space govs. Low interest loans for planetary development.


[13-Apr-25 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	Somewhere in the region of 1 or 2% interest per week makes sense imo.


[13-Apr-25 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	I would definitely take one for Aceland, I think


[13-Apr-25 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Apr-25 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Finest_One**:	If the building is built its "in use" besides that Population will redistribute on the planet for everyone every pop Cycle. You can see the planets Pop Cycle by clicking on the Workforce Population # in the planet menu or just using Code POPR (planet ID)

**TRUEnterprises**:	There's enough of a market that you can put in a bid for LD and make up that deficit


[17-Apr-25 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TRUEnterprises**:	I sell LD to the CX from time to time

**Datucis**:	How do you purchase items you need on this? All i see are people with shipping, nothing up for sale


[19-Apr-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Tanda**:	all sales and purchases generally take place on the CX. Try the command CXL in a new buffer and explore from there


[19-Apr-25 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Datucis**:	I figured it out :D thanks. I was looking at the local markets and not the commodity exchange

**Archiel**:	Hi everyone, it's time for Phobos Government Update! We are expecting some population shifts as we approach the IDC changes. We have had some good grants go out, including a big set of upgrades for Nike. Overall, we are expecting a lot of the IDC to move to lower tier pop electronics as people move towards drones or ship components (which includes the LIS chain). Give me a shout if you are planning big moves.


[26-Apr-25 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	I will continue running education to maintain pops until they stabilize without growing the low tiers too much- since we can move those very quickly with festivals if needed.


[26-Apr-25 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	As always, the public ledger is available at: http://oogcapitalmanagement.com/r/phobos
