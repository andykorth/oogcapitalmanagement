Good channel.  Dunno how to start it ...

Metallurgy on 'a' with LIO extraction,

ResExt on 'c' with TCO, O, TIO, 

and it's a 10-day weekly flip/flop on 'b' between Chem & ResExt, with H2O & BER, and AML's I think.


[03-Jul-24 07:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
Election started on `ADM SE-648a`  (it's where I make my HCC)


[06-Jul-24 12:27 PM] mrsmith33#0000
Need one more vote on SE-648c to be above nano

[07-Jul-24 09:53 PM] tuffyless#0000
^^bump.  Vote MrSmith


[07-Jul-24 10:14 PM] archielvahr#0000
I messaged Harpercz to suggest he vote for MrSmith


[07-Jul-24 10:15 PM] archielvahr#0000
also did @martin1194  vote there? I only see 2 OOG votes (assuming it's Tuffy and MrSmith)


[07-Jul-24 11:33 PM] martin1194#0000
maybe not yet


[07-Jul-24 11:33 PM] martin1194#0000

[08-Jul-24 12:04 AM] martin1194#0000
I was voted already.


[08-Jul-24 12:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
Thanks for checking!


[08-Jul-24 12:15 AM] martin1194#0000
As I remember, I run the Election. I voted MrSmith33 since I know I am no change in it :Pepepains:


[08-Jul-24 12:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
So I think we're missing a vote, which means either Tuffy or MrSmith didn't vote..? maybe?


[08-Jul-24 12:25 AM] archielvahr#0000
But I guess we're good, Harpercz did change his vote üôÇ


[08-Jul-24 01:40 AM] mrsmith33#0000
But I want pos #2 üò≠


[08-Jul-24 01:50 AM] mrsmith33#0000

[08-Jul-24 01:51 AM] mrsmith33#0000
I still have my vote on him, but without it Rise will be below nano


[08-Jul-24 02:18 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Someone moved vote from nano to Rise, thanks

elections start on 648c tomorrow morning.  We don't have anyone running?


[24-Aug-24 09:57 PM] archielvahr#0000
That's a TI extraction planet? we probably don't have too many there

Come to GM-332d, 3rd most glorious of all TIO planets. Only 3 days jump at slow speeds

[25-Aug-24 02:16 AM] akyantor#0000
I don't love being in parliment on two planets, but thrown my hat in the ring as it's a somewhat simple one to look after.


[25-Aug-24 02:18 AM] akyantor#0000
And the OOG tracker actually has quite a few of us there.. up-to 10 bases as of 2024-08-10


[25-Aug-24 03:09 AM] akyantor#0000
It's oddly had no motions since the expansion came out, so it's not for want of planetary funds to keep things running.


[25-Aug-24 03:12 AM] akyantor#0000
Looks like MoonSugarTravels is volunteering to take it on too


[25-Aug-24 03:12 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd be minded to take a the MP seat rather than the governer position, just to view the accounts.


[25-Aug-24 06:47 AM] katinga#0000
I am on A and C


[25-Aug-24 06:56 AM] akyantor#0000
Looks like the current governor won't be around much longer.

[25-Aug-24 06:56 AM] akyantor#0000
That's already more votes than the last election. üòõ


[25-Aug-24 06:57 AM] katinga#0000
I'm actually surprised Rise isn't running.  Did he forget?


[25-Aug-24 06:57 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, not sure. He's on soooo many planets, and on this one he doesn't have a base. He's perhaps let it drop


[25-Aug-24 06:59 AM] katinga#0000
he's in the history... so maybe he left the planet?


[25-Aug-24 06:59 AM] akyantor#0000
He put himself forward on even planets he didn't have a base on when the expansion first came out.


[25-Aug-24 06:59 AM] akyantor#0000
But also possible he dropped a base


[25-Aug-24 07:00 AM] katinga#0000
I keep wanting to call that other guy "crayon jarvis"

Someone switched their vote so now I'm winning. üò± I really didn't plan on being a governer on a second planet. üòõ


[25-Aug-24 10:23 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, it's quite a simple one


[25-Aug-24 10:36 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Want me not to vote for you?


[25-Aug-24 10:36 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I see OOG, I vote


[25-Aug-24 10:38 AM] akyantor#0000
It's fine. I'll take it on the for the short term. I at least caused the pop shortage, so may as well take on getting it straight. üòõ


[27-Aug-24 02:15 AM] akyantor#0000
I changed my mind, @shrewdsun_88540 would you mind switching your vote. I'll take the second seat, probably best to focus on my expansion project for now. üôÇ

[27-Aug-24 01:27 PM] akyantor#0000
Cool. They are ahead. I'll be the MP. üôÇ


[28-Aug-24 03:10 PM] akyantor#0000
FYI - I've shipped backup CoGC and SST OFF supplies to SE-648c, just in case the current governor doesn't wake up.


[28-Aug-24 03:10 PM] akyantor#0000
I needed to pick up my TCO/O/TI anyway. üôÇ


[28-Aug-24 03:12 PM] mrsmith33#0000
The Crayon guy is pretty bad at supplying stuff


[28-Aug-24 03:12 PM] akyantor#0000
Bit of a red flag that the SST isn't fed... when there's less than 5% pop buffer


[28-Aug-24 03:13 PM] akyantor#0000
Hopefully this other person that takes over will have a better handle on it, in the meantime not chancing it being missed in the short term.


[28-Aug-24 03:22 PM] katinga#0000
crayon guy.  lol  I love it when I rub off on people


[29-Aug-24 03:24 PM] akyantor#0000
The wild thing is Crayon is still putting themself up for election. ü§Ø


[31-Aug-24 10:12 AM] katinga#0000

[10-Oct-24 03:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[10-Oct-24 03:41 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

Usually he forgets to vote for himself.


[24-Oct-24 06:24 AM] katinga#0000
he's on Romulus now, too


[24-Oct-24 06:25 AM] katinga#0000
I wish he'd forget to click Run


[24-Oct-24 06:27 AM] katinga#0000
could this guy be a bot?  we literally just ended an election on Romulus and he's already hit Run again.  Does this guy post in chats?

Nah he never talks, we suspect he doesn't speak english. He doesn't reply to messages either
