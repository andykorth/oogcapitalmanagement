@Project Coordinator Made this singular one channel category just in case there's anything in relation to ADI, mainly such as planning just so it doesn't get washed away, to use.


[01-Apr-24 10:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
I plan on making this place a bit more organized in the coming days, and I'd like to actually kick off something such as maybe the shipping project, so I just thought having an actual formal place would be important in planning that out.


[01-Apr-24 10:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
As coordinators you don't really have any expectation to do anything since I just randomly gave you the role - but you can if you want, mainly managing admission within #server-airlock but that's up to you to do.


[01-Apr-24 10:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Otherwise if people are actually interested in helping out fully the end goal would be to have a coordinator per project, granted there's nothing to coordinate right now, but just laying the groundwork for the future.


[01-Apr-24 10:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
If you don't want/care to be a coordinator just let me know, no pressure, just picked the people who I thought would be interested out of anyone else.


[01-Apr-24 10:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
That and with permissions I'd rather not just give it out to anybody either.


[01-Apr-24 10:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Atm you should be able to edit people's nicknames, manage roles, and kick people, if you think you should have anything else just give me a shout.


[01-Apr-24 10:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Let me know if you have any suggestions or concerns whatsoever and we'll work on them.


[01-Apr-24 11:12 AM] jvaler#0000
gotcha gotcha

i'll probably occasionally introduce people in #server-airlock but a lot of the time i don't really have the energy/patience for it.

on projects, i've been thinking of a few ideas lately but haven't thought of anything good yet imo. will let you know though


[01-Apr-24 11:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Of course, that works fine for me. ^^


[01-Apr-24 11:54 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
as exciting as coordinating is to me I've got far too much on my plate to do much for ADI *yet*, but I'm definitely interested. I know Coolfeather2 has lots of technical knowledge and interest in making a shipping tool, might be a good person to ask for help with that project.


[01-Apr-24 11:55 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Maybe just a super simple first project to coordinate could be a tiny DW/RAT operation. Harmonia, Norwick, and Ice Station Alpha. It's a super easy and profitable start in Antares


[01-Apr-24 12:17 PM] jvaler#0000
personally i wanna try to avoid overlapping bases with AA, but maybe that's not as big of a deal as i thought it was seeing how few ADI members are actually in both servers


[01-Apr-24 12:17 PM] jvaler#0000
that being harmonia and norwick, AA just uses boucher instead of ISA


[01-Apr-24 12:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's fine.


[01-Apr-24 12:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
fair, that is a good point


[01-Apr-24 12:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
pushing people to join AFC would also help boost our shipping program, since Rise handles all that for ACF. Could have a pretty massive fleet of starter ships, lol


[01-Apr-24 12:28 PM] flor2081#0000
I haven't been very active lately so I've got no clue what this shipping project even is hahah


[01-Apr-24 12:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Essentially my goal is to have several regular routes that members here can do often.


[01-Apr-24 12:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'd like to have it so that we have regular ships available going from ANT to the major planets along with some that take to other planets further out.


[01-Apr-24 12:29 PM] flor2081#0000
ah, that's pretty useful


[01-Apr-24 12:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
People would be well compensated for it.


[01-Apr-24 12:29 PM] flor2081#0000
could also just make 1 guy have 50 ships, just like bojidar in OOG

üòÜ 

[01-Apr-24 12:30 PM] flor2081#0000
damn its increased to 89 already, that guy just never stops


[01-Apr-24 12:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
89 ships?


[01-Apr-24 12:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Damn.


[01-Apr-24 12:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not sure we'll be running that kind of operation.


[01-Apr-24 12:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although I've funded several people for ship upgrades for that specific reason.


[01-Apr-24 12:35 PM] flor2081#0000
haha, just need to find someone that doesn't mind all the clicks


[01-Apr-24 12:36 PM] flor2081#0000
imagine those thousands of clicks to ship so many stuff.. damn


[01-Apr-24 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah.


[01-Apr-24 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't know, I think having a major shipping network around our area of operation would massively help out people.


[01-Apr-24 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Personally I've really enjoyed the shipping to and from Harmonia/Life and Griffonstone, since Griffonstone alone takes about a day and a half for a full resupply and then for it to come back.


[01-Apr-24 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
If we had several bases here on griffonstone we could have 3/4 people getting restocked at once, and then maybe even 3/4 people getting their outputs sent to the CX to reduce overhang.


[01-Apr-24 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Same with Harmonia and Life, they take a good bit of my ships time away, imagine if we could restock multiple people's bases and then send them off to other places.


[01-Apr-24 01:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it could definitely help out quite a bit, we'd just need to work out how to manage it effectively.


[01-Apr-24 01:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I do want it to be a bit more formal than just, ship available here.


[01-Apr-24 01:09 PM] jvaler#0000
i am planning on making a personal giffonstone base soon!


[01-Apr-24 01:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well there we go then.


[01-Apr-24 01:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
My point exactly.


[01-Apr-24 01:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Griffonstone is a pretty good opportunity for people and I'd be willing and looking into funding some bases there for people to get into the higher tier commodities.


[01-Apr-24 01:17 PM] flor2081#0000
I think this would be easiest if you connect it to a certain project aswell


[01-Apr-24 01:17 PM] flor2081#0000
like doing HAL->CL->? on griffon, attracts lots of new people that are willing to lend their ship for that


[01-Apr-24 01:18 PM] flor2081#0000
and then you've got the basics already


[01-Apr-24 01:18 PM] flor2081#0000
kindof like AA I think, that's probably how that started too haha


[01-Apr-24 01:19 PM] flor2081#0000
I do agree with trying to not overlap too much with AA though


[01-Apr-24 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
is co-op EXT/CHP bases like DNPC viable on griffonstone?


[01-Apr-24 01:23 PM] flor2081#0000
eh no


[01-Apr-24 01:23 PM] flor2081#0000
üòÑ


[01-Apr-24 01:23 PM] flor2081#0000
would be a waste of space to mine the HAL on griffonstone


[01-Apr-24 01:24 PM] jvaler#0000
damn


[01-Apr-24 01:25 PM] flor2081#0000
yeah the hal deposit there really isnt great


[01-Apr-24 03:28 PM] jvaler#0000
i mean it's no YK-005d but it's not terrible either

[01-Apr-24 03:32 PM] jvaler#0000
though i suppose shipping HAL is actually not that big of an issue because you need *something* in your cargo hold on the trip to griffonstone


[28-May-24 06:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
does the dyno bot have the ability to do reaction roles? if so you could automate all these planet roles


[28-May-24 07:09 PM] jvaler#0000
not sure about that, will look into it soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è


[29-May-24 01:37 AM] flor2081#0000
Carlbot is nice and easy to use, they use that in GTU too


[29-May-24 01:38 AM] flor2081#0000
I can help set that up if you want


[29-May-24 05:38 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah we use yagpdb.bot in KAWA and it was fairly easy to set up. I've seen carlbot used more though, seems good


[29-May-24 05:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
dyno has good reviews but I passed on it cause it almost seems like it had *too* many features and I didn't plan to use most of them


[29-May-24 05:39 PM] jvaler#0000
i think i've figured out how to possibly do it with dyno. i'll use reaction roles for project roles like AGP, but use the `?rank` system for the dozens of planet roles


[29-May-24 05:39 PM] jvaler#0000
that way there isn't a giant dropdown or dozens of buttons


[29-May-24 05:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
nice


[29-May-24 05:40 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd just prefer to minimize the number of different bots with overlapping features in the server. dyno is already semi integrated from australis so i'll keep it while it still works for us

[31-May-24 12:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
@jvaler I saw you were offering 0 interest loans for WCB upgrades. Maybe we could make that a standard offering for ADI if people are interested?


[31-May-24 12:12 PM] jvaler#0000
wait, saw me offering loans for WCB upgrades?


[31-May-24 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
I thought I saw you offer that to someone in here


[31-May-24 12:12 PM] jvaler#0000
i thought that was related to base expansions


[31-May-24 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
Am I spreading misinformation?


[31-May-24 12:13 PM] jvaler#0000
possibly...


[31-May-24 12:13 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd direct someone to AA for something like that


[31-May-24 12:13 PM] jvaler#0000
rise is better equipped for that since they're a shipbuilder with lots of capital


[31-May-24 12:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
Fair enough. The idea makes a lot less sense if you weren‚Äôt offering it in the first place üòÖ


[31-May-24 12:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
I must have misread something


[31-May-24 12:14 PM] jvaler#0000
lol it's okay


[31-May-24 12:14 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe it was this? but it was about helping someone's C buffer

[31-May-24 12:15 PM] jvaler#0000
and then nyan's was unspecified


[31-May-24 12:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ah yeah I think that was it


[31-May-24 12:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
My reading comprehension is mid at best


[31-May-24 12:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
But anyway, I was just thinking about what sorts of things might be useful to a slightly more established new player. It seems like we have a lot of people in the 2-3 bases, 0-1 WCB range


[31-May-24 12:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
And thanks to a certain EDC deal, I have a lot more money than I can spend on expansion in the near term üòÑ


[31-May-24 12:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
But just ideas, anyway. I think between the new player grants, internal market, and just general community for brainstorming there‚Äôs a solid amount of support here


[31-May-24 12:25 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm... i like the idea, but i don't think it's feasable for me to fund. those ships aren't cheap, and i can't make them myself.


[31-May-24 12:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôd pitch in if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in doing. I‚Äôm not trying to spend your money for you üòÑ


[31-May-24 12:26 PM] jvaler#0000
i could put out a PSA to direct them to rise in AA though?
i'm sure they won't mind the 2-4 week waitlist üò¨


[31-May-24 12:27 PM] jvaler#0000
it's not just funding but a matter of sourcing it cost effectively too


[31-May-24 12:28 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't like throwing my hands up and saying idk, but i've already got so many antares planets dedicated to other things like co-ops and private deals


[31-May-24 12:28 PM] jvaler#0000
don't feasibly see myself fitting in WCB upgrade prod


[31-May-24 12:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
I was thinking more of helping fund the new player upgrade deals that are out there


[31-May-24 12:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
But maybe I‚Äôll look at what all it takes to make an WCB upgrade


[31-May-24 12:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
The allure of just printing more RATs has faded just a little now that I make over 1k a day üòÑ


[31-May-24 12:32 PM] jvaler#0000
is schaitr reliable? that's quite a good deal over there


[31-May-24 12:32 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think so - I believe evayoo bought from them recently. That‚Äôs also how I got my first WCB long long ago üòÑ


[31-May-24 12:33 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah that's right
iirc the delivery time was quite long on that though


[31-May-24 12:33 PM] jvaler#0000
lemme ask


[31-May-24 12:34 PM] jvaler#0000
err wait, before i bring up the plan


[31-May-24 12:36 PM] jvaler#0000
no nvm, this is a good idea. cause with the 750k grant they make ~20-30k/d on deimos AL, which would take about a month to save up for that WCB


[31-May-24 12:36 PM] jvaler#0000
that's a long time


[31-May-24 12:36 PM] jvaler#0000
so


[31-May-24 12:41 PM] jvaler#0000
oh also @archielvahr i think you should have coordinator, to reflect your help in funding AGP


[31-May-24 12:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sure


[31-May-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Just ping me any time someone needs grants, cause I don't always check all my discords


[31-May-24 12:44 PM] jvaler#0000
gotcha


[31-May-24 12:44 PM] jvaler#0000
i'll try to spread the demand evenly though


[31-May-24 12:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
Sure üôÇ


[31-May-24 01:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
We could offer a 0% 60 day loan for the first WCB? Since it‚Äôll take them about a month to buy otherwise, that should give plenty of time to pay it off


[31-May-24 01:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
And that way shaitr doesn‚Äôt get a huge wave of people all at once. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs very many people in the server now who are still on 2 starter ships


[31-May-24 01:18 PM] jvaler#0000
really? i was thinking we still had like 3-5 people on double starters


[31-May-24 01:18 PM] jvaler#0000
cause for a deimos base all you really need is 1 WCB


[31-May-24 01:18 PM] jvaler#0000
2 is nice but


[31-May-24 01:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
3-5 isn‚Äôt too many üòÑ


[31-May-24 01:19 PM] jvaler#0000
ah


[31-May-24 01:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
That‚Äôs 3.25M of loans if we cover the 650k fee


[31-May-24 01:21 PM] jvaler#0000
gotta cover the LHP/SSC too


[31-May-24 01:21 PM] jvaler#0000
will calculate in a sec


[31-May-24 01:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
Wow, that‚Äôs a lot less upgrades than I expected


[31-May-24 01:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
Which either means that this is a really good idea, or a really bad one üòÑ


[31-May-24 01:33 PM] jvaler#0000
lololol


[31-May-24 01:33 PM] jvaler#0000
with the power of friendship we can prevail


[31-May-24 01:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think I would be able to do about 10M of loans for this


[31-May-24 01:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
So I guess the other important part is making sure we don‚Äôt swamp shaitr with upgrade requests if we do this


[31-May-24 01:35 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah i'm going to be contacting them about this


[31-May-24 01:35 PM] jvaler#0000
because pickup is in MOR, my idea is to pre-order a set amount to be bulk shipped to ANT


[31-May-24 01:36 PM] jvaler#0000
that way we don't have half a dozen people scrambling to ship a package that can't fit in a starter


[31-May-24 01:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
Ooooo good idea if we can swing it


[31-May-24 01:36 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm mhm


[31-May-24 01:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
If shaitr isn‚Äôt okay selling all of those, I might be able to buy some through OOG as well


[31-May-24 01:38 PM] jvaler#0000
worried about OOG prices, they seem pretty steep


[31-May-24 01:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
If we had to go that route, I‚Äôd see about buying them at internal prices and eating the difference. But we can cross that bridge if we come to it üòÑ


[31-May-24 01:42 PM] jvaler#0000
alr


[31-May-24 03:43 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I think it would be fine to do some OOG ships at internal prices. We don't discount internally as heavily as other corps, people are still supposed to make a profit. We aren't really a centrally managed corp. 

internal price had been 4.6m for the same ship we sell. 

I think we are constrained mostly on SKF items or engines.  It's possible we have WCB upgrade items floating around. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Generally they should be on the CX if they are available though.


[31-May-24 04:03 PM] jvaler#0000
4.6mil LCB is comparable to rise, i'm down with that


[31-May-24 04:03 PM] jvaler#0000
we'll see though

{Reactions}
üëç 

[31-May-24 04:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
oh, whole ships? I was originally just thinking about buying whatever upgrade kits we couldn't source from schaitr internally if people were okay selling them for that purpose


[31-May-24 04:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
through OOG, that is


[31-May-24 04:31 PM] jvaler#0000
right no it'll just be kits, was just using the LCB ship price archiel gave as a frame of reference

{Reactions}

[31-May-24 04:31 PM] sidepipe#0000

[31-May-24 05:00 PM] archielvahr#0000

before i post a poll, wanna clear something up. dunno if we discussed and i forgot or something


[07-Jun-24 07:31 PM] jvaler#0000
this will operate like AGP right? no repayment expected?


[07-Jun-24 07:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
Good question - I was originally thinking 0 interest loans but that might be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth for a group buy like this


[07-Jun-24 07:39 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm actually leaning towards that tbh... at least, if the afabs i have listed don't sell soon. cause with the possible volume of requests i'd totally run out of money

I can cover the rest if you prefer it to be free, but either way works for me üôÇ


[07-Jun-24 07:41 PM] jvaler#0000
if you're sure...


[07-Jun-24 07:41 PM] jvaler#0000
i guess it makes sense to maintain the spirit of AGP and have it be free


[07-Jun-24 07:41 PM] jvaler#0000
idk


[07-Jun-24 07:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
I go back and forth

Loans might be nicer for those who already worked their way up, and it‚Äôs still basically free


[07-Jun-24 07:43 PM] jvaler#0000
mm yeah maybe. it doesn't feel good to get too many handouts, so just giving people a step-up that they can repay makes sense


[07-Jun-24 07:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs ultimately up to you, since you‚Äôre the administrator - you‚Äôre putting in a good chunk of money as well, so I trust your judgement üòÅ


[07-Jun-24 07:48 PM] jvaler#0000
it looks like it's mostly your money though üò≠


[07-Jun-24 07:48 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't wanna hold you hostage


[07-Jun-24 07:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
How many upgrades would you anticipate? Rough guess


[07-Jun-24 07:49 PM] jvaler#0000
there's a maximum possible of 34... so if say half of them want one it'd be 17


[07-Jun-24 07:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
And one upgrade kit is 750k right?


[07-Jun-24 07:49 PM] jvaler#0000
650k without LHP+SSC


[07-Jun-24 07:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
So 23M max if everyone goes for it and we don‚Äôt provide LHP etc


[07-Jun-24 07:51 PM] jvaler#0000
well i don't wanna leave everyone scrambling for LHP, so it should be covered under the loan right?


[07-Jun-24 07:52 PM] jvaler#0000
CX LHP is getting pricey though so it could be up to +90k AIC

wait i calculated that wrong, LHP would replace BHP


[07-Jun-24 07:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
Wanna go 50/50 on 5 upgrade kits + requisite plates and try doing 0% loans for those on a first-come-first-serve basis?


[07-Jun-24 07:53 PM] sidepipe#0000
If there‚Äôs interest we can keep doing that and if we decide to go free later we can just forgive the loans üòÑ


[07-Jun-24 07:55 PM] jvaler#0000
i feel like 5 will get eaten up quick, and there's a growing queue i'm told

[07-Jun-24 07:55 PM] jvaler#0000
basically


[07-Jun-24 07:56 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm down to go 50/50 though


[07-Jun-24 07:57 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm gonna go run that poll non-committal-y

then i gotta do homework


[07-Jun-24 07:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
50/50 is definitely good with me üòÑ


[07-Jun-24 07:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
So 8-10 ships for the first round maybe?


[07-Jun-24 08:03 PM] jvaler#0000
that sounds perfect


[07-Jun-24 08:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Would people be allowed to get upgrades if they already got the grant ?


[07-Jun-24 08:19 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm


[07-Jun-24 08:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think the grant being free and then the upgrade being a 0% interest loan is fair progression


[08-Jun-24 04:06 AM] flor2081#0000
what kind of shady business are you in that you suddenly have 40m in cash?? üòÇ


[08-Jun-24 07:39 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Option C: do it like I do it KAWA, first upgrade free, second one with loan ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø not saying that's the best option, just pointing out that it's there

I do all the contracts for allocater‚Äôs base deal in exchange for a cut. It‚Äôs been a lot of fun to organize tbh


[08-Jun-24 09:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
Good üòÑ

A big part of why I started doing this is because I was kinda tired of the earlier game grind and wanted to get more into the logistics of the game. I figure by doing this we can do the same for some of the poor AL haulers in the group


[08-Jun-24 09:30 AM] jvaler#0000

Ah hahah makes sense


[08-Jun-24 10:07 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
honestly fair. handing out free ships to KAWA is the only reason I'd probably consider one


[08-Jun-24 10:11 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I like the interesting puzzle of trading outside of a corp that is by nature very internally focused though. It's an amusing challenge trying to be the sort of membrane between a surprisingly large isolated economy and the larger community. Treating KAWA like one big company instead of a corp when trading. If I built an IDC farm I don't think anyone would ever hear much from us, lol


[08-Jun-24 10:11 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I did consider a CBx farm like lowstrife though. Those marketmakers are good, and it would also supply our shipbuilding line ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[08-Jun-24 11:00 AM] sidepipe#0000
I feel like this has been a pretty good deal for everyone involved. OOG investors benefit from the returns. Allocater and I get a slice from organizing it. The players who build the bases get a solid fixed income per week (even in the cases where we lacked ENG, we‚Äôve just paid out the same per week)


[08-Jun-24 11:01 AM] sidepipe#0000
And a free EDC base after 50 days if they want to keep it


[08-Jun-24 11:02 AM] sidepipe#0000
I liked that bit a lot. I really dislike deals that lease bases in perpetuity, especially for newer players. It can feel exploitative (though it isn‚Äôt always)

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[08-Jun-24 11:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think the KAWA model for corps is pretty interesting. We don‚Äôt do fixed prices internally and I prefer it that way, but I think both methods have their pros and cons üòÑ


[12-Jun-24 09:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
@jvaler will you need any cash up front for the ship order?

[21-Jun-24 07:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
What‚Äôre you looking for?


[21-Jun-24 07:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The INS project.
- 2 INS bases, expected 2.5 mil each (base + 5 days supplies)
- 1 BMP base, expected 1.5 mil (base + 5 days)

Tanda was planning to do one of the INS bases so they can pitch in some amount and another person wanted to do the BMP base, they also probably plan on pitching in like half or third


[21-Jun-24 07:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We might be adding more but that is it for now


[21-Jun-24 07:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Sounds good - what‚Äôs the ROIs for those bases?


[21-Jun-24 07:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I could probably do more 0% interest loans, just want to find a length that makes sense üôÇ


[21-Jun-24 08:04 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
At the current price, 34d for INS, but we hope to lower it so closer to 40's as we get there


[21-Jun-24 08:05 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The PE base is about 20d


[21-Jun-24 08:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
Would somewhere in the 60-90 day payback work?


[21-Jun-24 08:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
At that range I‚Äôd be happy to cover up to the whole 6.5M


[21-Jun-24 08:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Sounds good to me, hopefully the base owners are ok with it too


[21-Jun-24 09:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
If not we can figure something out üòÑ


[29-Jun-24 12:42 PM] archielvahr#0000
I assume there's no particular guidelines about sending returning players another grant.

Errrr, maybe he never gone one. The name Shrewdsun is super familiar but I guess I'm mis-remembering something


[29-Jun-24 03:12 PM] jvaler#0000
COLIQed players are 100% eligible, but maybe not ones with millions in loans already given to them. 

all the power to them to skip to mid-to-late-game PrUn, but that kinda excludes them from the "less developed" clause of #agp-information


[29-Jun-24 03:13 PM] jvaler#0000
i myself have a 2mil outstanding loan with them lmfao

i totally forgot


[06-Aug-24 05:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
Good question - depends on 2 things:
1. Has anyone paid off their ships yet?
2. Are you planning on doing another round of the WKP?


[06-Aug-24 05:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
Cause if there‚Äôs another round, we can just keep the money around as a fund to buy the next round with


[06-Aug-24 05:59 PM] jvaler#0000
1 - not really no


[06-Aug-24 06:00 PM] jvaler#0000
2 - it seems like evayoo wants to turn WKP internally sourced, in which case it will operate on a player by player basis instead of waves. similar to AGP


[06-Aug-24 06:00 PM] jvaler#0000
thing is i can't remember if i ever sent you a cont for money lmfao


[06-Aug-24 06:01 PM] jvaler#0000
i imagine i did? but that also means i didn't account for the cost of LHP & SSC? which would be weird?


[06-Aug-24 06:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
I thought I paid in half, but I honestly don‚Äôt remember either


[06-Aug-24 06:01 PM] jvaler#0000
at the time we didn't know what half was yet iirc


[06-Aug-24 06:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm not gonna send my trained hitmen after you or anything


[06-Aug-24 06:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can go through my contract history later and see if I did


[06-Aug-24 06:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
But if I did, and you‚Äôre planning on putting money towards ADI shipbuilding, then you can just keep the money and add it to that üôÇ


[06-Aug-24 06:08 PM] sidepipe#0000
I don‚Äôt see a contract for it anywhere in my history, so I must not have sent any money. I guess I‚Äôve been stealing credit on the project the whole time üò¨

@jvaler Evayoo mentioned you were interested in funding the ADI ship project, is that correct?


[06-Aug-24 06:18 PM] jvaler#0000
yup


[06-Aug-24 06:19 PM] jvaler#0000
both to build the bases and also to give WKP recipients full priced ships instead of internally discounted ones, that way ship producer profits can stay consistent

Are you interested in a co-funder?

Don‚Äôt judge me too harshly, but I was actually going to build my own EDC base to help fund it - I didn‚Äôt realize evayoo was moving so quickly

that sounds good to me!


[06-Aug-24 06:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
I might also be interested in buying some of the resulting kits - pretty sure there‚Äôs members in OOG who don‚Äôt have upgrades yet


[06-Aug-24 06:28 PM] sidepipe#0000
I mean, we have our own shipbuilders, but it‚Äôs a convenient excuse to guarantee them a bit of income

once they follow the greeting prompt instructions they get member if they have a base in antares, or associate if they do not.

@jvaler did you have an idea of what the loans for PSK should look like?


[08-Sep-24 09:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
Just wanted to check before I paid out to Spermatozoon, so we can keep it consistent


[08-Sep-24 09:57 PM] jvaler#0000
i suggested 60d to evayoo but i'm thinking that may have been too short. the 10 months spermatozoon sent is a bit cautious though lmfao

10 months was kinda funny tbh

Where's the best place to discuss gateways in ANT? Is it a #gov-discussion  thing? Or just a #member-general ? Does it need a new channel? With this morning's release on the test server, I think we know everything we'd need to plan out the routes we might want.

[10-Sep-24 12:20 PM] jcheung#0000
sorry. means bottom line up front, basically a TLDR at the top of an email instead of being at the bottom
damn, that's expensive.... well. gonna need more KV that's for sure.


[10-Sep-24 01:44 PM] archielvahr#0000
ohhhh that kinda BLUF


[10-Sep-24 01:46 PM] archielvahr#0000
* You need one gateway in each direction, they go up to 25 parsecs. 
* We should decide routes and make a sheet where people can plan production
* Decide on funding (I'm guessing it's gonna be a donation thing probably, unless someone wants to front the cash in exchange for the toll fees)
* I have a tool people can use for checking system ranges.


[10-Sep-24 01:59 PM] flor2081#0000
one in each direction, does that mean you need to build 2 to get a link between 2 planets?


[10-Sep-24 01:59 PM] flor2081#0000
that would mean that one gateway costs like half a billion


[10-Sep-24 01:59 PM] archielvahr#0000
If you only have one gateway, you aren't goin' anywhere


[10-Sep-24 02:00 PM] flor2081#0000
what do the gateways actually do? they just shorten the path and use less fuel?


[10-Sep-24 02:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
I mean maybe you can visit it as like... a tourism thing. But no gateway travel


[10-Sep-24 02:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Think of them as a new link on the map. You FTL travel through them, and hopefully skip a bunch of jumps.

looking forward to how this changes the markets, there will probably be a huge rise in production of SP, TSH and all that stuff


[10-Sep-24 03:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah. One question is.. is someone gonna bankroll one of the ANT gates and take ownership of it for tolls, is there going to be a total community 100% donation gateway... is there gonna be some sort of cooperative organization to own and organize the gateway?


[10-Sep-24 03:29 PM] flor2081#0000
honestly i assumed it would just be the latter, like OOG making a gateway for example


[10-Sep-24 03:41 PM] archielvahr#0000
I figured the general public might not be interested in that. And more people would want to be involved, and maybe share in the toll income. Even if OOG fronted 100% of the cost, folks would not want to pay tolls to OOG


[10-Sep-24 03:56 PM] flor2081#0000
honestly i doubt that, considering it'll cost 1 billion


[10-Sep-24 03:56 PM] flor2081#0000
i dont think people will mind paying taxes


[10-Sep-24 03:56 PM] flor2081#0000
the taxes would have to be huge to ever get a return though..


[10-Sep-24 06:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Parsecs as in physical distance, or distance down jump lines


[10-Sep-24 06:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
I just kinda thought of this while chatting in UFO, but since gateways would be owned by governments, they could basically borrow money from players to build them with two MOTS


[10-Sep-24 06:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
Set up a contribution MOT to get the cash, a future payout at some % interest, and then finance the interest / etc with toll income / taxes

Though I guess you can't set a deadline for a payout MOT, so you'd have to track the deadlines externally

parsecs in physical distance on the in-game map, (or using the coordinates via FIO, which is what I use in the tools). I have confirmed they match the in-game gateway tool

Okay fellow coordinators. After some discussion elsewhere, someone came up with the idea that we could run the gateway like a regional co-op. These were my thoughts on a gateway co-op.

* Anyone in ANT who wants to join the co-op is welcome.
* We track the contributions, and each contributing member has a percentage of the gateway assigned to them. So you're sort of a partial owner of the gateway.
* The co-op maintains a sheet tracking contributed materials, and also "planned materials"- materials intended to be contributed, in an effort to avoid accidentally making too many of a particular gateway material.
*  (less importantly) Tolls, if any, are distributed according to shares
*  (more importantly) All members are incentivized to ensure someone (anyone) in the co-op maintains governorship of the gateway planet.
* Any member agrees to uphold the co-op if they are elected governor. 
* Someone works out prices (not for reimbursement, just for proportional gateway contribution calculations)

I wanted to run it by the coordinators first, but ADI seems like an appropriate home for something like this- if not, it could live elsewhere. What's everyone think?

I'll go ahead with announcing the idea tomorrow then-  last question (maybe for @jvaler ? ) What's the best channel? I don't want to derail anything else, does it need a new channel?


[12-Sep-24 04:25 AM] jvaler#0000
this sounds like a planning thing, so #associate-planning for now? not so sure how far this is gonna go and it doesn't seem concrete enough to warrant a channel yet

i picked a bad time to check in on that discussion too. went a week and some change without keeping up with it because of RL, and... what do i see? MOR selected their gates, some polls. so i pinned the polls and discussed the polls. shouldn't have done that in hindsight

I feel like he's constantly de-railing conversations, but I generally read what he says as good natured. Usually that kind of behavior is some sort of Sealioning behavior but I don't think that's the case here. I don't see it likely that he'll change even if someone has a longer talk with him. But he does seem content to talk even if everyone ignores him.


[10-Oct-24 07:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
I've sort of hinted to him before to chill ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Absolutely no idea what to make of that though


[11-Oct-24 08:55 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Seems like he just feels the need to contribute to literally every conversation and try to sound smart, even if he has literally nothing useful to contribute. Wanting to feel involved and not having the right personal social tools is fine even if it's annoying. He doesn't seem as confrontational as I originally thought though. Likes to argue for sure, but generally 'pretentious opinions stated as facts' are as problematic as he gets. That said: community guidelines are just guidelines, so I do think that if a majority of people think the behavior is toxic to the community as a whole, then it's 100% worth considering a more serious approach. Not acting for fear of overstep at the cost of people feeling uncomfortable in the space is not healthy long term imo

Yeah, unfortunately I agree. Every time he posts it entirely derails the whatever is going on. I was trying to guide the conversation to picking a planet in LS-231, give it a day or two of discussion, so everyone can have their word... but I think it's buried. 

But to echo EvoV's comment there. I feel like everyone but Roh is doing fine with that. So.... how do you make a channel with everyone but one person?

[08-Nov-24 08:02 PM] jcheung#0000
is it alright if i post something in #announcements to gauge interest in starting up something for C production?
```With the recent rampant market manipulation and several people expressing a desire to start C production, I want to gauge interest in a cooperative C production program.

Individually, if you were to do GRN burn using harmonia to produce grain, you can use 2 permits to produce around 200 C per day, purchasing water (cost roughly 10 C worth @750/u), selling GRN (roughly 17 C) [103 per permit]

As a group, we could produce around 1200 C/d with triple burn using harmonia for GRN and HYFs for MAI and HCP with 8 permits (requires at least 3 different people for harmonia and another set of 3 for HYF [can be same people]), purchasing water and NS (~ -274 C), selling excess GRN/HCP/MAI (~ +50 C) [122/permit]
- The cost of purchased goods can be reduced by using another permit for H2O production (full consumption) [still ~ 122/permit]

Further scaling can be done with more permits.

Disclaimer: I will not be contributing a base to this effort, but I will, should nobody else wish to, coordinate this project and assist with shipping*```

-# *shipping will likely  have a small cost associated with it


[08-Nov-24 08:04 PM] jcheung#0000
those of you in AA might notice the concept is basically BURN


[08-Nov-24 08:05 PM] tanda#0000
definitely looks plausible. What's the floor for pricing? How low can the price go before this stops making money


[08-Nov-24 08:07 PM] jcheung#0000
that depends


[08-Nov-24 08:07 PM] jcheung#0000
BURN pays out in C, so you basically have the option to liquidate, or stockpile


[08-Nov-24 08:07 PM] jcheung#0000
if we do instead credit payouts... that would add a level of complexity


[08-Nov-24 08:09 PM] jcheung#0000
also how do we define stop making money


[08-Nov-24 08:09 PM] tanda#0000
the C is more expensive to produce than it's worth on the market


[08-Nov-24 08:12 PM] jcheung#0000
assuming a 9 permit version, H2O and NS asks don't skyrocket, and not including repair costs (will need to figure that part out), at 100/u is roughly the 0 profit line


[08-Nov-24 08:13 PM] tanda#0000
so if C doesn't go below about 500 (highly unlikely) this will benefit literally all involved


[08-Nov-24 08:13 PM] jcheung#0000
to be above 54k/base (again with same caveats as above) the line is 500/u


[08-Nov-24 08:14 PM] jcheung#0000
and again, with the same caveats as before, at 750/u (chosen as a middleground for a longer term average) that's 87k per permit


[08-Nov-24 08:14 PM] jcheung#0000
err wait, need to redo some numbers


[08-Nov-24 08:14 PM] jcheung#0000
forgot to subtract something


[08-Nov-24 08:15 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, edited


[08-Nov-24 08:16 PM] jcheung#0000
repair costs will also be shared, so the HYFs don't eat more of the long term costs than FRMs


[08-Nov-24 08:16 PM] jcheung#0000
not sure how to handle the initial build differences, might simply not be able to


[08-Nov-24 08:18 PM] jcheung#0000
if for whatever reason we get up to 15-20 permits, then we could also start looking at producing NS as well, then the prices that may matter will be N and LST


[08-Nov-24 08:19 PM] jcheung#0000
or even 10 people and just sell the excess


[08-Nov-24 08:19 PM] jcheung#0000
the major downside of this compaired to simple GRN single burn 2 base is that it has a significantly higher shipping load


[08-Nov-24 08:19 PM] tanda#0000
I think this is a great idea. If I were earlier in my empire, I'd be ready to signup (even with my own C base)


[08-Nov-24 08:20 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, Evayoo has been struggling with that load for some time


[08-Nov-24 08:20 PM] jcheung#0000
older players with bases at the right locations may also be able to just swap over too


[08-Nov-24 08:20 PM] jcheung#0000

So on that note though, I would like to officially announce the existence of a sister-group in Benten that has been making some plans for a while. We're still getting discord things set up (we'll just be using the UFO discord plus a custom channel Saganaki set us up with), but a few of us up in Benten who have been inspired by the success of ADI have started up 'BEST', the Benten Economic Support Team, with similar goals of just trying to help new players figure out what the hell to do and how to make plans and expand early on. If any of you are in the Benten area at all and would like to help let us know. You guys are pretty well established at this point and it'll take a while before BEST is more than just a grant + FAQ doc, but I'd love to find ways that these groups can help each other. Each region has it's strengths and sharing educational resources with new players could be helpful ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[14-Nov-24 01:52 PM] realharvey#0000
very cool!


[14-Nov-24 01:55 PM] tanda#0000
Very nice! Let me know how i can help, expanding up into that area is on my 6 month plan


[14-Nov-24 02:02 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
nice! Right now we're just kinda starting how ADI did, with a 500k grant for second base expansions. We also wrote up a long FAQ that we're still improving on because BEN has some weird start options. It's a great region overall, but the starter packages and planets are kinda dumb so a big goal of ours is just to help people around those *immediate* obstacles to success

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[14-Nov-24 02:03 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but the FAQ has some great info for anyone in ANT looking to expand that way, a list of good expansion planets and what makes them good. Many of them compliment Antares well.


[14-Nov-24 02:06 PM] tanda#0000
Got my planets already picked out, lol


[14-Nov-24 02:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

[14-Nov-24 02:12 PM] tanda#0000
I've got my eye on a really nice, uninhabited  CLI planet 2 jumps from the cx and 2 jumps from ls231


[14-Nov-24 02:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Our standard rule of thumb is not to advertise or openly recruit from ADI. Like you've said, I think as a corp we operate differently from ADI and it's not a great match for corps to push too hard in community type channels. It is better just for a bunch of OOG people to show up and help out as Antarens (Antareans?) rather than corp members.  Plus our discord isn't really set up to be useful for people who aren't prospective members.

i've been chatting with australis and the topic of roh came up. given the topic, i checked inside #agc-general and realized the behavior is back to being as bad as it was a few weeks ago.

i'm considering that something more than a warning needs to happen, but i don't want to be unfair to roh. i need y'alls opinions

[30-Nov-24 11:36 AM] jvaler#0000
i think my inaction may have jeopardized the agc project's health. i think i never realized just how detrimental roh's pedantry and tangents were to any possible conversation due to my uninvolvement. i'd mentally skip over any wall of text from roh and not realize it prevented actual discussion. agc being unable to discuss anything means it won't gain interest, and that means the project hurts


[30-Nov-24 11:41 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk it‚Äôs hard


[30-Nov-24 11:42 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Like is he arguing bc he‚Äôs arguing or does he just have shit poor reading comprehension


[30-Nov-24 11:42 AM] tanda#0000
discussion definitely seems to have moved elsewhere, since that channel has gone dead quiet but plans are still being formed


[30-Nov-24 11:43 AM] tanda#0000
Idk, I think it's unlikely that it's a reading comprehension issue, he goes WAY off on a tangent almost every time he posts


[30-Nov-24 11:44 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Fair


[30-Nov-24 11:45 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I get the feeling that he doesn‚Äôt like the direction the devs have gone in terms of gateways


[30-Nov-24 11:46 AM] tanda#0000
There's a large number of people in the same boat, like even lowstrife has definitely said it seems like a fool's errand

If you don‚Äôt like it then leave the convo about it

And we told them to stop the rambling.. and its back to rambling again


[30-Nov-24 11:52 AM] jvaler#0000
do you think they actually saw the message given the lack of response to it?


[30-Nov-24 11:53 AM] jvaler#0000
but if i ask them directly "did you see this warning message pinged to you weeks ago?" it feels like a passive-aggressive dick move


[30-Nov-24 11:53 AM] realharvey#0000
not sure about this one. But I remember one, where roh was told to stop the rambling and answered to it saying basically that they are busy and will give some inputs on weekends and thats it


[30-Nov-24 11:54 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean you have to be kinda blind to not see a ping


[30-Nov-24 11:55 AM] jvaler#0000
ik and that's why i'm worried it was intentionally ignored


[30-Nov-24 11:55 AM] jvaler#0000

[30-Nov-24 11:57 AM] realharvey#0000
This is a discord community. You make the rules. Tbh I dont think roh has a good reputation here anyway. There are probably more people annoyed than just us.


[30-Nov-24 11:57 AM] jvaler#0000

[30-Nov-24 11:58 AM] astra1414#0000
i'd personally rather not see anyone getting kicked


[30-Nov-24 11:58 AM] realharvey#0000
Endorsing bad behaviour isnt the right call aswell.


[30-Nov-24 11:59 AM] astra1414#0000
but at the same time, something has to be done, and quite frankly they way they completely ignored jvaler's warning towards them really sits wrong with me


[30-Nov-24 12:03 PM] jvaler#0000
i started writing something up but realized they haven't messaged too recently. so i'm waiting for it to happen again so i can address it directly


[30-Nov-24 12:04 PM] realharvey#0000
this is the right call

Yeah it feels like part ADHD, part narcissism to me. One of those is innocent and manageable, the other is just toxic. He just seems to love the sound of his own voice. For me, I don't mind the unnecessarily long messages when he has something interesting to share. But it frustrates me when he jumps in to answer questions, sometimes questions directed at other specific individuals, just to basically give a super long winded "idk" as a response.

I think maybe he mostly means well, so this could be a constructive point for him. Instead of just: "plz talk less", make it conditional: "plz don't respond to questions that you can't give a concise factual answer to, it can derail conversation and prevent the asker from getting a real answer at all" ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

if everyone agrees there's a problem, the block button doesn't solve it. cause every new person encounters the problem while we get to ignore it

Is it dramatically different from using a translator app?


[06-Dec-24 07:08 PM] jvaler#0000
kinda, i think... ai speaks *for* you more than a regular translator does


[06-Dec-24 07:09 PM] jvaler#0000
cause what they're basically doing is inputting their message in their native language and having the ai paraphrase it in english


[06-Dec-24 07:10 PM] tanda#0000
I certainly wouldn't be comfortable with the AI speaking for me like that, but if he says he can read it, then I hope he does read what it's saying


[06-Dec-24 07:10 PM] jvaler#0000
hmm that's true


[06-Dec-24 07:11 PM] tanda#0000
The ai he's using doesn't sound natural at all though, so I'm curious what kind of standard it's setting


[06-Dec-24 07:11 PM] tanda#0000
I don't see much wrong with it on an individual case basis, I just wouldn't want it to become widespread


[06-Dec-24 07:12 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm leaning towards making an exception due to it being used for translation and not just trying to improve their writing needlessly

[07-Dec-24 02:35 AM] realharvey#0000
Feed your sourcebooks to the AI


[11-Dec-24 09:57 AM] evany.#0000
even then a paper or two doesn't really get an LLM to where it needs to be 

as for roh- have already put too much thought into this kid warning or a punt. he does occasionally offer good advice i've seen but it seems to be usually by accident, if we're still talking about him after all this time i'd probably just punt the kid and stop wasting time on him

for ai- i mean you can't, people nowadays use it for plenty of means and with it entering the disability territory, its one thing if we were creative and all the Ai art but if we're talking about translation or like a speech impediment we can't really know. 

my two cents

yeah my intent is not to shit talk, but if the purpose of this channel is to monitor and maintain a healthy community then it is important to at least stay informed on this kind of toxicity. It's not meant to be mean, but even voicing frustrations can be an important step to checking in on people

like, if I say "this person really pissed me off" and half of you are like "omg thank you, me too!", then I think a problem has been discovered worth addressing. I do agree it's important that it not turn into venting just to vent or be mean though


[28-Jan-25 06:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think if we were saying stuff like ‚Äúomg did you see so and so, can you believe how stupid they are for making that kind of base‚Äù etc it would be different, but it is a known ‚Äúrabble rouser‚Äù

your block likely went into effect today, as they replied to you earlier

i don't think so, i realized the block 1 minute after sending that


[11-Feb-25 06:38 PM] jvaler#0000
and given i didn't ping i don't think they would have happened to be there to instantly block me


[11-Feb-25 06:38 PM] jvaler#0000
but i suppose it's technically possible


[11-Feb-25 06:40 PM] tanda#0000
They did respond to you by name in that channel at least

fyi: `Batman_Project | ASS` already received a grant from ADI, and is now requesting a grant from IDA. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think we considered situations where a player would try to collect every grant out there (ADI, IDA, BEST, etc)


[01-Apr-25 03:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't think it's a bad thing


[01-Apr-25 06:11 AM] jvaler#0000

[01-Apr-25 06:11 AM] jvaler#0000

[01-Apr-25 06:49 AM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe we should share our grant lists between all the groups. I also don‚Äôt think doubling up on grants is a bad thing, but that way each group can make an informed decision about it

@cptcoleslaw is already here to be able to see the sheet link in #agp-information , but i don't know anybody from IDA


[01-Apr-25 07:29 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I can also share out BEST tracking sheet (don't judge, it's the laziest spreadsheet üòÜ ), but honestly I personally don't care too much. I'll pass the idea along to other BEST people, and it can't hurt to monitor it just for the obvious red flags (collecting all grants before building), but I'm not too worried


[01-Apr-25 07:29 AM] realharvey#0000
I do believe there should be some time between grants if they take multiple


[01-Apr-25 07:30 AM] realharvey#0000
its also not a wise choice to spread yourself out to multiple regions when you have just a few ships

{Reactions}

[01-Apr-25 07:30 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
BEST is about to bump up our grant to match the 1 mil here and in MOR though, so maybe we should pay more attention


[01-Apr-25 07:31 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
overall though, I've never really had many issues operating just on good faith in this game, so I don't wanna add work for myself until I'm proven wrong


[01-Apr-25 07:31 AM] razenpok#0000
Wait, MOR has a grant program?


[01-Apr-25 07:31 AM] realharvey#0000
I do believe also that people claim making a base in one region but not actually doing it when they are looking at getting multiple grants


[01-Apr-25 07:32 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
oh maybe not üòÖ maybe it's IDA I'm thinking of, that's insotor?

I think just a simple list would be more than enough tracking to keep an eye on it. just: Name, Date, Region. drop an entry whenever a grant is given

hmm... I think personally, if someone asked for BEST grant and I knew they got a grant/loan from you or IDA, I'd probably wait for them to build with one grant before getting ours. Unless they're a returning players that knows what they're doing, taking grants from 3 different regions and trying to build 3 espansions at once just... doens't seem smart for most new people

yeah, at 40k, I'm interested to see what that was about


[15-Apr-25 08:17 PM] tanda#0000
even passed up 1mil to get that 40k


[15-Apr-25 09:15 PM] jcheung#0000
tripping over dollars to pick up pennies


[16-Apr-25 09:45 AM] evany.#0000
shiny pennies though.


[16-Apr-25 01:12 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
wait they took out a 45k loan while offering 300k loans?...


[16-Apr-25 01:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it honestly doesn't seem like a scam to me, just someone who saw the 'loan' type of contract and considered it an opportunity without running the numbers. but that's still... interesting


[16-Apr-25 01:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
did anyone take them up on their offer? if not I will...

[16-Apr-25 01:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
(joking, hopefully they've been convinced to invest in their own expansion instead)

i mean, you'll still autopay unless you run out of money

I just saw Akyan paid one, so wanted to give him the magic role, but thought I should check first just in case


[18-Apr-25 12:59 PM] jvaler#0000
nope that's why staff was created seperate of contributor role

[18-Apr-25 12:59 PM] jvaler#0000
contributor still exists


[18-Apr-25 01:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
Wait, I don‚Äôt see a contributor role. Maybe I‚Äôm confused, it‚Äôs been a bit - is the coordinator role the right one for contributors?


[18-Apr-25 01:06 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or I might just not have permission to hand that out


[18-Apr-25 02:14 PM] jvaler#0000

i don't see an option to hand out contributor either.

@jvaler did you mean coordinator?

just a heads up that if a dominikb1199 comes asking for a grant I'd be sure to see plans first. They're one day into the game and already on strike 3 of mildly sketchy interactions with BEST

[21-Apr-25 12:05 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
- posted on the same day they started playing that they need some fuel and a loan (how do you run out of starting fuel on day 1...
- said that they'd read about the BEST grant but never actually followed up or asked for anything
- posted 700k CIS worth of sell ads on Katoa LM then asked for payment before delivery

heard back from them: our opinion so far is that they just don't really know what they're doing üòÖ they've been more active in the german chat, which is good. And their responses have been friendly. So I think that there's a language barrier and they don't really understand the game well. Probably a risky investment if you're giving out loans. But not scummy ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø üëç


[23-Apr-25 03:22 PM] razenpok#0000
@jvaler is it possible to set up sapphire to delete messages older than n days? For example, older than 7 days in #shipping

Can make it more interactive


[26-Apr-25 08:39 AM] jcheung#0000
Could break it into smaller chunks, like...

"Please set your name to xyz, then enter *keywords* for next step"


[26-Apr-25 08:39 AM] jcheung#0000
A lot of people just skipnto the bottom

You can use markdown in discord so `# Instructions` will render as:
# Instructions: 
blah blah blah


[26-Apr-25 10:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
People can't read paragraphs, but if there's a title that conveys "step 1, step 2" or "this is a thing _you_ are responsible to do" that might help


[26-Apr-25 10:01 AM] archielvahr#0000
Otherwise they think it's a list of generic rules like a lot of discords have, and I'm not surprised they don't read it.

sapphire doesn't seem to have that feature, i'd have to add a new bot

Probably not worth it then?


[26-Apr-25 11:47 AM] jvaler#0000

[26-Apr-25 11:47 AM] jvaler#0000
it'd only be used in a single channel

it's not a feature in basic discord?

[27-Apr-25 01:42 AM] laaxus#0000
For your information, I leased a base to lguth


[27-Apr-25 01:43 AM] laaxus#0000

[27-Apr-25 01:43 AM] laaxus#0000
I believe a stable income from a leased base is great for New players


[27-Apr-25 01:44 AM] jvaler#0000
wasn't that after the loan though? they were asking about getting 40k while they were still in the airlock even


[27-Apr-25 01:44 AM] laaxus#0000
And weekly human interaction might increase long term player retention

true 

[27-Apr-25 01:44 AM] laaxus#0000
It's also another way to give money away

I did it yesterday


[27-Apr-25 01:45 AM] laaxus#0000
I thought he might be struggling financially, so I had to find another way than the grant to give him money


[27-Apr-25 01:45 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, Antares need the hal anyway


[27-Apr-25 01:46 AM] jvaler#0000
yeah their market skills are... questionable


[27-Apr-25 01:46 AM] jvaler#0000

The salary I give is either 350k or 350k - (base cost / 13 weeks), if they chose the second option, the base is theirs After 90 days


[27-Apr-25 01:48 AM] laaxus#0000
I'll make that offer public once I'm done reconfiguring my bases


[27-Apr-25 01:49 AM] jvaler#0000
assuming you mean 50k/d


[27-Apr-25 01:50 AM] laaxus#0000
In my head, New players joining the ADI will take the grant (so they Can Do their own stuff) + a leased base ( so that they get a stable income, which means less pressure)


[27-Apr-25 01:50 AM] laaxus#0000
I pay weekly but yeah, base salary would be 50k/d


[27-Apr-25 01:50 AM] jvaler#0000

being able to do your own thing is critical


[27-Apr-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah I had a leased base with Rise, it helped me tremendously


[27-Apr-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000
I might have been bankrupted at some point without that stable income


[27-Apr-25 01:52 AM] laaxus#0000
A small diff√©rence beside the pay, will be that I take Care of the consummables


[27-Apr-25 01:53 AM] laaxus#0000
They'll have no shipping to do, just accept conts and send production back


[27-Apr-25 01:54 AM] jvaler#0000
did consumable packages influence that decision?


[27-Apr-25 01:55 AM] laaxus#0000
Not really, I give them 45d of consummables at the start


[27-Apr-25 11:01 AM] jcheung#0000
Sure you can.
