[10-Sep-24 06:15 PM] jcheung#0000
I should probably get started on my ASMs... then again i could be lazy since engi count is low


[10-Sep-24 06:49 PM] tanda#0000
same boat sir


[10-Sep-24 06:49 PM] tanda#0000
so many interesting things going on right now. I just had two new bases added to my prospects this week


[10-Sep-24 11:46 PM] evany.#0000
You should drop engi now otherwise someone else might end up with them


[10-Sep-24 11:46 PM] evany.#0000
Just build a few at a time pre-POPR


[11-Sep-24 08:40 AM] avalock#0000
1,000 TIO landed at ANT, whoever needs can take :3


[11-Sep-24 11:50 AM] igfloz#0000
tempting, I don't don't want to jam up my storage with all that smelted TI tho. 4.5t /m^3 is no joke ! - I might send for 500. Is anyone else pinned for doing TI for this project ?


[11-Sep-24 11:51 AM] avalock#0000
Sounds good, 500 is fine with me :3


[11-Sep-24 11:51 AM] avalock#0000
I'm unsure, I think there was another person doing SME


[11-Sep-24 11:51 AM] avalock#0000
#psk-information will prolly need to be filled out at somepoint


[11-Sep-24 11:52 AM] igfloz#0000
aah, @nyanism is also listed in the original PSK thread for SME


[11-Sep-24 11:54 AM] igfloz#0000
hmm, yeah @evany. get yer butt in gear and run this thing üòÑ


[11-Sep-24 11:54 AM] avalock#0000
lolol


[11-Sep-24 11:54 AM] avalock#0000
woof


[11-Sep-24 11:56 AM] igfloz#0000
...he's so gonna knock me back for that lol


[11-Sep-24 12:07 PM] jcheung#0000
Igfloz, how many SME do you have?


[11-Sep-24 12:08 PM] igfloz#0000
Currently running 20 - but I am also running other burns, not just TIO


[11-Sep-24 12:11 PM] igfloz#0000
...so "technically" I will probably over produce for a little while


[11-Sep-24 01:07 PM] igfloz#0000
@avalock do you have any O at Vulcan ?


[11-Sep-24 01:07 PM] avalock#0000
i don‚Äôt sorry


[11-Sep-24 01:08 PM] igfloz#0000
no worries


[11-Sep-24 01:08 PM] avalock#0000
i can start bringing some O now


[11-Sep-24 01:08 PM] igfloz#0000
ummm, I can't remember if that was on you ? Never mind, no listing for O provisions


[11-Sep-24 01:11 PM] avalock#0000
ohhhh


[11-Sep-24 01:16 PM] igfloz#0000
Actually, never mind about O - I was looking at the example SME prunplanner. There is so little "expected" requirements I should just get it off the cx


[11-Sep-24 01:18 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm over burning at the moment. If / when LIO & SIO turn up (or was Si a by product ?) my production values will drop to a more reasonable figure


[11-Sep-24 01:31 PM] jcheung#0000
SIO is the byproduct that you need to make SI


[11-Sep-24 02:02 PM] igfloz#0000
I feel that you have told me this before, but thanks for the reminder üôÇ


[11-Sep-24 02:02 PM] jcheung#0000
Don't worry too much about SI right now though


[11-Sep-24 02:03 PM] jcheung#0000
Or maybe I'll just drop you some SIO from my base on deimos


[11-Sep-24 02:03 PM] jcheung#0000
We have some time before we're in full swing


[11-Sep-24 02:04 PM] igfloz#0000
well, I'm ready to start seeding burn ingredients for the higher tier stuff. err maybe feed me and let me burn for a couple days ?


[11-Sep-24 02:06 PM] jcheung#0000
Sure. I'll probably try to arrange for my base to drop at least the CM and STO later this week, I'll bring the SIO then


[11-Sep-24 02:10 PM] igfloz#0000
FYI, this is my SME base with recipe list

[11-Sep-24 02:11 PM] igfloz#0000
...and I am currently waiting for expert #5


[11-Sep-24 02:19 PM] jcheung#0000
We'll be waiting a while for that tbh


[11-Sep-24 02:20 PM] jcheung#0000
I'll probably be one of your primary consumers of stuff you make


[11-Sep-24 02:20 PM] jcheung#0000
Mostly TIO


[11-Sep-24 02:20 PM] igfloz#0000
so, did I start too early ?? or is it good that I've started ? lol


[11-Sep-24 02:20 PM] nyanism#0000
sorry i was rather occupied on other front, didnt really keep up with prun this month apart from routine resupply


[11-Sep-24 02:21 PM] jcheung#0000
It's probably good. You can crunch some stuff for yourself if we get to a good stock


[11-Sep-24 02:22 PM] igfloz#0000
I figured it's gotta start somewhere, and seeding the project has to start with Ore provisioning


[11-Sep-24 02:25 PM] jcheung#0000
What i think i might do, since we should have a pricelist if not now then soon, is probably just let you know what's low in store and then give you a list of stuff to add to your queue as a one-off alongside your recurring orders


[11-Sep-24 02:26 PM] igfloz#0000
it could work - err, as long as I don't have to transport ummm 20 FEO or something, lol


[11-Sep-24 02:26 PM] jcheung#0000
Guess what


[11-Sep-24 02:26 PM] jcheung#0000
We're on vulcan. The place is made of FEO


[11-Sep-24 02:26 PM] igfloz#0000
I know, I was just making an example üôÇ


[11-Sep-24 02:27 PM] jcheung#0000
That said I'll be displacing some of the SMEs in my plan for extra STO to hold random bits and bobs


[11-Sep-24 02:27 PM] jcheung#0000
So I should theoretically have said FEO


[11-Sep-24 02:28 PM] jcheung#0000
(The extra SMEs will be assigned to... either you or nyan i suppose, which means you might get to add FE refining to your list)


[11-Sep-24 02:31 PM] igfloz#0000
ok, so you are going to be the warehouse of the operation ?


[11-Sep-24 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
And evayoo


[11-Sep-24 02:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Won't be able to hold *everything* but hopefully will be able to buffer stuff


[11-Sep-24 02:35 PM] igfloz#0000
A suggestion - Could either of you start populating #psk-information  ? I mean all the info is in the older PSK thread, but a handy resource to refer to would be easier  ?


[11-Sep-24 02:36 PM] jcheung#0000
We might still be working on some aspects üòÖ 
But yes


[11-Sep-24 02:37 PM] jcheung#0000
I even moved my HQ up to MOR for the metallurgy boost ^_^


[11-Sep-24 03:42 PM] igfloz#0000
500 TIO cont sent @avalock


[12-Sep-24 11:38 AM] igfloz#0000
@avalock  any chance you can send that TIO ? I presume you might have tried but I ran out of space. Should be room now üôÇ


[12-Sep-24 11:38 AM] avalock#0000
its on its way, I didn't realize you're sending it to vulcan lmao


[12-Sep-24 11:39 AM] igfloz#0000
Oh I thought you had 1K total at Vulcan lol


[12-Sep-24 11:39 AM] avalock#0000
Nah, I was sending to ANT, but I can keep a reminder to set it to vulcan

@sidepipe @jvaler Starting to plan dropping the ASM base on Vulcan in the next week or so. I'm sending you both contracts for half of 4mil for construction and initial supply. 2mil each paying weekly across 10 weeks


[15-Sep-24 01:13 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000

[15-Sep-24 01:15 AM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000

[16-Sep-24 08:59 PM] jcheung#0000
i'll probably drop one or two of my ASMs this POPR depending on how materials shake out btw


[16-Sep-24 08:59 PM] jcheung#0000
just in case that affects your planning


[16-Sep-24 09:00 PM] tanda#0000
not particularly? I just want this down and waiting on POP, if it takes a while to fill, that's pretty much what we expected

[17-Sep-24 10:03 PM] jcheung#0000
for buffering for the whole project üòÖ at least the vulcan portion


[17-Sep-24 10:07 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I feel that. I have 8 on Proxion and I've filled it before... I hold a lot of backup stockpiles for one of our projects there and is a lot easier to just have the STO there than fly stuff to and from CX


[17-Sep-24 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
honestly at that point, wouldn't it be better long term to just amp the absolute crap out of the warehouses?


[17-Sep-24 10:08 PM] tanda#0000
or is that super too long term


[17-Sep-24 10:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Warehouses scale in cost a lot and only add 500 t/m every 2 levels. A STO gives 10x that. Proxion has one of the biggest WH in Benten and it would cost millions to upgrade it again


[17-Sep-24 10:09 PM] jcheung#0000
vulcan WAR is already at 3k, which is pretty healthy


[17-Sep-24 10:09 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Your welcome for that btw üòù


[17-Sep-24 10:10 PM] jcheung#0000
in any case, i can always swap out my STO for other stuff later if i end up not needing it

I remember seeing the original list, but it's lost to me now.
I haven't seen any requests or offers for SIO or LIO - but I'm not really sure how the process works, would some of you ASM people produce SIO or LIO as a bi-product ?


[05-Oct-24 07:16 PM] tanda#0000
the ASM processes don't produce byproducts, the only ones that do that should be the AMLs, which do produce SIO as a byproduct of the ZR and BE processes

i'm working on making some. have 15 units at vulcan if you want to get started.... i just... don't know what the proper price is.


[05-Oct-24 08:50 PM] jcheung#0000
....granted "some" won't hardly be enough for the whole project


[05-Oct-24 08:51 PM] tanda#0000
I just grabbed 40 so I'm good for a minute, but looks like someone else is buying off the market as well


[05-Oct-24 08:51 PM] jcheung#0000
soon we'll just be bartering goods


[05-Oct-24 08:52 PM] jcheung#0000
i bought some like 20 days ago


[05-Oct-24 08:52 PM] jcheung#0000
it's actually the 15 i have üòÇ


[05-Oct-24 08:52 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm looking at the 200 units bought 5 days ago


[05-Oct-24 08:53 PM] jcheung#0000
wish i knew who sold that


[07-Oct-24 03:53 AM] jvaler#0000
what's funding looking like so far? anybody else need money from me?

If you haven‚Äôt built your base yet you probably should since it will take some time to get the high level pops


[08-Oct-24 09:14 AM] jvaler#0000
i wanna get this money out of my hands so i know how much i can use for other things


[08-Oct-24 09:15 AM] jvaler#0000
if anyone here still needs to get a base down please go ahead and get the 0 interest loan from me

i  have 8 AMLs bc why not


[10-Oct-24 02:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
with 5 experts I can make 20 Be 10 Zr and some W per day


[10-Oct-24 02:25 PM] jcheung#0000
once here, you can drop the ratio to 2 ZR / 5 BE

[12-Oct-24 02:54 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm kinda leaning towards setting up TIO to help @avalock but if there is another ??


[12-Oct-24 03:20 PM] jcheung#0000
technically we consume... in no particular order, TIO, BER, ZIR, FEO, LIO, HAL, BTS, O


[12-Oct-24 03:20 PM] jcheung#0000
hypothetically we could even consume AUO and CUO but that's not in the plans right now


[12-Oct-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
but for what we have scheduled...


[12-Oct-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
ava's TIO/O, one base should be enough to keep up....


[12-Oct-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
and then i think the other was LIO or BER


[12-Oct-24 03:21 PM] jcheung#0000
i can't remember which


[12-Oct-24 04:00 PM] igfloz#0000
hrm, LIO could be a possibility


[12-Oct-24 04:03 PM] igfloz#0000
urgh, the CX is garbage tho


[12-Oct-24 04:13 PM] igfloz#0000
well... I suppose that's to be expected for a ship building commodity, not a lot of market desire, lol


[12-Oct-24 04:13 PM] tanda#0000
and all the MM people already use their own sources


[12-Oct-24 04:13 PM] igfloz#0000
yeah, I can't see me using LIO myself anytime soon üôÇ

[12-Oct-24 06:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The CX markets used to be pretty good for those things.... Until like a good number of ship-building operations propped themselves up...


[13-Oct-24 09:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
I can supply LIO for this project. Happy to offer an internal price, just name a price and quantity.

[14-Oct-24 08:23 PM] riseoffilth#0000
sure, what chu need


[14-Oct-24 08:25 PM] jcheung#0000
a few LFL, MSL, WCB. have inputs other than MFK


[14-Oct-24 08:25 PM] jcheung#0000
slow is fine too, just looking to clear some space


[14-Oct-24 08:36 PM] jcheung#0000
sent you conts for 4x WCB and 4x MSL, and conts to buy back completed for MFK price, unless you need more.
also oops forgot to edit the preamble


[14-Oct-24 08:52 PM] riseoffilth#0000
you sure you cant make more contracts


[14-Oct-24 08:53 PM] riseoffilth#0000
maybe 1 FET per contract


[14-Oct-24 08:54 PM] jcheung#0000
i dunno what your storage looks like üòõ i can consolidate them if you want


[14-Oct-24 08:59 PM] riseoffilth#0000

interesting ü§î .... I only mention ENG and RCT as there are zero offers on the cx


[30-Oct-24 02:06 PM] igfloz#0000
...looking at the possiblility of building, rather than ordering - although it's probably (possibly?) cheaper to order ??


[30-Oct-24 02:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yes I could make them cheaper than what is listed on the CX


[30-Oct-24 02:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
also I would look into a QCR and a FSE instead of a ENG and RCT


[30-Oct-24 02:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
they're better so most people don't build ENG and RCT as far as I am aware


[30-Oct-24 02:39 PM] igfloz#0000
oh - I didn't realise, I was just copying from my upgraded starter ship (to WCB) blueprint


[30-Oct-24 02:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah and a lot of people have used LHP as well bc its cheaper


[30-Oct-24 02:40 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[31-Oct-24 02:55 AM] evov#0000
Ship building just has too many parts that go into it, that don't really go into anything else. So it heavily favours vertical integration imo.


[31-Oct-24 02:56 AM] evov#0000
There's also not exactly an over abundance of planets capable of supporting asm's.

hey friends so, KAWA lost it's LHP/SSC supplier. I'm trying to get another source, but if I can't then my supply is limited. *It's a bit stockpile*, so it will last a while, not an immediate problem, but if you're still counting on me for those parts then let me know and I'll sort it out on my end asap. Just wasn't sure if you were still counting on that, it's been a while since I checked in

{Reactions}
üëç 

[07-Nov-24 06:59 PM] jcheung#0000
Just out of curiousity what are you looking at for SSC / LHP quantity on your end?


[07-Nov-24 07:03 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Only 164 LHP and 400 SSC sitting on at ANT at the moment, more I could collect and send over, especially SSC. But we're burning through LHP fast in our own shipbuilding now so I could only send over another 100 or so


[07-Nov-24 07:06 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
So I can supply it for a while until I'm able to find another producer, or if I can't find anyone I'll subsidize it for you guys to find a producer


[07-Nov-24 07:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Sorry, i wasn't clear. I meant what would your projected consumption be


[07-Nov-24 07:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
oh! I was just referring to us supplying the LHP/SSC for this project like I originally offered. We make enough for our own use, we're not in need of external supply for KAWA, just not producing the excess to supply this project long term anymore.


[07-Nov-24 07:16 PM] jcheung#0000
Ahh. Gotcha.


[07-Nov-24 07:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
KAWA also just has issues with external suppliers right now, our low internal pricing makes it nice when we can sell excess externally, but not ideal to buy from outside sources ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

{Reactions}
üëç 

[07-Nov-24 07:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
we'll be adjusting our pricing eventually though, so maybe some day it'll be easier to supply for us. We'd love to throw some money and supplies out to help others build when we have demand


[07-Nov-24 07:46 PM] tanda#0000
I would volunteer to help with production of LHP, but I can't internally source the AL necessary with the current TI smelting and personal requirements.
I can be more helpful with the SSC, I have a whole base of WEL, and could easily go as high as 38/day production as needed for the project


[07-Nov-24 09:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If needed I can drop my own base on Deimos to make 20 something LHP per day, that's probably plenty. I'd rather not, but it's a pretty easy base at least


[07-Nov-24 09:41 PM] jcheung#0000
nah, if it comes to it i can drop one


[07-Nov-24 09:41 PM] jcheung#0000
...i'll just have to raid someone's wallet probably


[07-Nov-24 09:45 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I have one of those, and if I don't have to build a base you can raid it, lol. Let me check with KAWA first though, cause if someone in KAWA can make it then it'll be cheaper for the project and keep the final kit cost lower

Nice numbers üòº


[09-Nov-24 11:59 AM] tanda#0000
the burn on my base for making WAL for CTF is a bit less than 2 per day


[09-Nov-24 12:00 PM] tanda#0000
only on 4th expert though, that will probably go up to 2


[09-Nov-24 12:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Cool cool üòé


[09-Nov-24 12:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So I should be fine as long as I can keep ZIR, BER and BTS

I'm looking to drop 1k units of SI metal; 200 units of BE element, and 100 unit of ZR elements on PSK, since you peeps asked on the info channel, and I leik ya....

Simple offer with high/low bids. I'll low-ball pretty much everything, I just need margin ranges to make the transaction simple.


[10-Nov-24 11:25 AM] evany.#0000
@tanda @.urpalhal can we sort out enough for LFE ? 
i just need maybe 1-2 of these a day

to make the CBL, how much HCC do you need per day? I have one FS I could dedicate to this on Deimos


[10-Nov-24 11:27 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Do we need more than this?

if we produce two LFE a day thats 24 BE a day (into CBL)


[10-Nov-24 11:37 AM] evany.#0000
we would need 120 HCC a day into CBL


[10-Nov-24 11:38 AM] evany.#0000
i am happy to provide the PG for the HCC if you want tanda


[10-Nov-24 11:40 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I currently make 24 BE a day


[10-Nov-24 11:41 AM] tanda#0000
hm, I'll have to expand my FS I think. even just producing straight HCC that's only 53 a day


[10-Nov-24 11:43 AM] evany.#0000
thats metal i think right


[10-Nov-24 11:43 AM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'll look at knocking out a couple smelters on Deimos for 2 more FS

yeah if you guys think we can do cheaper / better -- im all ears.


[10-Nov-24 12:21 PM] evany.#0000
to be transparent with the pricing - i looked at existing costs for targeted archived wkp project and tried to hit that


[10-Nov-24 12:21 PM] evany.#0000
and rather than re-engineer every item in a ship of which t heres like 100's of unique items


[10-Nov-24 12:22 PM] evany.#0000
all i did was go after the most expensive items/highest percentage of the cost and try to get those lower


[10-Nov-24 12:22 PM] evany.#0000
so lower grade items like C that there wasn't much of- was irrelevant and didn't get attention


[10-Nov-24 12:22 PM] tanda#0000
pulling from the market, COGM for CTF is only 14k. So that could definitely be calculated lower internally


[10-Nov-24 12:22 PM] evany.#0000
that was ideal for me in both ways 
a.) less paperwork
and b.) more room for profit for intermediate components


[10-Nov-24 12:23 PM] evany.#0000
that would be great and could bring down LFE price rather significantly as theres 3 of them in it


[10-Nov-24 12:23 PM] evany.#0000
would bring it down like ~15k


[10-Nov-24 12:23 PM] tanda#0000
If we could get W price down below current market average that price could drop substantially as well


[10-Nov-24 12:24 PM] evany.#0000
if we dro pto 12k that would bring total cost to produce down nearly 30k


[10-Nov-24 12:24 PM] evany.#0000
yeah


[10-Nov-24 12:24 PM] evany.#0000
hal is our internal W guy at least currently

[10-Nov-24 12:25 PM] evany.#0000
wheres your bottleneck there ?


[10-Nov-24 12:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Glad I made extra AMLs


[10-Nov-24 12:26 PM] evany.#0000
BTS ?


[10-Nov-24 12:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Nope I got tha


[10-Nov-24 12:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Just don‚Äôt have enough AMLs to do more than 26;10;5 BE;ZR;W


[10-Nov-24 12:27 PM] tanda#0000
70% of manufacturing cost on these items is just workforce, right?


[10-Nov-24 12:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
A good chunk is


[10-Nov-24 12:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But also price for AFABs for repair costs

Heh i did to get it done quick


[10-Nov-24 12:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000

Since he‚Äôs on bober


[10-Nov-24 12:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
20k/u rather than the 30 something k/ unit


[10-Nov-24 03:13 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
I actually used SidePipe/Jvaler funding to set up PP4's and mats for A-fab prod to make and maintain the AML base, so I'm good for TSH

link_cool 

[10-Nov-24 06:55 PM] jcheung#0000
Since we habe two AML bases that should be enough to cover our overall needs


[11-Nov-24 02:16 PM] igfloz#0000
So... with a gun to my head I have agreed to set up ECA & ELP on Phobos (I'm joking, no heads were involved) - to produce the required CBL & LFE

I'm going to need LI, HCC, PG & BE to produce the CBL ( any LI smelters out there ?)

@.urpalhal I believe you are handling CTF ? I'll need that also.

Dunno how I'm gonna buy all this off you, I'm penniless, ROFL.

@evany. @jcheung I wonder if you can do all the dealing and I can do the producing ?


[11-Nov-24 02:17 PM] jcheung#0000
I can't for sure speak for evayoo but what can likely happen is evayoo prepurchases the output materials from you, then you use those funds to acquire inputs


[11-Nov-24 02:17 PM] jcheung#0000
Or the people supplying the inputs take deferred payment


[11-Nov-24 02:18 PM] tanda#0000
I've got CTF at this point on ANT. I've been using 30 day payment contracts for any internal usage, so there's plenty of leeway


[11-Nov-24 02:18 PM] igfloz#0000
I can try and take the gun off evayoo and point it back to him.... thats an idea üòÑ


[11-Nov-24 02:19 PM] tanda#0000
HCC will begin production in about 2 days on Deimos, so I'll need like 5 to actually produce enough for a buffer


[11-Nov-24 02:20 PM] jcheung#0000
I'm likely to start a new TI/LIO/LI base soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è with a jvaler¬©Ô∏è loan as well, which should give you some breathing room as far as smelting operations go


[11-Nov-24 02:20 PM] igfloz#0000
sweet. I did buy a small amount of LI off the CX to spin up, but I feel that price is too high, hence looking for LI producers


[11-Nov-24 02:20 PM] jcheung#0000
Can also see if rise has some LI


[11-Nov-24 02:20 PM] jcheung#0000
He was starting up LI production


[11-Nov-24 02:20 PM] jcheung#0000

nice, because if you guys planned for two bases to be running it, mine's not enough


[11-Nov-24 05:29 PM] jcheung#0000
I'll have to double check CTF but if tanda can do 15 i can probably also


[11-Nov-24 05:30 PM] jcheung#0000
You and i were supposed to have about half each


[12-Nov-24 11:43 AM] evany.#0000
@tanda @jcheung your both trying to give me 500 FET when i already have 2200 FET currently and even with 35k storage its too heavy so i can't accept either of your conts right now
two concerns
1.) whats our AST/FET balance? should be about 45:55 (one cycle costs 130 FET, 100 AST) but i only have 600 AST (900) so it seems like our balance is more like 30:70
2.) can you still store it or is it hindering? how much are you producing per day
2b) maybe i can drop another skf. ill look into that


[12-Nov-24 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
I can hold it


[12-Nov-24 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
It's mostly because of how long it took to get this one online


[12-Nov-24 11:45 AM] jcheung#0000
I'm still slightly underproducing, i think


[12-Nov-24 11:46 AM] tanda#0000
If we're that bad, FET needs to stop production. I am running the balance shown here https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1192951755462410271/1276695793528475669


[12-Nov-24 11:46 AM] evany.#0000
okay sure!


[12-Nov-24 11:46 AM] jcheung#0000
I can review my ratios later, mine i know are a little off because of CTF


[12-Nov-24 11:46 AM] evany.#0000
ah yeah CTF is in the mix too


[12-Nov-24 11:46 AM] jcheung#0000
(Mine are off because CTF is manual start for me right now)


[12-Nov-24 11:46 AM] evany.#0000
i think fet is fine- just that the ratios are off, if they were balanced better its probably OK


[12-Nov-24 11:46 AM] jcheung#0000
I'm still underproducing slightly right now-not enough engi


[12-Nov-24 11:47 AM] evany.#0000
i still have zero experts, too


[12-Nov-24 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
So your SKF being online should put us at a slight negative


[12-Nov-24 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
In theory


[12-Nov-24 11:47 AM] evany.#0000
not great but, good in this situation!

[12-Nov-24 03:48 PM] jcheung#0000
alright. so my AST:FET queue is 2:3 which is 106 : 160.... hmmm. must have fat fingered something lol. will try to tune it a little better later


[12-Nov-24 03:51 PM] jcheung#0000
in the meantime i'll try to run off a bit more AST


[12-Nov-24 03:58 PM] jcheung#0000
tuned it a little, now i'll probably be slightly underproducing FET üôÑ


[12-Nov-24 03:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs ok


[12-Nov-24 03:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I make some FET


[12-Nov-24 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
i'll be making extra materials too


[12-Nov-24 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm just going to have to manually run off a batch of stuff every so often üòÇ

which is probably fine


[12-Nov-24 06:51 PM] rxbbxss#0000
Hey, not got anything set up related to this at the moment but considering getting into space ship part manufacturing. Is this the kind of project that smaller production could also help out on or is it mainly being organised at a per-base level?

Full disclaimer I've not read too much into this project yet, just saw spaceships :)


[12-Nov-24 07:16 PM] tanda#0000
so how much AST are we short? because I'll plop that in for a big bulk run just to get us caught up again


[12-Nov-24 07:24 PM] tanda#0000
oh yeah, this is my bad I think

@razesdark at th e least li right now


[13-Nov-24 03:50 PM] evany.#0000
probably sio -> si as well


[13-Nov-24 03:57 PM] razesdark#0000
Hmm. Ok.
I don't smelt any of that atm.


[13-Nov-24 03:59 PM] razesdark#0000
I probably got some space on deimos if its just the small amounts listed in the images above


[13-Nov-24 04:04 PM] razesdark#0000
That being said. I have about 600 TI a week that I could supply, if that opens up capacity with an existing smelter in the project


[13-Nov-24 04:11 PM] igfloz#0000
TI ? or TIO ? - I am currently providing TIO >> smelting to TI and I can't really keep up with TI demand for others.... If you are already producing TI, That might help


[13-Nov-24 04:12 PM] razesdark#0000
Yep, already smelting TI, everything is set up and is running already.


[13-Nov-24 04:13 PM] igfloz#0000
@jcheung  üëÜ


[13-Nov-24 04:32 PM] tanda#0000
I can flex off TI then and run SI or LI


[13-Nov-24 04:36 PM] igfloz#0000
....sounds like a plan forming üôÇ


[13-Nov-24 04:37 PM] igfloz#0000
@razesdark where are you smelting TI ? As I said earlier, I am bringing TIO into PSK project. Where do you need it ?


[13-Nov-24 04:40 PM] razesdark#0000
Atm I'm good on TIO. Im buying some from Finest_One. But must of my TI comes from KI-401b. I have 20 smelters there, but the planet has TIO so I source locally through a friend that has an extractor base there.


[13-Nov-24 04:41 PM] igfloz#0000
awesome ! - sounds like we have an excess of TIO for the project . I guess Tanda and JC will probably start sending you conts for TI


[13-Nov-24 04:41 PM] jcheung#0000
can you deliver to vulcan or ANT?


[13-Nov-24 04:42 PM] jcheung#0000
and just making sure that 1500/u will work for you


[13-Nov-24 04:43 PM] razesdark#0000
Yep, 1500 is fine. ANT i can definitely do. I cant promise Vulcan delivery, I need to improve my base logistics before I can guarantee that


[13-Nov-24 04:43 PM] jcheung#0000
what does your logi look like?


[13-Nov-24 04:45 PM] razesdark#0000
I got 2xWCBs and a LCB. Biggest issue is me not having invested in bigger buffers so my ships are running constantly.


[13-Nov-24 05:06 PM] jcheung#0000
we share bases at a couple spots, how much shipping do you have going to agamemnon and deimos?


[13-Nov-24 05:08 PM] jcheung#0000
and then.... ki-840c what do you have going on there? are you export heavy or not really


[13-Nov-24 05:33 PM] razesdark#0000
Deimos is my main smelter planet. I'm very import heavy going to Deimos. I leave empty atleast half the time.

Agamemnon requires very little. I go there max once a week and i got some space left there.

KI-840c is a CUO extraction planet for the CU i smelt on Deimos. Its a pain in the ass tbh. I need to get a WCB there every 3 days give or take


[13-Nov-24 05:33 PM] razesdark#0000
Its late for me here, I'll check back tomorrow


[13-Nov-24 07:11 PM] tanda#0000
Do you know how much SI/LI we need?


[13-Nov-24 07:11 PM] finestone#0000
I smelt TI/SI/CU daily


[13-Nov-24 07:12 PM] finestone#0000
can also help if needed


[13-Nov-24 07:16 PM] evany.#0000
i'm gonna wager jcheung might have a better answer
if he doesn't then i'd need to ask existing smelters (namely igfloz who has already gone to bed) on what he's producing and then back-fill any gaps we have


[13-Nov-24 07:17 PM] tanda#0000
it sounds from current availability like I probably need to smelt some LI


[13-Nov-24 07:28 PM] finestone#0000
I currently do not make LI but have a planned base for it at some point

[13-Nov-24 07:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
you can send me contract But you have to pick it up at YK-005d for 330/u


[13-Nov-24 07:49 PM] jcheung#0000
assuming i have my math right, roughly 39 LI/d and 10 SI/d

[17-Nov-24 12:26 PM] igfloz#0000
Well, if you are making CTF on Vulcan - I can pick up from Vulcan too if required ?


[17-Nov-24 12:32 PM] igfloz#0000
FYI - 2K TIO @ ANT - I don't have the space for it at Vulcan


[17-Nov-24 12:33 PM] igfloz#0000
1K TIO available @ Vulcan


[17-Nov-24 12:56 PM] tanda#0000
I'm tight on space too on Vulcan (part of why I moved the CTF  off)


[17-Nov-24 12:56 PM] tanda#0000
and that's why I have the 30 day contracts, so it can be paid when money is available


[17-Nov-24 12:58 PM] igfloz#0000
I haven't set up the manufacturing yet (I have the build mats) - I'll have to source the rest of the ingredients for manufacturing before I pull the trigger - but yes, send the cont sir, we'll sort something out üôÇ

OK, i've picked up a small stock of PG. @tanda if you can send me some conts for HCC and CTF I can probably get LFE running soon.


[18-Nov-24 01:44 PM] igfloz#0000
I've only got enough LI for 3 runs of CBL, so maybe send me a cont for 9 CTF ?? that will get us 3 LFE


[18-Nov-24 01:45 PM] igfloz#0000
...and then I'll just be burning consumables while production is idle üò≥


[18-Nov-24 02:02 PM] tanda#0000

even a little might help to get the 1st batch of 10 LFE out. We haven't really discussed ongoing (longer term) production. Given that you have already supplied enough CTF for ~33 LFE, I guess its a runner

[28-Nov-24 12:32 PM] jcheung#0000
also schaitr is up to 930k/kit


[28-Nov-24 12:32 PM] evany.#0000
though we did try to track his price, we're also offering a complete kit not heres most of it go find these parts


[28-Nov-24 12:33 PM] jcheung#0000
also if jvaler is offering 0% loan


[28-Nov-24 12:34 PM] evany.#0000

50k on harmonia? last i checked it was ~30k/d on the high end


[28-Nov-24 01:01 PM] jvaler#0000
unless something like HER happens to be profitable in the moment, then you'd get ~50k/d


[28-Nov-24 01:06 PM] tanda#0000
most people looking to upgrade will probably be at the 3 planet or more stage


[28-Nov-24 01:09 PM] tanda#0000
mostly because most people won't upgrade until it's necessary, (and that's about when I started feeling the pain myself)

depends on your consumable cost ultimately, but like i said key word is optimistic there. i'm only seeing 21k/day on harmonia and ~38k/day on deimos

how much for a upgrade kit from a 500 ship to a 2/2 ship?


[03-Dec-24 01:29 PM] realharvey#0000
you dont upgrade a 500 ship to a 2k2k. Upgrades are better to 3k 1k because you dont need to replace as many items


[03-Dec-24 01:29 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
ahh ok


[03-Dec-24 01:30 PM] igfloz#0000
Also, I think a 2K/2K runs at about 6 million to build

@evany. Are there any conditions on getting a second ship kit e.g. 1 per person / needing to pay off the loan for my first? If not, could I request another please?


[17-Dec-24 09:25 AM] evany.#0000
I have no concerns about doing both as long as the finance side of it is ok @jvaler

It's a good planet with HAL and LIO, so you could extract and smelt on site and transport the LI in a 2k 2k easily

@evany. Hoping to upgrade one of my starter ships, I am a FTL fuel supplier so the build you posted in #psk-information is just about perfect.  How much would the loan be for?  I have 2m in cash or so - I just don't have a good idea of how much this all costs.


[24-Dec-24 10:19 AM] evany.#0000
I guess i missed the most important thing the price huh. 

Thanks for reading it.

its 1.35m
I would encourage you to still take the loan if you have 2m balance so that you can pay it back as its comfortable and not find yourself maybe struggling to pay for repairs or something that comes up, you will probably just be able to pay it off quickly in your case.

Yes, you should repair 1st. When you upgrade the repair will be more expensive

There's a need for AST and FET? I was looking at setting up a base for this, but I realize the cost of supporting workers, all that, is why the profit margins "look good" at first glance but aren't. That and how much dang TI is needed to support

o/ guys, new to corp, any requirements to apply for psk ?

To use? Well. I recommend being more established first


[08-Jan-25 03:04 AM] jcheung#0000
Maybe like planning 3rd base or if shipping demand is light, 4th or 5th base


[08-Jan-25 03:05 AM] jcheung#0000
This gives you a firm foundation so you can pay back the PSK loan


[08-Jan-25 03:06 AM] jcheung#0000
The final say would come from jvaler, the financer of the loans


[08-Jan-25 04:55 AM] altf4forbetterlife#0000
rgr that, thanks


[08-Jan-25 08:29 AM] jvaler#0000
starter ships should be able to cover at minimum your first and second bases(aside from edge cases)


[08-Jan-25 08:30 AM] jvaler#0000
but i've got no problem with you getting WCB kits early. the loan repayment is 15k/d, so if the bases are good that should be no issue

@evany. Im interested in upgrading a ship, but i dont want 3000/1000, in my case 2000/2000 is much more worth it. Is it possible to upgrade to a 2000/2000 instead? or is the preset ship kit non-negotiable?


[21-Jan-25 10:28 AM] jcheung#0000
It's not really worth upgrading from starter to LCB


[21-Jan-25 10:28 AM] jcheung#0000
You have to change out a lot of additional components, and we don't produce them


[21-Jan-25 10:29 AM] jcheung#0000
The LCB itself would probably not be too hard to make, but then you also have to do a bridge iirc

ah, I see. never mind then, the 1.35mil price tag looks a bit scary anyways üòÖ

yeah, upgrade to WCB is best


[21-Jan-25 10:31 AM] laaxus#0000
cheapest upgrade possible


[21-Jan-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
for new ships there arent much different between wcb and lcb


[21-Jan-25 10:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
for me there is, H2O is balanced in tonnage and volume, so wcb isnt worth it


[21-Jan-25 10:33 AM] jcheung#0000
Wait til you see the price for a full ship


[21-Jan-25 10:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
might aswell get mcb


[21-Jan-25 10:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah iv been told, 5 mil or something along those lines üò≠


[21-Jan-25 10:33 AM] laaxus#0000
wcb is worth it because it's less expensive


[21-Jan-25 10:34 AM] pagy1234#0000
wth


[21-Jan-25 10:34 AM] laaxus#0000
upgrade to LCB is way more expensive


[21-Jan-25 10:34 AM] laaxus#0000
than upgrade to WCB


[21-Jan-25 10:34 AM] laaxus#0000
hence why we recommend upgrade both starter ship to WCB


[21-Jan-25 10:34 AM] laaxus#0000
then buying ships that suits your need


[21-Jan-25 10:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
is buying ships specifically for your need more worth it than upgrading later?


[21-Jan-25 10:35 AM] laaxus#0000
wdym ?


[21-Jan-25 10:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
like if you buy a starter ship then upgrade it im assuming the cost will be extravagantly more than buying a ship with the correct things installed


[21-Jan-25 10:36 AM] jcheung#0000
What are you hauling that you need a LCB


[21-Jan-25 10:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
H2O


[21-Jan-25 10:36 AM] laaxus#0000
you don't buy starter ships


[21-Jan-25 10:36 AM] laaxus#0000
you buy finalized ships


[21-Jan-25 10:37 AM] laaxus#0000
so you upgrade both your starters to WCB


[21-Jan-25 10:37 AM] laaxus#0000
then buy either WCB LCB or VCB


[21-Jan-25 10:37 AM] flor2081#0000
yes, nobody buys starters just to upgrade, huge waste of money


[21-Jan-25 10:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah it was a shitty question


[21-Jan-25 10:37 AM] laaxus#0000
np


[21-Jan-25 10:37 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah np its very confusing at first, i get it üòÑ


[21-Jan-25 10:38 AM] jcheung#0000
Yes. Though you can plan ahead to a degree for upgrades, it also usually will cost you a fair chunk come upgrade time.

The cost for a WCB upgrade can be done as a loan and amoritized over time as well


[21-Jan-25 10:38 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah I'd recommend upgrading your starters to WCB first, through the grant probably?(idk how this works tbh)


[21-Jan-25 10:38 AM] jcheung#0000
You would be better off just taking a loan out and kitting out the ship the right way for core stuff (excluding some things that are easy to fit later)


[21-Jan-25 10:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
how much is the cost for a LCB upgrade? because im nowhere near forking over 5+ mil for a new ship, but I need more space urgently otherwise im fully stuck pretty soon


[21-Jan-25 10:39 AM] jcheung#0000
Loan

about 1-1.5M more


[21-Jan-25 10:40 AM] pagy1234#0000


[21-Jan-25 10:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
maybe its not worth upgrading at all rn, il probably just do this before buying a new ship


[21-Jan-25 10:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
damn


[21-Jan-25 10:41 AM] jcheung#0000
Is H2O the only thing you haul, and plan to haul?


[21-Jan-25 10:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
yep


[21-Jan-25 10:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
DW base


[21-Jan-25 10:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
so massive H2O in


[21-Jan-25 10:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
small DW out


[21-Jan-25 10:43 AM] jcheung#0000
You don't plan to produce anything else?


[21-Jan-25 10:43 AM] jcheung#0000
Oh dang, that's cheap


[21-Jan-25 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
that was for the upgrade starter


[21-Jan-25 10:43 AM] laaxus#0000
schaitr deal


[21-Jan-25 10:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
not in the near future


[21-Jan-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
just know that it is possible to handle 10 bases with 2 ships


[21-Jan-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
some people do even more


[21-Jan-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
it's just that DW is shipping heavy


[21-Jan-25 10:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
I do have a vision to eventually make my own H2O aswell, but yeah, thats still H2O


[21-Jan-25 10:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeahüò≠


[21-Jan-25 10:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
"with big money comes big shipping"


[21-Jan-25 10:46 AM] jcheung#0000
Technically... it's possible. You just use other people's ships üòÑ


[21-Jan-25 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, I felt the need for a third ship only recently


[21-Jan-25 10:47 AM] jcheung#0000
Well. Anyways. Assuming you haul only dihydrogenmonoxide, upgrade to WCB still doubles your capacity


[21-Jan-25 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
and I only have 12 bases


[21-Jan-25 10:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
dayum, pretty nice


[21-Jan-25 10:48 AM] flor2081#0000
i've got double your bases and 8x your ships :p


[21-Jan-25 10:49 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah but i dont think it will be worth it, I can probably hold out another few weeks if I switch to alternate recipe for DW


[21-Jan-25 10:49 AM] flor2081#0000
cant ever have enough ships


[21-Jan-25 10:49 AM] laaxus#0000
I believe it is


[21-Jan-25 10:49 AM] laaxus#0000
you'll need WCB eventually


[21-Jan-25 10:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
I was already scheming to put a 15% down payment and then 30k/d innstead of 15k/d to try and get out of debt asap, but if I do alt recipe and get to a point where I earn more money I might be able to get the upgrade with maybe a 50% down payment and 40k/d or smt like that. point is, if i wait longer, upgrade is easier to get :D


[21-Jan-25 10:52 AM] jcheung#0000
What happens in a few weeks?


[21-Jan-25 10:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
max out ship usage again


[21-Jan-25 10:55 AM] jcheung#0000
The thing with waiting longer is you're using opportunity cost-which you're welcome to do, but just know that time isn't free.
Being adverse to debt is fine and all, but considering interest free loan options, i would just not pay down faster and reinvest the capital in other things like making your life easier or making more profit.

[21-Jan-25 10:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
alr, I guess il do it


[21-Jan-25 10:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
double ship storage will get me at least to 30 FPs


[21-Jan-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
i think thats near the max of the area anyways


[21-Jan-25 10:58 AM] jcheung#0000
The other thing is, unlike loans IRL, any interest is charged up front. So unless the loaner offers interest refunds... you don't get anything out of paying faster


[21-Jan-25 10:58 AM] jcheung#0000
Granted there are a few that do that


[21-Jan-25 10:58 AM] flor2081#0000
i've seen lowstrife offer reduction in interest if you pay sooner


[21-Jan-25 10:58 AM] flor2081#0000

yeah so i just put it into Prun planner


[21-Jan-25 11:00 AM] pagy1234#0000
WCB should be enough unit 500 area max


[21-Jan-25 11:01 AM] jcheung#0000
I also want to stress that anything i say is just my opinion for your consideration-i don't want to stop you from doing what you want


[21-Jan-25 11:01 AM] jcheung#0000
There's a couple people here that i know that did starter to LCB


[21-Jan-25 11:01 AM] jcheung#0000
And they're doing fine


[21-Jan-25 11:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah but my reasoning doesnt even stand anyways lol, WCB is well enough until 500 area


[21-Jan-25 11:02 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah


[21-Jan-25 11:02 AM] laaxus#0000
ultimately

I dont even know what that means but the material being called IDC tells me all I need to know I thinküòÜ


[21-Jan-25 11:03 AM] jcheung#0000
It's a "simple" production chain with only workforce consumables and no input materials


[21-Jan-25 11:04 AM] jcheung#0000
Sells to market for a good number


[21-Jan-25 11:04 AM] laaxus#0000
basically, it's a very complicated and expensive money printer with extra steps

[21-Jan-25 11:07 AM] jcheung#0000
I believe you have to poke @jvaler for the loan, then evayoo when you have it. Would be me too if i could stop being lazy and actually request ship parts off evayoo


[21-Jan-25 11:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
lol, Il get too it tommorrow morning if i decide to go with it.


[21-Jan-25 11:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
thanks for the help


[21-Jan-25 06:13 PM] jvaler#0000
hold on why are y'all talking about interest


[21-Jan-25 06:13 PM] jvaler#0000
the PSK loan is 0% interest 90d return period


[21-Jan-25 06:21 PM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah ik theres no interest?


[21-Jan-25 06:21 PM] pagy1234#0000
Wdym?


[21-Jan-25 06:25 PM] jcheung#0000
Because they were talking about down payments and then paying down the loan as fast as possible, and i mentioned it was interest free, and that if there was interest it wouldn't matter if you paid it down fast since interest is precalculated... unlike most of RL.


[21-Jan-25 06:29 PM] jvaler#0000
oh lol


[21-Jan-25 06:33 PM] pagy1234#0000
Lemme just pay the loan fast broüò≠

you could probably pretty easily pay back 100k a week, lol

[21-Jan-25 06:36 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah it's 135k every 9 days, 10x


[21-Jan-25 06:37 PM] jvaler#0000
= 1.35mil

that makes zero sense but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è lmao


[21-Jan-25 06:38 PM] jvaler#0000
you can always fulfill the loan as fast or as slow as you want(aside from being 90d max)


[21-Jan-25 06:38 PM] tanda#0000

9? That's nice of you

1.2.... heh... *thinks back to a month ago when he had 2 loans each wanting over 2m a week (plus more loans)


[21-Jan-25 07:31 PM] jvaler#0000
no it just lets the math work out for a 90d repayment lol. 7 doesn't divide into 90 unfortunately

let me know when you are ready to do it, Il buy the ship kit then.

Dont upgrade 500/500 ships to 2000/2000


[22-Jan-25 08:44 AM] realharvey#0000
thats throwing away a lot of money


[22-Jan-25 08:44 AM] realharvey#0000
its better to build a new 2000/2000 ship then


[22-Jan-25 08:50 AM] realharvey#0000
Upgraded that Starter to a 2k2k requires to add a CQM which it adds to the cost

the WCB Upgrade is way more money efficient


[22-Jan-25 09:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
Does infact look like the material amounts dont even differ that much


[22-Jan-25 09:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
I am going to go with a WCB


[22-Jan-25 09:10 AM] realharvey#0000
CQM is about a million extra slapped on top of it


[22-Jan-25 09:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, iv been told that 2k/2k is about 2.5mil compared to 1.35mil for WCB, i guess thats where the cost comes fromüòÜ


[22-Jan-25 09:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
You seem knowledgable in shipbuilding though so I got a question for you, why is the CX for almost all ship parts fully dead?


[22-Jan-25 09:32 AM] flor2081#0000
usually people buy them all at once, like a full 2k/2k or WCB, so it's easier to go to the corps/people that offer full ships (GTU, riseoffilth, craftsman13)


[22-Jan-25 09:33 AM] laaxus#0000
because it's not as profitable as just doing DW


[22-Jan-25 09:33 AM] laaxus#0000
and it's very complex


[22-Jan-25 09:34 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah but if people like rise, schaitr or GTU put them on the cx there would be stock


[22-Jan-25 09:34 AM] flor2081#0000
it's just that they don't because it's easier to buy the parts together, i think


[22-Jan-25 09:35 AM] laaxus#0000
there wouldn't


[22-Jan-25 09:35 AM] laaxus#0000
there's a queue


[22-Jan-25 09:35 AM] laaxus#0000
for a reason


[22-Jan-25 09:35 AM] laaxus#0000
(which is they can't suppy the demand)


[22-Jan-25 09:35 AM] flor2081#0000
idk, lots of those shipwrights have decent stocks though


[22-Jan-25 09:36 AM] laaxus#0000
The only one with stocks is FIRE AFAIK


[22-Jan-25 09:37 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah could be that it just gets bought out


[22-Jan-25 09:37 AM] flor2081#0000
though thats just a good opportunity to sell it for a higher price


[22-Jan-25 09:37 AM] laaxus#0000

[22-Jan-25 09:38 AM] flor2081#0000

Wait, chains as in an item, or chains as in production chain/chain of supply?


[22-Jan-25 09:57 AM] laaxus#0000
it is profitable in absolute terms


[22-Jan-25 09:57 AM] laaxus#0000
it's just heavily complex


[22-Jan-25 09:58 AM] laaxus#0000

ah alr


[22-Jan-25 10:02 AM] flor2081#0000
but yeah the big problem is, you need a LOT of bases and ships just to make a decent amount of WCB


[22-Jan-25 10:02 AM] flor2081#0000
1 WCB needs 100 AST and 100 FET, and they're not light

[22-Jan-25 10:07 AM] pagy1234#0000
why on earth are there so many materials D:


[22-Jan-25 10:08 AM] pagy1234#0000
all of them have sizable recipes aswell, of which the materials arnt easy either


[22-Jan-25 10:08 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah if you want to get started and you don't have huge liquid capital, you need tons of loans just to get the end product


[22-Jan-25 10:08 AM] flor2081#0000
which is why most people dont do it


[22-Jan-25 10:08 AM] pagy1234#0000
for sure


[22-Jan-25 10:09 AM] flor2081#0000
cant just take on a 30m loan and say "yeah let me slowly build these 10 bases before I can start selling my product" üòÖ


[22-Jan-25 10:09 AM] flor2081#0000
30m is probably on the cheap side too :p


[22-Jan-25 10:19 AM] evany.#0000
production chain, the only thing i'd really be missing is cqm and its not worth converting starter to LCB, your better off spending the 6'ish million to buy an LCB and still upgrade your starters to WCB in my opinion 

probably about ~1mil savings


[22-Jan-25 10:19 AM] evany.#0000
actually i see harvey did a better explanation to you


[22-Jan-25 10:26 AM] realharvey#0000
The prun economy and more complex production chains can be very daunting. But over the time you'll get a good overview.


[22-Jan-25 10:27 AM] realharvey#0000
I am still staying very far away from the shipbuilding. There are some easy components to make but then theres trying to produce a bridge or crewquarters


[22-Jan-25 10:27 AM] realharvey#0000
thats usually the point where I stop thinking about getting into shipbuilding :D


[22-Jan-25 10:28 AM] evany.#0000
smarter man than I üôÇ


[22-Jan-25 10:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah no I get it now, im hoping to get a WCB kit

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o-ZbOtL2F0VrVDj75Pl_TAIjH8ImyLS3CfStu58XZS4/edit?usp=sharing I started mapping the ship recipe, its adjustable so I hope all ships need the same parts and you can just adjust the amount the spreadsheet calculates for to your liking.

No


[22-Jan-25 01:36 PM] jcheung#0000
But it's strongly recommended


[22-Jan-25 01:36 PM] jcheung#0000
The alternative is to travel to MOR

heh, heh - It was meant as tongue in cheek

I left my ability to detect that in my other pants


[22-Jan-25 01:42 PM] igfloz#0000
lol - ok, to clarify...... Appletree (afaik) hasn't talked about commiting to a loan, or ordered an upgrade, then evayoo just slings a contract - I found it funny. Never mind, I'll get my coat

first set of conts are sent, youll get loan cont when jvaler wakes up


[22-Jan-25 05:18 PM] pagy1234#0000
Nice, so as soon as I get the loan I just accept all the conts?


[22-Jan-25 06:45 PM] jcheung#0000
Accept now, pay when loan comes


[22-Jan-25 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000

Hey.
Saw some info on Deimos Global chat. 
So its 3000t/1000m3 upgrade for 1.35m, that can be loaned with payback within 90days with no intrest?


[23-Jan-25 02:59 AM] laaxus#0000
exactly

[23-Jan-25 11:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[23-Jan-25 11:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Deimos has a shipyard


[23-Jan-25 11:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
(Honestly we should just build one at Vulcan‚Ä¶)


[23-Jan-25 11:39 AM] jcheung#0000
i have a ship arriving at vulcan soon i can probably haul those ship bits over to a yard


[23-Jan-25 11:39 AM] jcheung#0000
hep or deimos probably


[23-Jan-25 11:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh yeah good point


[23-Jan-25 11:41 AM] pagy1234#0000

deimos shipyard pls :D


[23-Jan-25 11:42 AM] jcheung#0000
i arrive on vulcan in 7 hrs, so probably deimos arrival sometime tomorrow


[23-Jan-25 11:42 AM] evany.#0000
i thoguht about selling them directly from heph but not enough storage


[23-Jan-25 11:43 AM] evany.#0000
if someone wants to add ehh.. 40 warehouses ill foot the bill.


[23-Jan-25 11:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
you want any fee for that?


[23-Jan-25 11:44 AM] jcheung#0000
no, consider this just a service


[23-Jan-25 11:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
thanks


[23-Jan-25 11:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
but btw the materials are at ANT CX


[23-Jan-25 11:45 AM] pagy1234#0000
dont know what vulcan is

[23-Jan-25 11:47 AM] jcheung#0000
i won't have anything at ANT for a little while

ahhh, crap ! my ships left ANT 30 mins ago


[23-Jan-25 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
darn


[23-Jan-25 11:48 AM] jcheung#0000
yeah, i had a ship sitting idle for about a day i just sent off to vulcan 3 hrs ago üòÇ


[23-Jan-25 11:50 AM] jcheung#0000
@pagy1234 i think i can have it delivered in about 30 hours, will that work for you or would you rather bring it yourself?


[23-Jan-25 11:51 AM] igfloz#0000
ANT  to Hephaestus can be done in around an hour if you play with the fuel settings enough - you could be done in less than 4 hours if you move them yourself


[23-Jan-25 11:51 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah that works


[23-Jan-25 11:51 AM] jcheung#0000
that's true, if you have good alignment and high burn


[23-Jan-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
one of the conts is broken?


[23-Jan-25 11:56 AM] jcheung#0000
which one?


[23-Jan-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
nvm, autoprovision had visual bug


[23-Jan-25 11:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
fixed itself


[23-Jan-25 11:56 AM] jcheung#0000
what's the quantities on each of these things again?
1 each wcb, lfe, lfl, msl and then like 30 ssc and 70 lhp right? (going off memory so please correct if wrong)


[23-Jan-25 11:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah except its 34 SSC and 68 LHP


[23-Jan-25 11:57 AM] jcheung#0000
cool


[23-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
LHP i accidentally had the quantity wrong so its 64 + 4


[23-Jan-25 11:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
thanks mate


[23-Jan-25 11:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
btw, how will we transfer materials at the shipyard?


[23-Jan-25 11:59 AM] jcheung#0000
@evany. sent conts to finish out the 4 kits i have partials for


[23-Jan-25 11:59 AM] jcheung#0000
will pre-stage at deimos


[23-Jan-25 11:59 AM] jcheung#0000
do you have a deimos base?


[23-Jan-25 11:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
nah


[23-Jan-25 12:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[23-Jan-25 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, you'll need to rent 2 warehouses

üëÜ 

[23-Jan-25 12:00 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh k


[23-Jan-25 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
then i'll xfer it to you, your ship will arrive


[23-Jan-25 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
you'll empty whatever cargo and fuel you have on the ships into the WARs


[23-Jan-25 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
(don't bring too much cargo)


[23-Jan-25 12:00 PM] jcheung#0000
although before that, you can start feeding stuff into the shipyard itself


[23-Jan-25 12:01 PM] jcheung#0000
start by going to BLU


[23-Jan-25 12:01 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could rent one and then start loading the mats into the BLU you started


[23-Jan-25 12:01 PM] jcheung#0000
create the new ship design


[23-Jan-25 12:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
alr done


[23-Jan-25 12:01 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, one works if i'm online to finish deliveries-two allows dropoff while we're not both there


[23-Jan-25 12:02 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, now you go to deimos shipyard and then start an upgrade project


[23-Jan-25 12:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh you‚Äôre taking everything

Hello everyone, üëã
I'm posting a short message on this channel today to get help with the construction program.
I don't particularly need a loan, but I would like to take advantage of the reduced cost of improvement materials. üòÅ


[24-Jan-25 07:27 AM] jcheung#0000
Just want to make sure we're on the same page. This is a ship upgrade program, not construction


[24-Jan-25 10:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
Does the ship in the ship kit use the same amount of fuel as the starter ship?


[24-Jan-25 10:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
ik it holds alot more, but does it also burn it fast?


[24-Jan-25 10:56 AM] laaxus#0000
you decide how much fuel you consume


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
the engine is better


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
but cargo make it also slower


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
but tbh


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
fuel doesn't matter


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
at the end of the day


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
fuel will be a rounding error in your profits


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
so don't worry about it


[24-Jan-25 10:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
it does for me D: its almost 10% of my daily spending


[24-Jan-25 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
The ship will roughly consume the same amount of fuel per trip


[24-Jan-25 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
rough approximation


[24-Jan-25 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
(ofc depends on how much fuel you decide to consume)


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
in the same time frame aswell?


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
ah nice


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
ofc I say roughly


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats good then


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
if you want to be sure


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
and have precise number


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
you can test that with the BLU command


[24-Jan-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
giving you precise time and fuel consumptions


[24-Jan-25 11:00 AM] pagy1234#0000
ok, lemme try


[24-Jan-25 11:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
same FTL fuel, nearly double STL fuel D:

you should NOT max out fuel

wdym?


[24-Jan-25 11:04 AM] laaxus#0000
ah nvm misread


[24-Jan-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
I thought you maxed out fuel consumption


[24-Jan-25 11:05 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh lmaoo


[24-Jan-25 11:05 AM] pagy1234#0000
nah nah


[24-Jan-25 11:05 AM] pagy1234#0000
this is all default settings other than load


[24-Jan-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
btw you should max out the cargo of the wcb


[24-Jan-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
else it's not fair


[24-Jan-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
so 500t vs 3000t


[24-Jan-25 11:06 AM] pagy1234#0000
il never be using more than 1000t inside, since water is balanced at 0.2t/0.2m


[24-Jan-25 11:06 AM] realharvey#0000
you'd fly the little ship at least 2-3 times in comparrison


[24-Jan-25 11:06 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, this is not the best place for this conversation


[24-Jan-25 11:06 AM] laaxus#0000

[24-Jan-25 11:07 AM] laaxus#0000
you should stop thinking as a one base manager


[24-Jan-25 11:07 AM] laaxus#0000
and start thinking as a 20 base conglomerate


[24-Jan-25 11:07 AM] laaxus#0000
your number of bases will start to skyrocket once you get to two or 3 base

there's usually 2 that it swaps between

....there's two for STL as well, but it's basically the same as if you manually ramped the fuel to match, more or less

Keep an eye on fuel and damage when you do this. Sometimes one of those values go way up


[25-Jan-25 10:24 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh kk, will keep that in mind


[27-Jan-25 01:25 AM] gnarlicious#0000
Yeah sorry, wanna mean construction ship program, but it creates confusion
Yeah wanna mean "Ship Upgrade Program", I'm starting to run out of space in my warehouses and my spaceship don't have enough capacity to keep up with production.


[28-Jan-25 06:29 PM] evany.#0000
i'd clarify on that my friend
@gnarlicious 

You mean your having trouble hauling sufficient load and keeping the warehouse empty? Typically you won't store goods in a ship, a STO would be a better use of the area in that case.

If your needing to haul more let me know and i'll set you up contracts.


[28-Jan-25 06:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I think he can‚Äôt keep up with shipping and so the storages on his bases are filling


[28-Jan-25 06:57 PM] evany.#0000
yeah i just dont want to put him on the track to sell him a solution that he might not need yet


[28-Jan-25 06:58 PM] evany.#0000

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[29-Jan-25 12:27 AM] gnarlicious#0000
No, no, @.urpalhal bas right, the problem isn't with the warehouse storage, but with my bases, which produce too many resources, and I can't make enough return trips with the ships to empty my bases.
I'd also like to start making bases on planets a little further away, and my tank capacity is starting to be a problem.

At the moment, by staying very active, I'm managing to keep the base below 90%-95% storage, so for the time being, no. 
But help is always welcome ‚ò∫Ô∏è


[29-Jan-25 12:35 AM] gnarlicious#0000
@evany. Indeed is a yes !üòÖ
And just to clarify, I don't need a loan, as long as the cost stays below 2M

@evany. Hi! Im thinking about upgrading one of my ships with the standard wcb upgrade :) Could you help me out?


[03-Feb-25 01:27 PM] jcheung#0000
@jvaler  ^ will probably need a loan set up


[03-Feb-25 01:49 PM] jvaler#0000
gotta confirm that with the client first lol


[03-Feb-25 01:49 PM] jvaler#0000
usually evayoo lets me know tho


[03-Feb-25 02:43 PM] evany.#0000
hi, yep as long as you understand everything all i really need is a 'evan gimme 1' or two for that matter.


[03-Feb-25 02:44 PM] evany.#0000
so are you thinking about it or you want it? if yes ill setup some contracts and have a loan sent your direction @aromis


[03-Feb-25 02:44 PM] evany.#0000
if the former any questions you need answered post here and someone will answer even if it's not me


[03-Feb-25 10:17 PM] aromis#0000
Great! Im interested! 
What does evan gimme mean?

I want it for both my ships, but not sure if i should do them both at the same time?


[03-Feb-25 10:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[03-Feb-25 10:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But you can do both at the same time if you‚Äôve got the capital


[03-Feb-25 11:05 PM] evany.#0000
or th e willingness to pay the 50k/day per ship (i think thats what the loan works out to)


[03-Feb-25 11:16 PM] aromis#0000
Okey, 1 at a time then :)


[04-Feb-25 02:16 PM] jvaler#0000
wth üò≠ it's 15k/d


[04-Feb-25 02:16 PM] jvaler#0000
i wouldn't do that to people


[04-Feb-25 02:16 PM] jvaler#0000
@aromis ^ fyi


[04-Feb-25 02:27 PM] evany.#0000
might be worth putting a screenshot of the loan in #psk-information


[04-Feb-25 02:27 PM] evany.#0000
go ahead and send one to aromis for the 1 loan, will see if he wants two


[04-Feb-25 02:41 PM] realharvey#0000
@evany. just out of curiousity. How many kits do we have in stock?


[04-Feb-25 03:05 PM] evany.#0000
we can handle quite a few! so if you know anyone in the market let them know


[04-Feb-25 03:39 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I'm getting close but likely still at least 1-2 weeks out


[04-Feb-25 03:52 PM] jcheung#0000
I think our limitation right now is LHP/SSC? Which is available on market


[04-Feb-25 03:52 PM] evany.#0000
no limitations


[04-Feb-25 03:53 PM] evany.#0000
aromis's contract is up can fulfill about 15 ships today if necessary

[04-Feb-25 05:21 PM] freeloader4#0000
@evany. could i get a kit. Do i need warehouses on deimos?


[04-Feb-25 05:33 PM] jcheung#0000
If you choose to use the yards at deimos you will need a WAR or base at deimos


[04-Feb-25 05:33 PM] jcheung#0000
That being said, i don't have the upgrade kit fully assembled at deimos right now, so you'll probably have to get that from evayoo at the CX.


[04-Feb-25 05:34 PM] jcheung#0000
Caught me at a bad time or i would offer to ship the stuff for you.


[04-Feb-25 05:52 PM] evany.#0000

nothing stopping you from upgrading both at the same time with loans

May I apply for a second ship kit now? I need to do it before my I leave on my trip (2days) otherwise I will be unable to do it (well, not guarateed to be able too) for the foreseable future as my pro runs out in 5 days

[11-Feb-25 09:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
thanks alot, Im pretty confident that I will be able to pay off all 3 loans at the same time as now I am producing quite a bit more, and with less expense.


[11-Feb-25 09:28 AM] jvaler#0000
should be doable


[11-Feb-25 09:29 AM] jvaler#0000
my 2 loans come out to 30k/d which isn't nothing but it's only about half the profit of a decent base


[11-Feb-25 09:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, math tells me I should have 5d profit of 417k after loans


[11-Feb-25 09:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
currently have 5d average profit at 83200


[11-Feb-25 09:34 AM] pagy1234#0000
so pretty close to the other calculation, especially since I paid 1 installment of both my loans in the last 5 days

even if what you need right now would be a LCB

Speaking of updates, long overdue

Will be looking for another couple bases still in draft, One chemical one SME/FS
Please reach out to me if theres anyone interested.
We have been working towards rounding out the program to be able to construct full WCB's and we are missing one component now that should only take a few weeks to ramp this one hopefully.

Will share more specifics soon(tm)

@jvaler can give you then loan


[06-Mar-25 10:05 PM] .urpalhal#0000
then you buy the kit from @evany. I believe


[06-Mar-25 10:06 PM] infinit3kr#0000
ok because with these electronics plants the copper takes up quite the space, its doable but thats probbaly next on my list here to get a ship that can handle it better


[06-Mar-25 10:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah its a pretty seamless process

im 1/4 the way done my first cycle on the 6 new EDM plants

it takes about 24 or so hours for the ship to upgrade


[06-Mar-25 10:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so as soon as you get your ship to the shipyard with the parts you can get working on that


[06-Mar-25 10:09 PM] infinit3kr#0000
that would be no problem I bought some buffer consumables to keep things running

@evany. You mentioned a need for a SME base, you got the specs for that?


[07-Mar-25 04:33 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
@evany. So, the contract I got from you had 34 SSC in it, but the upgrade only wanted 32 (after I repaired -- the other 6 still in my inventory here are for another repair).

Are the extra 2 SSC expected?

Interesting, your job says 38 SSC.  Mine only needed 32.  Did you repair your ship already?  (https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1282880216217161729/1347517539579592724)

actually i lied, i did send it but its the wrong one. i fixed it and sent you a new one. pls term


[07-Mar-25 06:30 PM] vanarazor#0000
no I did not repair ship, okay so that implies tha I need to repair ship


[07-Mar-25 06:36 PM] evany.#0000
not strictly required, but highly recommended
if you have 20% damage and need 100LHP then you need 20 LHP to repair- if you have 20% damage and need 150LHP then you will need 30 to repair.
since your adding more 'base lhp' you will need slightly more to repair in the future - so its generally recommended to repair earlier.
in truth its probably only 20-30k so a pretty marginal difference depending on how much you pull in everyday.

the kit is in antares and would require two trips to move it somewhere, so i'd recommend you do what most do - take the parts to hephasteus (40minutes-2hours away)

[11-Mar-25 07:23 PM] ballpython2777#0000
awesome, Im ready to start the process whenever it is a good time for you all!


[11-Mar-25 07:28 PM] evany.#0000
@jvaler @sidepipe not sure how you want to handle the currency differentiation


[11-Mar-25 07:30 PM] jvaler#0000
i only deal with AIC, any conversions will need to be done by the other party


[11-Mar-25 07:30 PM] jvaler#0000
just tell me if/when/who to send a loan


[11-Mar-25 07:32 PM] evany.#0000
Maybe its better actually @ballpython2777 to just ask sidepipe to fund this one actually,


[11-Mar-25 07:32 PM] evany.#0000
for the time being ill send you the psk loan and you can pay that whenever you sort out financing.


[11-Mar-25 07:34 PM] ballpython2777#0000
ok so do I need to send a ship out to antares to build it? Im assuming I do


[11-Mar-25 07:35 PM] evany.#0000
yes


[11-Mar-25 07:36 PM] ballpython2777#0000
o7


[12-Mar-25 09:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
Will you accept ICA?


[12-Mar-25 09:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
Cause then I can just send out a loan in ICA and do it that way


[12-Mar-25 09:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can do currency swaps ICA-AIC as well, just trying to figure out how to do this with minimal contracts üòÑ


[12-Mar-25 11:46 PM] evany.#0000
even if jvaler sent you the loan its gonna be a recurring thing, i think the best way to handle it is to have you finance this loan if thats cool with you and leave jvaler out of it. 
they look like this

[13-Mar-25 06:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm fine handling the loan, but do you accept ICA for the ship kit? Otherwise I have to send BallPython a bunch of ICA and swap the money I just sent for AIC. Which isn‚Äôt the worst thing but it‚Äôs like 3 contracts üòÑ


[13-Mar-25 06:36 AM] ballpython2777#0000
you could send be the AIC to cover the ship kit then I just pay it back in the equivalent ICA right?


[13-Mar-25 08:37 AM] evany.#0000
I‚Äôll take aic or cis

{Reactions}
üëç 

[13-Mar-25 08:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
Basically, yeah - but to get you a loan contract in ICA, I‚Äôll have to send you the loan in ICA and then you basically send the ICA right back for some AIC to pay the ship kit off


[13-Mar-25 08:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs weird but it works üòÑ


[13-Mar-25 08:39 AM] sidepipe#0000

[13-Mar-25 08:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
Oh and it‚Äôll all be 1:1, so no exchange rate shenanigans to worry about. This is just the least worst way to get you an equivalent loan in ICA and still pay everyone in AIC

did you deliver to ant or heph @evany.?


[13-Mar-25 02:53 PM] igfloz#0000
I think it's ANT - It'll be in the contract


[13-Mar-25 02:53 PM] evany.#0000
its ANT


[13-Mar-25 02:54 PM] jab.sh#0000
kk


[13-Mar-25 02:54 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah, you can just load it up and take it to heph

[13-Mar-25 02:54 PM] igfloz#0000

[13-Mar-25 02:54 PM] jab.sh#0000
even for PSK?


[13-Mar-25 02:54 PM] jab.sh#0000
I know a full ship is 2 loads generally


[13-Mar-25 02:55 PM] evany.#0000
its barely but yes it requires two trips


[13-Mar-25 02:55 PM] evany.#0000
something like 560 tonnage iirc


[13-Mar-25 02:55 PM] jab.sh#0000
ah


[13-Mar-25 02:55 PM] jcheung#0000
One day I'll remember to finish staging these kits


[13-Mar-25 02:56 PM] bigtoot#0000
it's okay, I've got nothing better to do anyways, got a bunch of afree starting fuel.


[13-Mar-25 02:56 PM] igfloz#0000
You'll need a warehouse at Hephaestus too - for me to deliver to........ If you want me to take some stuff for you üôÇ


[13-Mar-25 02:56 PM] bigtoot#0000
Looking at the cont, I'm accepting the kit at ANT, where I have warehouse space already


[13-Mar-25 02:56 PM] bigtoot#0000
I can truck it over to the shipyard and upgrade one of em. I've got the fuel


[13-Mar-25 02:57 PM] igfloz#0000
but you will need to build the ship at Hephaestus


[13-Mar-25 02:57 PM] jab.sh#0000
oh is the PSK for both ships?


[13-Mar-25 02:57 PM] bigtoot#0000
no, just one?

I'm around... hit me up if you need some transport. I haven't left yet


[13-Mar-25 02:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000

@ballpython2777 heads up - sent you over the loan and swap contracts üôÇ


[13-Mar-25 05:53 PM] ballpython2777#0000
ok so I: 1. accept the ICA loan 2. pay it back to you to get the equivalent AIC for the psk


[13-Mar-25 05:53 PM] ballpython2777#0000
right


[13-Mar-25 05:54 PM] ballpython2777#0000
then just gradually pay back the loan in ICA ok i got it


[13-Mar-25 05:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
yep üôÇ


[13-Mar-25 05:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
oh, and by the way, don't advance payments on the loan unless you have tons of cash


[13-Mar-25 05:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
each payment is 9 days apart, but paying early just moves the rest of the payments up


[13-Mar-25 05:57 PM] ballpython2777#0000
ok cool, I just did the first one to get it out of the way and Im sitting on a big chunk of cash rn

Either EvoV shipbuilding if you need the ship now, or highlander if you're not in a hurry (very cheap but quite long waiting time, except for WCB atm)

I did learn when I did mine that... you might as well just accept the parts contract as soon as it is ready, since evayoo needs to provision them before you pick them up anyway, and I think we can trust the contract will get extended if the loan isn't provisioned in time.

[28-Mar-25 06:11 PM] tanda#0000
10 at ANT 22 at Vulcan


[28-Mar-25 06:13 PM] igfloz#0000
3 day cont ok ? erk... no, any chance of some being delivered to Phobos ?  - I only have 3 days left on Phobos


[28-Mar-25 06:14 PM] tanda#0000
I can probably swing that inside of 3 days.I've got a ship picking up from Vulcan right now


[28-Mar-25 06:14 PM] igfloz#0000
so I'll send a cont for 22 ?


[28-Mar-25 06:14 PM] igfloz#0000
..and the reminder 10 at ant ?


[28-Mar-25 06:15 PM] tanda#0000
you could do all 32 if you want, I'll just run a quick burn to Phobos with the 32 of them

@tanda Sir ! How's the HCC and CTF stock looking ?


[05-Apr-25 01:41 PM] tanda#0000
I've got 2k HCC, but only 14 CTF currently. What's your daily rate of usage? I am apparently not aligned


[05-Apr-25 01:42 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm a bit early for CTF, Usage is 2.82 / day


[05-Apr-25 01:43 PM] igfloz#0000

wym individual items?


[08-Apr-25 01:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think the plan for now is beginner ship upgrade kits and soon some full WCB ships


[08-Apr-25 02:46 PM] evany.#0000
depending on the item some of the individual items are on CX (though slightly more expensive than what can be received here.)


[08-Apr-25 11:24 PM] vanarazor#0000

@PSK With 9 days left on my pro licence and my ever dwindling inclination to log in and check things, I have decided that I should stop provisioning for the PSK project - @tanda apologies, no more CTF or HCC orders from me üò¶

I am still actively making TI - but who knows how long until I finally can't be bothered to even log in.

I will let my current burn mats get used and provide what items I have to @evany. so the project is not (currently) short on stock.

At some point, I foresee me listing all of my source mats (TIO / LIO / O etc.) on the CX - so it may be a free for all

[18-Apr-25 01:02 PM] pagy1234#0000
how much of those source mats you got?


[18-Apr-25 01:04 PM] igfloz#0000
err... >8K TIO, about 4K O - the LIO gets smelted into LI, not sure on my stock of that at the moment


[18-Apr-25 01:05 PM] pagy1234#0000
oh thats quite a bit

[18-Apr-25 01:07 PM] pagy1234#0000
may I ask how you make a profit on those items? do you have them fully vertically integrated?


[18-Apr-25 01:08 PM] igfloz#0000
the profit has been slow for me - I've probably invested money that I couldn't afford to burn in some instances. But yes, there is a fair amount of vertical integration here


[18-Apr-25 01:09 PM] pagy1234#0000
I see, thanks for the insight :D


[18-Apr-25 01:12 PM] igfloz#0000

[18-Apr-25 05:17 PM] pxlfox.#0000
TI/TIO fit into my overarching goal, so open for that. And PSK sounds like a recurring customer.
I'm thinking about setting up at least one FS base, so HCC would fit, too. 
CTF might be in, too. Have to see, tho.


[18-Apr-25 06:33 PM] tanda#0000
CTF and HCC I already supply, though I could move out of HCC if you have enough FS


[18-Apr-25 06:33 PM] tanda#0000
but yeah, don't worry about CTF, the ASMs I have are already underutilized

May I ask how many ship kits the projects makes (per day or per week average)
And what does the CTF burn look like


[22-Apr-25 10:52 AM] evany.#0000
well i can answer the first part, about 5 a week.


[22-Apr-25 10:53 AM] evany.#0000
how much CTF that is -- no idea. tanda will probably have a good idea though


[22-Apr-25 12:13 PM] tanda#0000
It's not a lot, honestly. We built up pretty heavily just with me producing 2.5ish a day


[22-Apr-25 12:15 PM] igfloz#0000
yeah - I was making LFE (using the CTF) - I was basically burning what tanda was providing


[22-Apr-25 12:18 PM] igfloz#0000
Hmmmmm....... I do have a pretty good stock of CBL on Phobos if anyone is likely to step in and continue to produce LFE for the project ?


[22-Apr-25 02:45 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Interesting


[22-Apr-25 02:45 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
What about AST/FET?


[22-Apr-25 02:45 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
(I dont remember if its AST + FAL or AST + FET for WCBs)


[22-Apr-25 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Both


[22-Apr-25 04:01 PM] jcheung#0000
Do you want to produce for the project?


[22-Apr-25 06:30 PM] vanarazor#0000
it is not actually clear what's the payout for the project,.. or this is simplt charity at the end??


[22-Apr-25 06:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Charity


[22-Apr-25 06:53 PM] jcheung#0000
Ish


[22-Apr-25 06:58 PM] evany.#0000
Basically the bases were built typically with the goal of 40k a day per permit


[22-Apr-25 06:59 PM] evany.#0000
you could (obviously) make better money doing other things, but the point was to reduce costs and offer the end ship kits to people with the lowest cost available to them

{Reactions}
üåà 

[22-Apr-25 07:00 PM] evany.#0000
So yeah what jcheung said, charity-ish.


[22-Apr-25 07:04 PM] jcheung#0000
Moving towards full ships but it's slow going


[22-Apr-25 07:04 PM] jcheung#0000
*very* slow


[22-Apr-25 07:07 PM] evany.#0000
and we were largely successful in that
originally the goal was schaitr level of pricing and i think we're pretty much the same price wise. Haven't really done a comparison for awhile.

in theory if we were profitable (making 60k+ a base) we would pay that person less and reduce our cost further..


[22-Apr-25 07:08 PM] evany.#0000
realistically i underestimated how much effort would go into auditing and tracking that lol. will probably re-evaluate all the bases once wcb kits are complete (probably 1 or 2 more weeks..)


[22-Apr-25 07:09 PM] tanda#0000
he's actually advertising himself as half the price of ADI, lol


[22-Apr-25 07:09 PM] tanda#0000
but we do have the LHP provided as well


[22-Apr-25 07:09 PM] evany.#0000
hes also missing several things


[22-Apr-25 07:10 PM] evany.#0000
larger fuel tanks, LHP/ssc, etc


[22-Apr-25 07:11 PM] evany.#0000
iirc his fuel tanks + lhp/ssc was 1.431m in my original spreadsheet which was my comparator price


[22-Apr-25 07:11 PM] evany.#0000
we came down by 60k lol.


[22-Apr-25 07:11 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah. Schaitr also runs at a loss, at least at his old pricing


[22-Apr-25 07:11 PM] jcheung#0000
I faintly remember him me tioning a price increase not sure how much it was bumped up


[22-Apr-25 07:12 PM] evany.#0000
i don't track it honestly, not a competition - the price is OK where its at.


[22-Apr-25 07:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Yeah.


[22-Apr-25 07:12 PM] evany.#0000
some of my bases are 0 profit to make those price happen


[22-Apr-25 07:12 PM] evany.#0000
so yeah i have no doubt hes taking a loss too.

Hey, just wondering if anyone can help me. i'm tryingto upgrade my ship but the fuel tanks and storage needs tobe empty? so like where do i put it? can i rent a storage at the shipyard?


[01-May-25 06:30 AM] shihidosama#0000
If not, do i have to get another ship there and use that storage? I feel dumb.i feel like theres an obvious answer here


[01-May-25 06:35 AM] laaxus#0000
the shipyard is on a planet


[01-May-25 06:35 AM] laaxus#0000
