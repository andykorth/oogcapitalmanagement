**ManoftheSea**:	Is there an ADM plan?


[02-Jan-22 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	ADMs are fucking worthless


[03-Jan-22 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Dropping the WAR fee 1/20th, and keeping the taxes?


[03-Jan-22 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	spending 10m to save 500/week is kinda worthless


[03-Jan-22 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	well maybe more like 2m


[03-Jan-22 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madnewmy**:	but still


[04-Jan-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	Yeah, I get that it wouldn't be *just* for the war.  And maybe taxes aren't much - 2 million to get 100k a week for 20 weeks is breakeven... but this planet is still small.


[04-Jan-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ManoftheSea**:	so, no, no ADM plans.


[04-Jan-22 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Sep-22 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AnotherOneAnother**:	always support engineers


[01-Sep-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hello fellow friends on Heph. The engineer loss was unfortunate but ultimately is the result of the previous Governor leaving without any transfer of the planet's financial reserves. When he suddenly decided to step down with minimal notice, only I stepped up to do something about it. I had never governed a planet before, heck, I'm still under 6 months into this game. But I started as a manufacturing specialty and struggled with it and here I am now, asking to be reelected to our manufacturing capital!


[01-Sep-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	When I picked up the mantle of Governor, which was so hastily dropped, where was OOG? Where was Allocator? The previous Governor was very public about his stepping down. After the election, I reached out on the UFO discord, asking for any advice or for anyone to come to me were there any concerns. Not a single person from OOG or Allocator himself, have done so. If he was concerned for the stability or health of Hephaestus' workers and engineers, why only speak up when the election comes around? The timing and lack of seemingly, any interest, in any communication seems rather self-serving rather than public-serving.


[01-Sep-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Thankfully, I know much more than when I started(though I am always open to advice). I've spent the past 3 weeks figuring out how it all works on my own. And as part of me as governor, I will always be transparent with finances. Since that first day, Hephaestus pulls in about 50k AIC of taxes each week for a total thus far of 101.5k, which is finally bearing fruit and showing up in the upkeep storage of Hephaestus’ Population Infrastructure.


[01-Sep-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As I said, the loss of some engineers was unfortunate. However, even before the election began today, I’ve started funneling the first return of taxes into repairing the damage done from lack of upkeep. Additionally, I’ve begun a festivities program that will ensure that next week’s POPR will show only positive growth for all sectors (though we got plenty of spare PIOs, so I’m not too worried about them).


[01-Sep-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Reelect me as governor and I promise these things: -No raised taxes. -An immediate turn around and gain of Engineers on the next POPR. -Stability and a safe buffer of extra workers. -By the end of next month, an installation of a university to help support the production of scientists for those with the highest tier of production facilities, the cost of which, I will donate. -Complete transparency of all income and expenditures upon request. -A governor whose only focus is to keep our planet staffed and happy, with no focus or ties to large conglomerates beholden to other planet’s upkeep.


[01-Sep-22 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	If you would support me and want to keep a dedicated governor in position to work for you, vote for me by going to buffer code "ADM ZV-307C" and voting for me, RiseofFilth!


[01-Sep-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	This man has my vote


[01-Sep-22 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	Mine too, I like me a fresh and engaged Licensee as governor!


[01-Sep-22 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	OOG might be a known name in the Antares Sector by now since they like to run for governor, but it is true that HEPH stepped up to the challenge, and i think giving them more than one cycle of governing to try steer the ship after the captain jumped board would be fair :)


[01-Sep-22 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Slomes**:	Furthermore if they win election, I will grant the governor from HEPH 400k in relief funds, which is about equal to two governing cycles worth of tax to top up the books again.


[01-Sep-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	That would be incredibly gracious! I know I was already planning on operating at a steep debt to the bank of planet as I reviewed the finances and looked at costs over the last 2 weeks if I was to implement improvements, but I was willing to fund it myself because I love manufacturing and this home of ours. Manufacturing is what I started as, and despite ANT's Electronic focus, I think we have the combination of resources and location to make Hephaestus truly special(AND PROFITABLE!!!).


[01-Sep-22 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As previously mentioned, every penny I deal with for our planet will be transparent and open to all the public. Any donations to Heph will go directly to ensuring smooth and ever expanding operations on our great opportunity of a planet.

**AnotherOneAnother**:	You got my vote


[02-Sep-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**allocater**:	RiseofFilth is correct. I was not concerned with the state of Hephaestus, because I assumed everything will continue to run smoothly. But seeing the decline of our beloved planet, I felt the situation needed to be turned around. Now after the recent engagement and communication, I am confident again that Hephaestus' best days are yet to come. I want to thank RiseofFilth for stepping up to the challenge and responsibility and I hereby withdraw my candidacy.


[02-Sep-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As stated in the discord, I wanted to thank Allocator, as well as everyone else, for putting his trust in me to help guide Hephaestus to a more prosperous future.

**RiseofFilth**:	Hey Hephaestus, as hoped, the proper upkeep and a little kick in the pants has turned around that bleed. The next thing is to get those rookie engineer numbers up. You will see soon I will be doing an engineer program to boost them numbers until we got every worker we need! I’m also looking at upgrading one or two of the smaller POPR structure to bump those comfort and culture numbers up to keep folks happy and not leaving their posts!


[08-Sep-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	might not be this week, with the a lot of money going towards a university, but it’s on the docket and we will see what we can do

**RiseofFilth**:	Hello Hephaestus!  1st off: Thank you for the reelection! It has been a busy week, so I hope you forgive me on the late message.  2nd: I've been saying for awhile that I'll release financials on request, but eh, I'll just post it here. Its a link that should work forever, and I update this spreadsheet near daily when something happens. It is posted on the UFO discord, Hephaestus Politics Channel. 3rd: BIG SHOUT OUT TO POKTER FOR HIS 500k DONATION! Seriously, it has been a huge help.

**RiseofFilth**:	Hello fellow citizens of Hephaestus! I am your Governor and I am seeking re-election!We have seen great progress in increasing satisfaction of vital workers, thanks in large part to a number of donations in either cash or in POP Infrastructure Upkeep. Additionally, we are inching closer to that lucrative University! It has not been easy finding a source to provide them at a decent rate, but between a few choice donations and a helpful producer, we are closer than ever before. I have even moving some personal production around. I am personally aiming at having all the necessary components for the university built within the next 3 weeks. Additionally, to ease the burden of upkeep, I will also be using some funds to do a wave of infrastructure upkeep across the board for our current structures so we might take greater advantage of the cheaper upkeeps. Check out the discord for our planet for more info and a link to our funding spreadsheet. If you want to help, vote for me, RiseofFilth!


[29-Sep-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Doing so will keep our upward development on track!


[29-Sep-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Also, considering making a donation! Any amount helps, and I will cheer your name from the top of the University steps upon its completion. Large or small, every AIC or DW helps!

[23-Oct-22 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	You wouldn't be a true politician if you didn't think that everyone loved to hear you talk as much as you do


[23-Oct-22 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Things are well across the board. We finally got that engineering shortage under control, with the next goal being the SCIs. Thanks to some huge donations, the University was constructed and we are starting to slowly get some SCI trickling in. I've instituted a couple of education programs to help move it along, but given the cost of direct immigration, that will be the best we can do unless someone would like to donate for them. Otherwise, all other metrics look good, with the help of numerous folks donating POPR upkeeps. I've looked into avenues to upgrade our infrastructure to reduce costs and have just put in an order for the HABs necessary to get our Wildlife Park (PAR) to level 2. That will be a big buff to comfort that will allow us to cheaply satisfy our needs. Likely, similar orders for B-fabs for the SST, INF, and ART are in the pipeline. So things are going well! If anyone has any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me.

**RiseofFilth**:	Hey Heph. Checking in with an update on a number of fees and so on, as well as expansion plans.


[07-Feb-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Over the next month or so, I'm planning on upgrading all (except university) the popr infrastructure as we are see very successful grow across all pops. In light of that, as well as looking at our neighbhoring planets rates, I have changes manufacturing taxes to be in line with said neighbors. For the most part, the increases are relatively minor. Pios are unaffected, SET from 20->25, Tec from 50->60, ENG from 400->450, and SCI to 800. Additionally, at the advice of some other players/Govs concerned that our planet might be used by other industries, like Electronics, and take from genuine manufacturing structures. With this in mind, I've raised taxes for all non-manufacturing industry work to disencourage use of our currently limited eng and sci. In the future, these changes may be reset and taxes lowered once these upgrades have been paid for, or if folks have a vested interest in anther non-manufacturing type of industry taking place on Heph. If anyone has concerns, I encourage them


[07-Feb-23 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	To reach out on discord to me and we can chat! I do not have any issue with some niche stuff happening. (For example, I've kept resource extract pio rates the same as manufacturing for INC runners)


[07-Feb-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Additionally, you will see increases in warehouse levels for those who want some extra outside base storage.


[07-Feb-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	When it’s all said and done, I’ll probably let the new tax scheme go for a week to get a reference income data point and then look at altering them to account for not needing to raise funds for all the stuff Xen is providing

**aceBaron**:	My SPF was established 180 days ago.  I still onlly have 18/20 SCI.  WTF?  Can we please focus less on planetary festivities and instead ENG/SCI pop?  Over 400 ENG jobs right now and I still need 2 SCI after 180 days.....


[12-Feb-23 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Slam dunk


[12-Feb-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@acebaron Per previous discussions held on discord and in this channel for Heph, I tend to only run extremely expensive pop recruitments for sci/ENG at the request of folks, if they are willing to sponsor it. That being said, the planet and tax base has grown considerably since then, and with. Xensor’s monster donations allowing for more happiness via fulfillment, it should be possible to maintain requisite happiness while doing non-festivity programs.


[12-Feb-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	tldr: I plan to look at running immigration vs education programs, depending on which would yield better results

**xensored**:	Happy to donate you 1mil if that helps to buy POPI inputs and fill everything for needed pop growth. Just have to exchange currency because I don't have enough AIC at the moment O_o


[14-Feb-23 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	nah man, good on money. When it comes down to it, I vastly prefer upgrading to maintain cheaper upkeep inputs than going to expensive inputs

**jackinabox**:	this is an advanced planet.  It can't be run for PIOs and SETs and then just get attention for the ENG when the dozens of players who use them complain


[14-Feb-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jackinabox**:	raise taxes on the advanced operations and tell us what is needed to fill the jobs


[14-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jackinabox**:	I'm scrolling up and seeing a fair amount of discussion about all this, but I hope the investments improve things and the focus remains on filling the advanced manufacturing jobs


[14-Feb-23 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@jackinabox Since I posted my original message to upgrade POPR infrastructure, I’ve only see one person “complain” about any such shortage, and it was Acebaron. The whole point of this is me pointing out the need for more infra to support all types of workers, as well as improve ENG/SCI growth. If your complaint is my focus is to focus on 90% of the jobs/workers happiness over spending excessive amounts of upkeep/programs to cater to only the ENG/SCI users, I suggest you take that up with Churv of OOG, as it was he who gave me such advice way back when I originally became Governor.


[14-Feb-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	With the new infra, I’m very hopeful we will see happiness and fulfillment to sustain direct recruitment efforts of sci/eng. This is really the combination of two things, happiness/fulfillment from more POPR buildings, and a higher tax base that allows for the affording of the higher immigration programs.


[14-Feb-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Am I Churv? What advice did I give you?


[14-Feb-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireFreak**:	fwiw, I, too, would like a sufficient engi workforce :D


[14-Feb-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As always, I’m all ears when it comes to advice and recommendations for way to better manage the planet and serve as Governor.


[14-Feb-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@Churaviis (sorry, I’m terrible with spelling) Unless I’m completely mistaken, (which is possible given the 5-6 months it’s been) you offered the advice to focus on finances and overall happiness and upkeep and to not break the bank catering to only sci/eng numbers, and if folks were super hardcore for it, they could offer to help fund the programs.


[14-Feb-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But to not go into massive debt for just eng/sci. (Keeping in mind, the planet had like 1/3rd the income/populatopn it does now


[14-Feb-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	)


[14-Feb-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Alas, talking with Chura, it must have been someone else 6 months ago. Either way, one of the originally contributors when I first took over offered the advice, and that’s generally how I have run things. If anyone has any proactive suggestions and tips, My ears are always open.


[14-Feb-23 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But until then, I’ve stated my current goals and plans above! Feel free to critique if you see a way to improve upon that!


[14-Feb-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jackinabox**:	my preference is to have high taxes versus fundraising rounds, but I can contribute if helpful.


[14-Feb-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	My advice is to build a 50 foot high wall of ENG/SCI infrastructure and make the EDC farmers pay for it


[14-Feb-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jackinabox**:	right now some of the POPI are inactive and it looks like comfort, culture and education are capped by health, so we could address that to unlock gains from the other categories


[14-Feb-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	Newly built buildings don't activate until the next POPR


[14-Feb-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Yeah, that was something else I noticed that it might be worth doing an extra level for health/safety


[14-Feb-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	also, what Chura said


[14-Feb-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I’m likely to give it a week or 2 and further upgrade if it’s still capping out


[14-Feb-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jackinabox**:	I'm calmed down, so will check back in after the next POPR.  if we still need help, we could ask Piboy or whoever the resident discord expert is on these things to take a look and give advice


[14-Feb-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I want safety outfits and DW alone to be able to provide what we need

[23-Feb-23 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Feb-23 03:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Feb-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Feb-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	There is no point stocking the ART, culture is capped by safety.  The real question is why the SST doesn't have OFF

[23-Feb-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I have 5k OFF on BEN and could bring some here, but I already contribute COGC inputs for 8 planets around BEN additionally to being gov on one planet and help with POPI upkeep on several. I hoped that I could avoid supporting also in ANT region because I have only 2 bases here on Phobos and Heph without a lot of ships. Only one ship goes BEN-ANT-BEN regularly. I can offer to fill POPI upkeep as a one-time engagement but it‘s not possible to regularly have a look here


[23-Feb-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	if money is a problem, that‘s no problem for me. I can just donate a mil. to buy POPI upkeep if that helps


[23-Feb-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	It is usually the governor who is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure


[23-Feb-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Feb-23 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	“Rely”


[23-Feb-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	I compared heph with other major ant planets. The tax rate of heph is not low, but there is still a chronic shortage of eng and sci, and facilities such as universities rely on donations from people outside the governor


[23-Feb-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	yes, other people donate things. But I’m no way are we reliant. It’s not like I can block them lol. And if someone else fills them, why should a Governor waste money to double down on something already filled?


[23-Feb-23 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	Deimos, which has a similar long-term shortage of engineers, has a very low tax rate.


[23-Feb-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Deimos is Governed by Bob, who loves to fund things himself. It’s not a 1:1 comparison


[23-Feb-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	He finds things with his personal wallet. I find things with taxes. Very different


[23-Feb-23 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	Then why are INF and ART empty? If others don't donate, can the university keep running? When can the problems of ENG and SCI be solved? Heph doesn't have the problem of SE farmers like phobos.


[23-Feb-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Are they?


[23-Feb-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	seems full to


[23-Feb-23 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	me


[23-Feb-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	To answer the questions I’ve seen raised. Infra is fullfilled. It was momentarily empty due to my being at a funeral for the past 4 days. I had planned to refill it yesterday, when it was schedule to run out, but I was tired from the flights home. They are now full.


[23-Feb-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As previous discussed, taxes were raised to afford upgrades/improvements, and then Xensor made some huge donations this past week. I am letting the taxes stand for another week or so as a data point and to see the latest (today’s) POPR to assess the new affects. My thoughts are, probably going to buy another health/safety upgrade to unconstrain the other fulfillments.


[23-Feb-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As far as eng/sci, I’m currently running back to back programs aimed at resolving the issue, but in all fairness, I do not control people building new structures and creating new demand. All I can do is the best I can with the tools available to me.


[23-Feb-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As always, I appreciate and welcome any suggestions and input people have on ways to better serve as Governor. I am available and easy to reach on discord on either the PRUN or UFO server. Same name as here


[23-Feb-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	particularly, if you know a way to massively increase education rates and drastically increase eng/sci numbers outside of fulfilling infra and running programs, let me know!


[23-Feb-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	For rapid SCI growth you can't beat SCI immigration (apart from spending a ludicrous amount on UNIs), so keep going with that.  SCI immigration will make a bigger impact on the SCI shortage than ENG immigration will on the ENG shortage.


[23-Feb-23 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	To get more ENG we need education, which means we need high ENG happiness, which means we need high fulfilment.  Comfort, culture and education are already maxed, they're just capped by low safety and, particularly, health


[23-Feb-23 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**melon164**:	Sticking a load of OFF into the SST and INF should unlock those and allow need fulfilment to shoot up, then we should see 60-70% ENG happiness next week and perhaps 80% the week after, which should allow for much more education (perahps 60/wk)


[23-Feb-23 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	My opinion is that if you don't waste the time for accounting tax expenses and long speeches , but making money, and then invest the money in heph, it will be enough for you to solve these problems in a few reports


[23-Feb-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**yuen**:	Players like you and me who have played for hundreds of days can earn enough money in one day to maintain Heph for a month. We can be more generous. Or you can continue to raise the tax rate. Players who need eng and sci don't care about it. We just need the result


[23-Feb-23 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@melon164 I’ve dropped additional OFF into the SST and I got 20 STR in the cooler and will stick that in the INF later tonight. I hope that is sufficient to give the boost you are speaking of!

**RiseofFilth**:	cooker*


[23-Feb-23 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@yuen pot, meet kettle? (I like my speeches tho) ;)


[23-Feb-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As always, other than the basics such as fulfillment and programs I am already running, if you have any suggestions, I’d love to hear them. (I think taxes are high enough and in a week or two, can be dropped back a bit, as they were only intended to help afford upgrades)


[23-Feb-23 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	(/upkeep)


[23-Feb-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	If I look at latest POPR, I'd say that unfortunately it was a really bad one. Compared to the last one and keep in mind that we upgrade infra: If you would have filled lower POPI inputs appropriately so that higher ones are not capped by safety/health and with festivities 3 program instead of SCI migration, we would have ended finally with happiness above 70% for ENG/SCI and POPR would have been better altogether. Don't have the time to calculate it, but POPR looks bad this time


[23-Feb-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I bought DW, OFF, SUN, STR, PFE and ship them later today from ANT. Additionally will send a ship with MHP and TUB from BEN tomorrow

[23-Feb-23 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I think with a boost of health/safety, it should be pretty good. I’m definitely gonna throw more b-fabs and up the safety station and health station up a few more levels… I’d like to keep it to cheap materials as much as possible to maintain the happiness


[23-Feb-23 04:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	IMO I’d hold off were I you. I think with the 2x inputs in each, we should see very good fulfillment numbers, given what we have now is based on 1x upkeep jtems


[23-Feb-23 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I’m hopeful that within the next month or so, with dedicated programs and an increase in upkeep items (pricy pricy), we will get the eng/sci we need.

**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I mean, you can TAKE it as a threat. Anything that gets us good POPRs is worthwhile ;)


[27-Feb-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	It wasn't a threat. I just try to help to improve the situation. Coming from BEN area with really well managed planets like Katoa or Malahat to Phobos/Heph was an interesting experience with a big difference regarding how the pop situation is


[27-Feb-23 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	You underestimate his power…


[27-Feb-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But it’s coarse, rough, and irritating! It gets everywhere!


[27-Feb-23 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Gilith**:	sand? did you mean SIO?


[27-Feb-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Ah yes, Gilith is thinking "how do I profit off the pain and grief of others?"


[27-Feb-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	I approve. Well done.


[27-Feb-23 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Checking in before the POPR. Just wanted to give you guys a quick update. I've modified the taxes and lowered them across the board for the non-Manu industries, Pio to Tech. I especially lowered the tech taxes for non-Manu as I had some good talks over the past few weeks over the way POP grows, especially ENGs. My home is that if folks decide to use Heph for non-Manu purposes, especially Electronic folks, they consider using it primarily for techs, as Tech pop directly translates to ENG growth(As well as techs are a hard pop to keep employed, not a lot of buildings use them in bulk).


[01-Mar-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	On the flop side, I've maxed out ENG and SCI taxes for everything non-manu as I want to disincentivize folks building IDC farming bases and the like, as we are quite short on them pops at the moment. They are difficult pops to maintain and grow, and I want to ensure they are going, as much as I have power to influence, genuine manufacturing jobs over someone's IDC money printer.


[01-Mar-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Just a quick note, with the help of a friend, I'm starting to build up A1E as a 2ndary Manufacturing planet in system. Currently growing tech and soon engineer population, for anyone interested. It will be about a month to get where I'd like it for my use, but I welcome anyone else who wants more Manufacturing space!


[12-Aug-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I do ask that if you are building anything with them big pops, give me a shout so I can communicate to the gov appropriately to make sure we get the right programs in place


[12-Aug-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Aye, A1E seems just a little bit expensive, however I haven't ran the numbers myself.  If you need cheap shipping, I have 4 dormant 500t/m3 ships within Antares system to do runs at cost to help keep our market competitive -- just ring me up if you need anything done.

**Inforiel**:	Yikes, I had not checked prices on CX for COT since last year when they cost 600 and 800 was expensive..


[26-Aug-23 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Inforiel**:	Or maybe I'm thinking of RCO


[26-Aug-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Aug-23 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	RCO when i first got into it was about 400 each, cot was 900-1000... it definitly has gone up :)


[26-Aug-23 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	RCOs a surplus market. Most of what people make typically goes straight into OVEs, EXOs, SUNs or gets converted into COT for PWOs and MEDs


[26-Aug-23 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	yep :) sounds right, i used to produce just RCO but after moving to COT, i haven't sold an RCO alone in a while... people like to take advantage when it's available and the time is right, but those that use it, tend to make it themselves


[26-Aug-23 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Id10t**:	most RCO and COT purchasers i've talked to was like... oh i can use my FRM/WPL for something else while i use your stuff


[26-Aug-23 10:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I keep all of my agricultural surplus. It will all get put to good use on my processing worlds, eventually. Due to the recurrent periods of instability on such markets, getting your hands on inexpensive product can be extremely hard, so I have a bias on having a decent stockpile around.


[27-Aug-23 04:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Does anyone have strong feelings to advocate for me to spend significant money to boost SCI immigration (120k a week) or to not and let it grow naturally?


[11-Sep-23 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Im inclined to let natural growth occur given the significant cost and minute increase in immigration


[11-Sep-23 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But i figured id ask for input


[11-Sep-23 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-23 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-23 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	realistically if you max out scientist happiness it'll get to 20/week. and the education is capped by the culture right now anyway.


[12-Sep-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	We seem to have reasonable baseline growth in scientists.  Folks building new buildings expecting faster growth feels like it is on them.

[13-Sep-23 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	@Rwinner16 seems silly, don't know why you would :)


[13-Sep-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	In my opinion the only usecase would be a massive LES --> ES (EES) production, but who will need that much ES/EES ?


[13-Sep-23 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	We don't have a GIN shortage, right?


[13-Sep-23 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	who would run an EEP on an RE planet? Losing ~35% from bad COGC efficiency means a lot with SCIs


[13-Sep-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	None of the SCI buildings have an RE bonus, I was just thinking about what use case @Rwinner might have in mind. LES/ES seemed the most likely. We should never underestimate what crazy things some players build xD

**Rwinner16**:	:P


[13-Sep-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Sep-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	One of those, if you build it, they will come?


[13-Sep-23 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yep, I think someone thought about smelting iron in KW-688 and settled on KW-688a. May be that was only because of your SHY to use a STL ship in the system for transport

**RiseofFilth**:	Man Rembo, you picked a bad time for that comment


[24-Sep-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hello Hephaestus! I just wanted to give a quick update on some tax changes and desired improvements that I am looking to address. The population of late has gotten to where current infrasrtucture is keeping a lot of the unemployment/spare population a little low for my liking. While settlers endless seem to breed like rabbits, the other pops are lower than I'd like. I plan on doing some minor upgrades to the SST and Wildlife habs to try and rectify this. Additionally, for those who have an eye on the financial spreadsheet for this planet, the debt has been slowly adding up, partially due to inflation of lower tier inputs like DW (not to mention those B-fab prices compared to 6 months ago). Debt has slid to around 5.5mil. Thus, I've made about a 5-20% increase in tax brackets. This may sound like a lot, but given they have been so low from the start, we still are below many other planets in various regards. Lower Pio/SET/TEC than Phobos. Lower or partity on 4/5 pops on griffonstone.


[24-Sep-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And those who have lower than us have typically said during their tax setting that the cited Hephaestus as a gold standard of price range, while being comfortable with running at an apparent loss. While I don't mind a little up and down, I want to make sure that Hephaestus is prosperous and balances the books on its own merit. I hope you guys agree, and if you have any concerns, I hope you reach out to me ingame or in discord.


[24-Sep-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As a small final note, I have changed the non-COGC taxes for ENG/SCI to be a little more friendly to other industries for those interested, as we have had a comfortable population and manageable growth from some time, and such high punitive taxes were only intended to prevent abuse. Seeing as we are healthy with our numbers, especially with the upcoming upgrades, I believe such punitive taxes for all but Electronics is unnecessary. Cause ya know. There are already 2 ELEC planets in system... they will be fine.

[24-Sep-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@Filth go ahead and crank up the taxes. Per company, most will incurr only a few grand of expenses per base, so it shouldn't be an issue, especially with the profitable ROIs and market volume of basic manufacturing.


[24-Sep-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RemboM**:	quit encouraging taxes, if you wanna pay so bad you pay! quit being generous with my money! (I'm being dramatic 95 percent jokingly, but I cannot resist)

**RemboM**:	as long as you stay away from a real tax rate like 57 percent, I'll cope ;) That's what I'm dealing with IRL hence the severe frustration with taxation


[24-Sep-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I don't have to encourage anything, just giving the feedback that was asked for.


[24-Sep-23 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Filth can hike it far beyond any recommendation, and there's nothing that you can do about it, aside from moving to Benten space, where you'll actually get a HQ bonus to manufacturing :P


[24-Sep-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Sep-23 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	176% eff :)


[24-Sep-23 10:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@rembom Also the intent of taxes are to pay for services for the public. From the sounds of things, you have a problem with the people utilizing YOUR money poorly, not the taxes themselves. 57% is pretty damn high, and if that was the true rate with no corruption or mismanagement, you would be getting every possible public service benefit under the sun.

[14-Nov-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	for those with APF/SPF, does anyone keep them at 100% duty cycle / efficiency?


[14-Nov-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	i'm trying to figure out if my eventually optimal setup involves keeping one manufacturing base at some combination of not enough eng/sci or not enough tec/eng/sci luxuries, to reduce upkeep


[14-Nov-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	even if i kept them supplied, i'm skeptical whether i could use/sell all the outputs.  but idk


[14-Nov-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I fully use all APF/SPF


[14-Nov-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If you could keep it fully fed, I bet the market would handle it; the market is currently vastly "hidden" from the LM/CX


[14-Nov-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	interesting


[14-Nov-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I'm running 6 APF + 2 SPF, best combination in my case


[14-Nov-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	o_o


[14-Nov-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	sufficient to support ship engines (mainly FSE+QCR combo) and also 2 UPFs for all BRx + CQx


[14-Nov-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	so if i look at PDA.AI1 for example. there are plenty of orders, but cxpc looks pretty empty. so you mean that at e.g. 3500, people would start buying on cx instead of corp markets?


[14-Nov-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	or is this one a bad example because it's consumed so slow?


[14-Nov-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yes, there isn't a lot of demand for PDA


[14-Nov-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I'd say that is a bad reference point, but most of the ship chain (engine inputs, engines themselves) have a severely skewered demand on the CX


[14-Nov-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	If you provide them to the open market at fair prices, they'll sell.


[14-Nov-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	so maybe ACS.AI1 is a better example


[14-Nov-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	for ship parts you need to organise your selling or like in my case you are in a position where you don't need to sell them

[14-Nov-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	you might end up with an inventory like this ^^


[14-Nov-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**I_am_Tex**:	Something like PDA…there are none on the market so a corp builds internal supply line.  When they show up on the market later, the corp supply chain already exists so why abandon it?  Self fulfilling prophecy


[14-Nov-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Yeah; if I could buy most of that xensored; I would lol


[14-Nov-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	not possible, I love to hoard things :)


[14-Nov-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	For PDA I have several hundreds lying around. From time to time I put some on CX and they sell within some days or up to 2 weeks. But I don't know if they would sell if you produce them at mass scale


[14-Nov-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	so i imagine (as always) it is easier to only sell finished products... which brings me to like BR1.AI1 / BR2.AI1 for example, which have even smaller apparent market.  what do they go for on corp markets?

**xensored**:	An example of a corp price list vs. external prices


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	from ex-NEM corp


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	i.. wha?? isn't that just losing money on BHP/LHP?


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	is that old numbers?


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	no


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	most corps have an internal pricing of basically break-even or low profit %. If you do break-even from T1 all the way up, everything looks cheap.


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	You should imagine this is not related to CX prices, only productions cost


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	i see


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	in corp you don't need CX and make ever product internal


[14-Nov-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	nothing is related to CX, only pure costs of production


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	so for a corp member, the reward of setting up complicated production lines is that you supply your corp with things that are needed


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	rather than profit


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	you still have a profit


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	but you'd have a similar profit mining aluminum, right?


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	for less effort


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	but you can't make everything youself. in corp you also get a lot of things cheap you don't need to produce or buy from CX for high prices


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	let's say someone produce all NN for you and sell them to you with low profit. Then you can make a lot of WAI you need but without the effort for stupid NN


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	ah


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	so nothing is a compliocated production line. i see


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	In my case I have 2 bases dedicated for NN


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	i've started trying to make everything myself. it's been interesting


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	later it's all about efficiency. I can't make DW and use an extremly expensive permit only for DW


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But we have DW producers in corp and I get it very cheap


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	at least, aside from random raw materials like AR.AI1 that i probably don't care to ever mine


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	yeah, i noticed farming/food/carbon/etc is really hard


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	permit wise


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	and logistically


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But if you try to make everything yourself, you will probably never have the opportunity to feed 6 APF and 2 SPF like I can


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	that is true. on the other hand, i'd be happy to keep 1 of each if i can sell the mismatch


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	And I can feed them without buying one piece in the complete chain from CX


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	But I have for example a minus of 8k PE/day or 400C/day or 1400 DW/day


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	but I can source them in corp for cheap


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	i wonder if you colonize planets (regardless of location), can it produce enough of those goods at 1 permit per planet?


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	or are there not enough cogcs in the galaxy


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	If I need something; i just build the planet infrastructure like I need it. I've developed several planets this universe


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	like OF-185b or LE-137c or JS-601e or Ebisu f


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	oh, right, you can do that without a governor


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	neat


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	for the lower tier buildings anyway


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	yes, in most cases I build an ADM and pay someone to be Gov for some weeks to run the immigration programs to speed everything up


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	also you can lease bases if you find the right people


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	yeah, i had someone propose me to run an aluminum base before


[14-Nov-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I have 8 external bases in addition to my own


[15-Nov-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Hernanduer**:	hey, that's how I came up with my name (almost)! :D


[27-Nov-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I was 12 though... damn that was like 20 years ago


[29-Nov-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@lukeskye Many a year ago, I was playing a lot of a game called Civilization. Eventually, the same game company produced a RTS version in the same mindset, called Rise of Nations. I loved it. Still love RTS games to this day. I also happened to be a big fan of a TV show at the time called Invader Zim. In the show, it was strangely capitvating by having incredibly horrible and disturbing depictions of cartoonish violence and general "Fucked up stuff" that came on and disappeared from the screen so quickly, it had you reliving it in your mind for days afterwards just to process what the fuck you were looking at. One such episode fixated on sewers and a cesspool. "Filth".


[29-Nov-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Put the two together. Here I am 20 years later.


[29-Nov-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	PS. Luke has 4 bases within 30 days. Well done!


[29-Nov-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	Rise of Nations? Really?


[29-Nov-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	omg what a nerd.


[29-Nov-23 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paris_In_Springtime**:	:D


[29-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Interesting. I've played a lot of Civ too, mostly Civ VI. Great game, but I think it has too many interacting features which cause balancing issues. I like this kind of game better because the free market moderates the relative advantage of each strategy.


[29-Nov-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	In terms of my bases, I was assisted by 10m worth of loans, which have allowed me to build out 450k/day estimated profit in a few weeks.


[29-Nov-23 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	Putting me months ahead of where I'd be without loans.


[29-Nov-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	loans are the way


[29-Nov-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	some of my best experiences with the game were when I still had 1 base but after I went through the learning curve. Personally I think the loan program takes that from people


[29-Nov-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**xensored**:	I agree but that's why you have to offer them free money or loans now, so they will miss something and there will be less competition next universe start ;) Think ahead....


[29-Nov-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I kinda wish they did temp "competitive" UNI's; like 3-4 months in length with customized rules and a set end-goal that ends the UNI.


[29-Nov-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Winner gets to name a planet/system/whatever here in the perm UNI.


[29-Nov-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	That would be a lot of fun


[29-Nov-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Like here's a odd set of rules that I personally would find enjoyable.


[29-Nov-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	1 ship, no LM's, 3 base limit per player, unlimited base size (each permit adds 250 area like normal): can have unlimited experts per planet; One central CX; Person with highest networth after XX time period wins.


[30-Nov-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I like the networth end condition.


[30-Nov-23 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I have a counter offer: unlimited ships, bases, permits, much larger planets, finite resources, starting planets with all basic resources, finite currency or based on a standard (gold standard, titanium standard, etc.)

**yngwette**:	that was one of my favourite games. i tried civ later but couldn't get into it, alpha centauri was so immersive


[08-Dec-23 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**yngwette**:	also re the corp markets conversation, how do cx prices stay so high?  like wouldn't it be in corps' interest to sell there?


[08-Dec-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	depends, but not really. I will often sell some of my stock if prices are inflated and I’m more cash poor than I’d like, but otherwise I try and keep reasonable levels for everything I offer internally


[08-Dec-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I think a contributor here is that internal prices depend heavily on vertical integration, which is often achieved by buying cheap off other people internally. If I have to buy inputs off the CX I certainly can’t sell for as cheap as I do internally, so I think that further incentivises preferring internal sales

**Hernanduer**:	what a sicko


[16-Dec-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	"Naked" is not a politically correct term anymore, you should say "garmentally challenged" or "alternatively fashionable"


[16-Dec-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	no no, those were the right words yesterday, now it's "a person who lacks garments"


[16-Dec-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	I must correct you here, 'person who lacks garments' is an antiquated, offensive term, which puts the blame on the victim who has had their clothing removed. The correct way to refer to such people is 'undressed'.


[16-Dec-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Churaviis**:	The term 'undressed' assumes that wearing dresses is the norm and is thus offensive to non-dress wearing peoples. The correct term is now "differently clothed".


[16-Dec-23 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lukeskye**:	But is it not vestionormative to assume that such a state is 'different'? Therefore, the term should be 'simply clothed' to account for their simple, yet elegant choice of attire.

**lukeskye**:	(If you have a base on Elon you've already seen this) Hello citizens of Hephaestus, a few of us are looking to invest in a COGC and administrative center on QJ-382a. It looks like a good place for manufacturing: it has a high MGS concentration, and its proximity to Elon makes for convenient manufacturing of nylon or kevlar. If anyone is interested in contributing L-fabs or solar panels, please send me a message. - Luke

[16-May-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	hold on let me check NL


[16-May-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	(PS, this is a good planet for BMPs as there are no adverse environmental requirements. A planet like Astraeus is best for NL, as it uses HSE, and it’s cheaper to make place buildings with large footprints, as it costs less HSE to make the full base.


[16-May-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	just checked NL on astraeus, it only gets me around 80k profit per day with 5 experts


[16-May-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	that's with 3 permits


[16-May-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	3 permits? That seems wasteful…


[16-May-24 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	PE gets me around 130k


[16-May-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	it's company policy that all our bases use 3 permits


[16-May-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Turn the NL into LDE on a construction planet and sell those lde at 10k a pop


[16-May-24 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	shipping is the easy part lol


[16-May-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	its the annoying part


[16-May-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	A NL producing base literally only uses/produces less than 20m3/kg per day. You don’t even need a STO is like the easiest base ever to keep supplied


[16-May-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	its not about the weight/volume of shipping, its that with 1 permit bases I would have 12 bases now instead of 4 that I would have to worry about keeping stocked


[16-May-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	And it’s only annoying if you don’t have access to buying new ships 😂


[16-May-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	you would also have like 50% more productive space and profit


[16-May-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	I know


[16-May-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	but I'm happier with an operation that's easier to manage


[16-May-24 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Fair. I don’t mean to bully. Just at the scale of stuff I’m doing, it would be impossible to run things like that. But for different strategies, it can definitely work and be easier to manage


[16-May-24 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-24 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	with my 2 GFs


[16-May-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Imo, I’d recommend getting some AMLs or whatever the structure is. stuff like AST, FET, and FAL are big sellers I’d bet


[16-May-24 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	i make use the stuff making cargo hulls and still have to go to market because one structure for cargo bays eats SO MUCH MORE than I can produce


[16-May-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	probably good margins 🤷‍♂️


[16-May-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	I did check AMLs a while ago but there was something about them that wasn't good


[16-May-24 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	either not profitable enough or not enough market demand or something


[16-May-24 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FreshFromage**:	checked - AST and FAL are not profitable right now, FAL makes 78k profit per day with 5 experts


[16-May-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-May-24 02:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Exeler**:	I can see it. I got into this game for the lack of time needed to maintain it. It respects my time and doesn't interrupt my life unless I want it to. Not everyone optimizes for most $ made per day. IOf your goal is most $ made per base, the 3 permit strat is undeniably the optimal way to go. Or if your goal is to minimize number of bases for some reason, 3 permits is also the way to go.


[17-May-24 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	I did it for simplicity. EW 1000 area gives me all the H2o/DW. 602c gives me all the FP power. Nike all the PP1-PP4. Phobos for MM cash.

**FreshFromage**:	3 permit legion unite


[20-May-24 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**EvoV**:	3 Permit bases are fine for the first 20 permits. After that, the cost of additional permits makes it difficult to justify 250 area per permit use.


[20-May-24 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TuffyLess**:	^^ this.  And as you get yourself more ships in the fleet, the logistical game becomes increasingly flexible with the downsizing of 3 to 1 permit bases.


[20-May-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	I dunno, even that just seems like a false economy to me. If we assume every permit makes a rather modest 50k/day profit for simplicity, then triple permits up to your say 18th permit would be effectively costing you 300k/d. That can buy a lot of logistics


[20-May-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**roganartu**:	*every 500 area makes 50k/d, rather


[20-May-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	Up until the huge burst of ship production, that philosophy couldn't hold true. Each empire was struggling to handle it's own internal support. Only by the arrival of new players did bandwidth show up.


[20-May-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rwinner16**:	But now, even a huge number of players still have less than 10 boats. It's still much more manageable to logistically handle the empire, but with each additional base, logistics needs amplify exponentially


[22-May-24 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Hello Hephaestus and good people of Antares. I've been your governor for what feels like as long as I've played. If I had to guess, Id say this is my 20th term. If you were unaware, a patch was deployed today that radically changes the way elections and governing operates in PrUn. What was once a benevolent dictatorship is now a power sharing among the highest voted members of an elected Parliament. I am unsure how the Devs heard players request "Let us gov multiple planets" and then decided that it was a good idea to impliment, "You need click 20 buttons and get to have 1-4 other people to click yes to pass a single change", but here we are.


[26-Jun-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	My goal in running Hephaestus, as well as (at last count) 16 other planets in Antares space (via friends acting as proxy governors), has always been to provide the best possible quality of population upkeep and management at a reasonable and self-sufficient tax rate. I would like to continue to do so as the head of government here, and on any other Antaran planet that is in need of good governance. If you have found my leadership of Hephaestus to be to your satisfaction(and hopefully uneventful, as governing SHOULD be), I would ask you continue to support me, and those whom I trust to aid me, in keeping this planet well managed.


[26-Jun-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	You will likely see many people running for parliament on many planets as its the new hot trend. While I appreciate and encourage you to vote for me, I know both Paris and Nano_xXx, and they are great dudes who I'd be happy to serve with.


[26-Jun-24 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Jul-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Just wanted to say, I've been governor here for now 25 election cycles. I hope during this time, you have found my management to your satisfaction, that you have always had workers in your factories, and not too many COGC gone wild notifcations spams during that time (though they have certainly happened). I hope you will continue to support me as your governor for this and another 25 election cycles, and I have the privledge of maintaining this planet as I have been, with a balanced budget and plentiful workforce for all newcomers.


[04-Jul-24 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Aug-24 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Nala.cat**:	@Hernanduer how does it feel to lose like that?


[03-Aug-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Nala, that is uncalled for


[03-Aug-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**sean_computer_man**:	Yeah, I'd say so lol. The policies so far have benefitted my very young base and the natural thing to do is vote for the incumbent until rationale provides an optimal alternative.


[03-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The point of these elections is to direct what people want. While it may be true that OOG tends to vote on corp ticker and not actual policy or common sense, that doesnt erase their desires. I always hope for productive discussions to manage this planet, among others, the best we can.


[03-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Aug-24 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Disregard previous message, I literally just woke up and hallucinated a different meaning to the words


[03-Aug-24 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I don't like the dialog that the only votes OOG members receive are other OOG members. There are 15 OOG bases on Heph, including long time inactive players.


[03-Aug-24 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Some people don't like the fact that the earth is round. Sorry flat earthers, it aint flat.


[03-Aug-24 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I simply mean you're minimizing the votes of people who are not OOG but vote OOG


[03-Aug-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	or for just an OOG candidate


[03-Aug-24 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	you just say that all the votes are OOG, when that's not true


[03-Aug-24 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RiseofFilth**:	Hey All, just wanted to give an update so you are all in the loop. I’ve just initiated a motion to raise taxes from 12/30/80/600/1200 to 12/35/90/700/1400. This represents no change for PIO, despite how small a percentage it would be, I would continue to want to keep taxes low for new players and the beloved BMP. The rest of the higher pops will see a 10-20% increase. The reason for this is at the latest calculations, the planet is pulling in 1.75mil or so a month, but upkeep costs alone at 1.6mil. 150k surplus a month is a little light for the costs of each new tier of POPI improvements. So I’ve spoken with other MPs, and got an approval from Paris, and have put the motion up for approval. I hope everyone on Hephaestus can support these changes, as they are for the health and support of our beloved planet.

[13-Aug-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As someone who does have SCI here, it went from 1200 to 1400, and thats not much of an increase.


[13-Aug-24 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	https://i.imgur.com/7YLBkgu.png a QCR, a regular item I build, is worth over 880k on the CX. Tax is 2700 to make it. Now, I dont have a math degree, but I can use a calculator. 2700 / 880000 = an effective tax rate of .307%

**RiseofFilth**:	And at the end of the day, all funds are for the upkeep and upgrade of the planet. Nothing more, nothing less, all at prices well below CX. I think its a good deal, and just the reality of upkeeping a planet like this.


[13-Aug-24 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm just shitposting here..... but your taxes aren't even close to being high.....


[13-Aug-24 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The devs made a "shadow" LR maximum POP fee. for SCI, the max rate, per day, is 219,978, per day, flat, not considering multiple buildings, or production bonuses.

[13-Aug-24 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	I was not complaining (unlike certain people on Malahat where the SCI taxes are half what they are here...), I asked a question, since 1400 is higher than Deimos


[13-Aug-24 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Malahat is geared for ENG/SCIs.... Cheaper to upkeep POPIs when you've got a goal established.

[13-Aug-24 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yes


[13-Aug-24 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	harder to ensure ENG/SCI retentions, thus, more cost.


[13-Aug-24 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	We welcome all refugees from the broken barbarian lands known to locals as Hortus, Benton, and Moria


[13-Aug-24 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	Hence why I was comparing to Deimos, where I know SCI rates are also inflated because it is a starter planet and so intentionally more of the tax burden is shifted to higher tier pops


[13-Aug-24 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	lets see...


[13-Aug-24 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	@draconisdomini All good my man, I didnt take it any other way. I just like talking about governing and taxes :)


[13-Aug-24 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	Like I said, I'm not bothered, I only have PIO and SET here, I was just curious about the rationale


[13-Aug-24 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Deimos is a quirky place, probably with some assholes on Parliament


[13-Aug-24 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	(like me)


[13-Aug-24 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-24 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	it's not cheap


[13-Aug-24 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DraconisDomini**:	Aaaand apparently I'm blind


[13-Aug-24 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	It happens to the best of us :D


[13-Aug-24 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Most governs, across the verse, can have better POPI upkeep metrics, since the capital sinks were invested, long before their time.


[13-Aug-24 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There's nothing going to say debt repayment, of whomever contributed POPI upgrade mats, for new shit.


[13-Aug-24 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	I agree that 150k/month for POPI upgrades is a bit slim


[13-Aug-24 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DraconisDomini**:	I budget for one upgrade every 6 weeks on Nascent


[13-Aug-24 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I do that on Pallada, but it's a sunk cost, and I'm trailing it out on the long term, to build up a revenue surplus for surprise stuff.


[13-Aug-24 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Like gateways, in like 3-6 months, or say GTU wants to upgrade their FER allocation on tha planet, or be it someone else....

[18-Aug-24 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Nala.cat**:	and i got 2 WCB FTL-capable ships and one WCB stl only in hortus


[18-Aug-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm literally saying for y'all to hold back.


[18-Aug-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Some govs are anticipating the future/potential expenses with these proposed gateways... Some aren't.


[18-Aug-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i hope the taxes arent super high


[18-Aug-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You won't know what you're going to be dealing with, until those gateways are built, and you know what the situation will be, with them.


[18-Aug-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	fair


[18-Aug-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	so lets raise taxes everywhere


[18-Aug-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	to pile up money


[18-Aug-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Be fair to all, is my only advice...


[18-Aug-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's literally a huge market speculation rn.


[18-Aug-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	molp can choose to divest into A-fabs, R-fabs, L-fabs, or something else..... We don't know anything, and no player should hedge any bets, on probabilities that they don't know.


[18-Aug-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I mean they can.... But it's a huge risk for them.


[18-Aug-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Not in the way that they'll be losing money, but they won't have much money to invest in spot-updates that get rolled, whenever they happen.


[18-Aug-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Which is why I say, save your money, and you'll be in a very good position to do whatever you want, especially if you have PRO, or something.


[18-Aug-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i mean if you've got a lot of money


[18-Aug-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	there's no harm in guessing


[18-Aug-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	not my situation tho


[18-Aug-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	If you're my cousin, @RiseofFilth (RoF / Roh).... Money is best spent where it's needed at the moment....


[18-Aug-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I mean, 138m creds got lost last week, due to bad #loans....


[18-Aug-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Do you want to know the details?>


[18-Aug-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm not providing them. :P


[18-Aug-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Look it up on #UFO.


[18-Aug-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i want details!


[18-Aug-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	you cannot tease me like that and then walk away


[18-Aug-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	#UFO ---> pirate reports ---> threads


[18-Aug-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	im way too lazy to switch tabs into discord lol


[18-Aug-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	you must


[18-Aug-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	it is the way of the community.


[18-Aug-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	okay i love drama i gotta do it w8 a sec


[18-Aug-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	we point everyone there... why are you so special that you cannot find our way?


[18-Aug-24 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	it's not drama... just bad deals


[18-Aug-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	like ~5 big time players, invested in 1 newbro, and everyone didn't know what anyone else was doing.....


[18-Aug-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Huge leverage for 1 guy... then life happened.... That's the details.


[18-Aug-24 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	so everyone loaned the same guy


[18-Aug-24 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's basically most of my argument in that thread...


[18-Aug-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	That 1 guys' friend wanted to repay everyone, but I gave a hard NO... bad for the community...


[18-Aug-24 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	No one is obligated to any serviving, that they didn't agree to, via in-game CONTS, or corp agreements. The latter has their own set of selection criteria, and I won't comment on them.


[18-Aug-24 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	There was some maths suggestions in there as well, but unless you know the maths, you won't notice them.


[18-Aug-24 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Some? Nah.. Mostly math suggestions.... The odd-one-out is the community suggestion, via that thread, per what I stated.


[18-Aug-24 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You need to deal with general risks, if you engage in generally risky activity, or have some continencies setup (like custom commodity transfer contracts + 1 week of notice), or someting that whomever figures out...


[18-Aug-24 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	You're a psycho and i love it


[18-Aug-24 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'm not. I like to deal with maths online.


[18-Aug-24 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I like to deal with people irl...


[18-Aug-24 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Those two preferences, don't generally mix well together...


[18-Aug-24 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	why not?


[18-Aug-24 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Do you do the #differential_equations, or do novel methods of mathematical research?


[18-Aug-24 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I've met 1 person, who can talk with me on these things --- and I love it.


[18-Aug-24 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Everyone else.... well, you can surmise that I don't have much common with them? Very little ground to flirt/interact, when you don't speak the same language. :P


[18-Aug-24 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	am not good enough with math but this doesnt mean i dont like them


[18-Aug-24 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	im always willing to learn


[18-Aug-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	So, you see all these bros who do the spreadsheets?!?


[18-Aug-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	*points his finger around the table*


[18-Aug-24 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	They do not do the #maths.... They instead do the calculations...


[18-Aug-24 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I can give you 1-3 ISBN #s via DM. The rest you'll just have to figure out by yourself.


[18-Aug-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	deal


[18-Aug-24 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	gimme those


[18-Aug-24 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	and btw i gave up on spreadsheets and prunplanner


[18-Aug-24 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	now i just use my calculator


[18-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	i've never used them... Prunner (legacy prunplanner)? sure, for quick base sketches....


[18-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	oh prunner


[18-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	But I always use a calculator, or a line rule, or just paper + pencil.


[18-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	never heard of it


[18-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	<--- old AF in-game


[18-Aug-24 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	<--- new AF in-game


[18-Aug-24 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i just use notepad + calc or irl calculator + paper + pencil


[18-Aug-24 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	my mom is like: wtf is this


[18-Aug-24 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	are you under 18 years old?


[18-Aug-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'll have to restrict my language, if you are, per community guidelines, ya know!?!


[18-Aug-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Who brings their mom to PRUN? Ohh right, @Nala.cat does....


[18-Aug-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You know,  you can register an account for her, so she can share in our #bean_farming suffrage.


[18-Aug-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	I am 20


[18-Aug-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	and my mom just sees the papers i leave around full of weird words like


[18-Aug-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	"RAT", "DW", "HMS", "HCC" and random numbers


[18-Aug-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	and my mom hates gaming


[18-Aug-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	all kinds of gaming


[18-Aug-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	so nope, no account for her


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	this ain't gaming....


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	she doesnt agree


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	It's a idler....


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	when i am coding stuff for work she claims im gaming


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You get the most of our this, with chatting with others in these planetary chats!


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	so i just gave up


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	>:O


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	and my dad only enjoys fifa-like games so another lost cause


[18-Aug-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Buy her a copy of #Screeps on Steam.....


[18-Aug-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that's gaming.


[18-Aug-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	this, is more socialization, than anything else.


[18-Aug-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	yea


[18-Aug-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	she hates me talking to strangers online, she says you'll steal my credit card or rape me somehow, but im 20 now so she cant really forbid me from talking

**Nala.cat**:	one day i'll write a book


[18-Aug-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	yeah... There's no way for that to happen in this game, since most of this is just #internet_relay_chat....


[18-Aug-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	"Life w/ my mom"


[18-Aug-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I'll toss you some ISBN numbers, with very general instructions, late tomorrow.


[18-Aug-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	okie


[18-Aug-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i'll wait for them

**Nala.cat**:	*stares at the computer screen 48h straight till you send them*


[18-Aug-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	LOL.


[18-Aug-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Worry not, it'll be a general method, applicable to anything you'd like.


[18-Aug-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Your mum should worry about her SSA #, being posted online, which happened last week, btw. :P


[18-Aug-24 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yes, if you speak Engrish, it affects you.


[18-Aug-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	which is their #high_school. They're not usually fluent, but they can speak with you on most things.


[18-Aug-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i mean in spain they also teach us english at the school, the only issue is the teachers suck at it


[18-Aug-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that's only because they haven't eaten true American potato fries.....


[18-Aug-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i've been learning english at the public school since I was 3, but only really started being fluent when I left school and i started learning on my own


[18-Aug-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Aug-24 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Aug-24 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spermatozoon_Saloon**:	Not content with the bowl of milk on the floor, Cat?


[26-Aug-24 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Mmm, the cat is getting assertive... Should this be concerning, or do they just some attention?

**sean_computer_man**:	I'll vote for good administration practices. Quick glance at the planet view and things look decent. I hope to see more voter engagement on behalf of the Parliament, but I understand timezone differences can be a bother.

**RiseofFilth**:	I doubt Hernanduer will run again, so there will be a spot. For all this high minded claims, he hasnt engaged, spoken, or voted once in support of anything.


[26-Aug-24 11:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	I know Nala is a robust and nimble cat choice, but I encourage anyone who wishes to run to state their platform, if they have one, or at least their desire to step up and learn the ropes. I welcome and encourage anyone who wants to get into governing! Who knows, you may be the next Gov ;)


[27-Aug-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	@RiseofFilth squeezing out any sort of public sentiment, from anyone, is tediously difficult, since we're all in here together, via a game. Hence, life + wife/husband + kids + priorities take absolute precedent, since the opportunity cost for participating in life is grievously high, whereas in regards to this game, it's rather low. You'd be lucky to get a comment, out of anyone, in that regard. Forming a general public sentiment regarding potential candidates is also a rough deal, should they ever decide to run for office, since few actually do vote per month, and within those distributions, you have the usual voting blocks to allocate. --- thus, they'd find it a hard occasion to actually garner enough votes, to get into office.


[27-Aug-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	To that, I'd say get active within in-game COMGs, UFO discord channels, or private projects, but there's only so much that just one person can do!


[27-Aug-24 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Beyond that, I'll state that I'm not going to run for any Antares GOVs, ever! If I ever did, I'd run with a seething, and scathing, mathematically determined efficiency that would make most run for the hills (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssHSg8lR7xo - some video porn if you're interested, for context) | [#im_a_spicy_pepper]. I apparently do this to people, unintentionally. Even without the maths, my rhetoric/poetics are usually scathing on their own. If you know of my policies at OT-580d, or YI-715b, then you could vouch for me, but I'm not running for office unless a good 3-5, well-established players ask me (via Prun in-game DM) to do so. I'm also pretty much open to any suggestions, but the players making them need to make their case. No effort == no consideration.

**Roh**:	@Nala.cat Silence of the Lambs (1991) American film, derived from the novel of the same name (Hannibal Series).


[28-Aug-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Keenmind**:	Nala you are running SF back and forth to Hrt station correct for storage?


[28-Aug-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And nah. It's a retouching of some pretty old European history. The moden TV series reboot does its best service to the late-medieval historical tropes. You'd have to go digging through some Italian Renaissance history to actually find it, but you can pretty much experience it through Lauro Martines' works (History prof, at UCLA).


[28-Aug-24 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	im moving SF to HRT to split it to some people


[28-Aug-24 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	and once it's splitted and i get my part, then i guess i'll use it or sell it

[27-Sep-24 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can keep the dogs/cats if you want.... But most breeds of dogs have been "dicked" for the past 100 years due to aesthetic tastes for their appearances. I think the Alaskan Huskies are one of the last pure breeds of dogs. Cats also have largely no purpose, when there's no rodent poptulation to control. Those animals were domesticated for purposes. Neither cats or dogs actually meet the social reqiuirements that kids need, nor do they tender the social lessons which kids want. Dogs/Cats are usually considered property, in urban environments. Birbs can just fly away if they don't like you (and yes, they will really try to fly away, if so). :P

**Roh**:	You could always eludicate your arguments? :D


[28-Sep-24 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Dogs are for guard duty + rodent control. Cats are purely for rodent control. Birds are for kids. Yes I've seen some breeds used for rodent control, and they've Very effective. Clearing out whole underground rat nets, with just some water + some terriers and pit bulls.


[28-Sep-24 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	When you clear out huge swaths of natural environment, just to prop up artificial means of agriculture, you lose the ecological dynamics that are otherwise inherent, like clearing out all the tress so your plows can till the soil with ease.... Means losing that tree cover which helps maintain predatory bird populations, who do eat the rodents with ease.


[28-Sep-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Then there is no ecological control over the aggregate biological dynamics, meaning now that those underground rodent colonies have free domain to wreak havoc on your crops, to tear into your houses, and to shit and piss everywhere.

[28-Sep-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	by biological definition (you should know this via your uni studies), humans are also animals too


[28-Sep-24 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can still read for free, which is also studying.


[28-Sep-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Ohhh, a specific course of study?


[28-Sep-24 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	^^


[28-Sep-24 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You think I care about what your predilections are --- I don't. If you're at uni, or any library, make use of what they offer.


[28-Sep-24 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Human discourse is a widely varied thing, and if you think that you're not apt to contribute towards anything resultant, which might affect your life situation, in one way or another, well then you're just not participating.


[28-Sep-24 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nala.cat**:	i just meant i dont study anything regarding animals. Moreover that was a rethorical question that implies someone would wanna eat you and you would be fine with it


[28-Sep-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I myself didn't officially study things in the biological sciences, but that doesn't mean that I didn't read into them. (American unis are expensive, for silly reasons).


[28-Sep-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	And, human cannibalism was, is, and will be a thing.


[28-Sep-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You can get less hard, and apply a form of exploitation regaring human politics and activity, over hundreds of years, and it is also a thing.


[28-Sep-24 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Cannibalism, but a rather soft definition of it.


[28-Sep-24 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Yes, it's actually a historical thing, in Europe as well. There's a long-running story from the Renaissance-era Florence - Italy, wherein one man's son was accidentally killed, via negligence, by another man's son.. The first man took the effort of exacting revenge upon that child, and feeding the meat to the other surviving party, as a means of revenge. Of course the man doing such deeds, was killed by the second, when that party realized what was done. Moral story + human condition.


[28-Sep-24 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Are we merely animals? Probably. I'd say that without a firm grounding in morals, the thing that we humans, in-common, have with one another, is that we lack humanity. You shouldn't read into it so much, unless you're able to think about it though. :P

**nomadhunter**:	We only added 11 scientists last POPR. seems like it will take weeks to fix it at this point. Maybe an education program in that case?


[26-Oct-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Anyone who is building additional SCI buildings while we are already at deficit is making an interesting choice in regards to their efficiency, especially as I've yet to recieve a single DM informing me of such new construction, as that is generally considered the polite thing to do if you want such a program. Additionally, if those people building the new structures would like to pay for such an expensive program, I encourage them to reach out with their name so I can send them the bill.


[26-Oct-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	But, happy to do it when I get that convo :)


[26-Oct-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	Otherwise it will passively grow within the next 3 weeks or so


[27-Oct-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nomadhunter**:	whats the price of an education program here?


[28-Oct-24 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	82k or so for the max level one


[28-Oct-24 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**nomadhunter**:	is that really that expensive? isn't this planet getting 1-2million in fees?


[28-Oct-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	The majority of our collected revenue goes to paying for POPI upkeep and the COGC, the remaining goes to save up for when we inevitably need to upgrade the POPI. Just last month, we built an Art Cafe, which was just shy of 2mil. Saving money for the needed upgrades is paramount and I do my best to avoid paying for programs that aren’t needed to maintain homeostatic population levels with natural growth. It’s why I encourage anyone who is building new ENG/SCI buildings to DM me, because it allows me to better plan on how to fill those population demands cheaply and efficiently.

[29-Oct-24 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	The old'school etiquette, is just do DM your GOV, if you're wanting to drop expensive stuff on their planet...  I'd think people have become complacent in doing whatever 'tf they want, with the POPR consequences to be handled ASAP, though. :(


[29-Oct-24 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	*(Where's my ENG/SCI POPI?)* --- I think we've seen enough of this chatter in the COMGs already! XD


[29-Oct-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	maybe, except for 26 days ago we were negative "homeostatic" ENGs


[29-Oct-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	which is, I'm assuming, why the art cafe was built


[29-Oct-24 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	just saying, you're not really staying ahead of the natural growth either


[29-Oct-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	also I would rather taxes increase by a tiny tick to cover these HUGE EIGHTY THOUSAND payments for SCI pops, than to expect individuals to foot the bill for what is effectively a concerted effort


[29-Oct-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	and I don't even have SCI


[29-Oct-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Hernanduer**:	I don't think taxes should be a race to the bottom


[29-Oct-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	My advice to folks is to DM me when you build structures that use ENG/SCI, or anything else that will cause a deficit, that way I can predict future demand an make the best choice with as much info as I can get.

**Roh**:	^always DM the person running the planet, be they GOV or PM. Why?


[02-Nov-24 02:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	You'll just have less issues when your planned expansion coincides with a GOV POPI boost, or POPR program.


[02-Nov-24 02:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	S***...... DM all of them... and see who's reliable, within a span of ~5days (it's Prun after all).


[02-Nov-24 02:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	I've tried to mention similar issues, in similar chats, but appartently people don't like my language, for whatever reason? They must be speaking the Black Tongue of Mordor, or whatever.


[02-Nov-24 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	On Heph, you've got a huge PIO + SET population..... They will always be eating up any higher tier upkeeps that people might want to invest in. You'll be better off investing like 100 mil AIC for lv 10 UNIs, to double the education rates, but yeah, that's at the discretion of GOV/PMs.


[02-Nov-24 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	Blame the devs. The maths behind POPRs suit high-tier pop development off virgin worlds, and not fully developed ones.


[02-Nov-24 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	... And no, that 100mil AIC is not a round-ball figure... It's an estimate. based off current CX figures, and my spreadsheet maths.

Feel free to read. I'm posting here as I've been governor and/or upkeeped this planet for a long time. I hope new and younger players will step up to keep the planets running smoothly. Feel free to dm me in discord if you need advice or help.


[12-Feb-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RiseofFilth**:	As a special note, this was my first planet over 2 years ago that I've governed before eventually running over 20 planets these past years. Its been a fun ride. Thank you Hephaestus. You have been and will always be my favorite. I hope and wish the best of everyone :)

[13-Feb-25 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	:D


[13-Feb-25 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Thank you all for your support in the ongoing election. I'm actually endorsing LiliDragon for governor. I also echo Rise's enthusiasm for new players entering governance, and she will do a great job here. Personally I'm looking for an MP seat on Heph, which I will use to run the gateway side of things. The ADI Gateway Coop is planning two gates on Heph, and the administration and toll income is expected to end up in the government context. Then I will distribute that according to the rules of the cooperative and be responsible for weekly gateway upkeep.


[13-Feb-25 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Archiel**:	Matters related to the planet will be the governor's job, as usual. I have a lot of other planets and space jobs, so I am happy to delegate that.

**Finest_One**:	just keep COGC and POPI upkeep and pay attention to pop levels.

**Finest_One**:	WE might get some benefit from hospitol levels as to not use TUB in INF

**Finest_One**:	outside of that everything else can be repeat filled if pop levels are good the only concern atm is SCI levels are low with low happiness.

**SilentReaper**:	HOS is pretty terrible.


[15-Apr-25 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SilentReaper**:	But not an unreasonable investment if you need more health and upgrading the INF would cost a ton.

**Finest_One**:	Actually you are correct for some reason i thought BDN outperformed TUB

**SilentReaper**:	Hey people.

**SilentReaper**:	I need a very small package delivered from here (Heph) to LE-137c. Willing to pay 7500 AIC. Total weight is like a couple tons or something, so very small. But needs to be delivered ASAP.
