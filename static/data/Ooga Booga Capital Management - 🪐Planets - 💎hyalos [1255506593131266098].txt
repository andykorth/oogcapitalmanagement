@akyantor I know you're only putting down a base later this week. Do you want to try your hand at being governor of uWu? 
You'll need to organise the upkeep (which the corp will help with, as you need).


[26-Jun-24 09:42 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I've spoken to Rise and he's happy to let a new player take the reigns and cut their teeth on uWu.

I guess we only need one guy to be higher than Rise, if we can't get 2 members

hey you didn't count me


[26-Jun-24 10:13 AM] archielvahr#0000
uhhh your entry on the sheet only lists 10 planets for you


[26-Jun-24 10:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
Apparently just no one submitted you to FIO..?


[26-Jun-24 10:15 AM] hernanduer#0000
yeah I have 27 😄

{Reactions}
😯 

[26-Jun-24 10:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's what I'd like to do. I'll be making some of the materials soon, like OFF.


[26-Jun-24 10:22 AM] akyantor#0000
It's relatively small, so should be managable with some support/guidence


[26-Jun-24 10:34 AM] archielvahr#0000
Okay the sheet just got mis-sorted so probably all those names were wrong (or they were right but on accident)


[26-Jun-24 11:27 AM] akyantor#0000
I've shipped out for WU-070a, so should have my base by lunchtime tomorrow. 🙂

[26-Jun-24 11:37 AM] akyantor#0000
Thanks for the votes folks. I should have 6 votes once I'm able to get my base online, which hopefully is enough to secure governor. Going to re-read that governing doc. 😛


[26-Jun-24 11:37 AM] akyantor#0000
It doesn't look too complicated of a planet tbh... cogc upkeep is small, and looks like the current person is only refilling the popi infra with DW/OFF, both easy to get ahold of.


[26-Jun-24 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Honestly for a PIO/SET only planet, you just needs DW and OFF in the SST and INF, and you're basically set.


[26-Jun-24 12:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
Plus the COGC mats.


[26-Jun-24 12:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
In a pinch you could run the POPI with only festivals, if you really wanted to

{Reactions}
🤮 😂 

[26-Jun-24 12:02 PM] akyantor#0000
That's good. I'm going to be making my own OFF soon, so should be very straightforward.


[26-Jun-24 12:03 PM] akyantor#0000
Just need to get that first batch of PG from the 759d base I setup yesterday.


[26-Jun-24 12:03 PM] akyantor#0000
Once I've got the base setup I'll do a run of the relevant materials, so I've plenty of supplies for the COGC and popi buildings


[27-Jun-24 12:47 AM] akyantor#0000
Rise has crept up to 4 votes, should get up to 6 once my base is built. Let’s hope he’s run out of puppets


[27-Jun-24 01:14 AM] akyantor#0000
I'll post a message on the plantary chat once I arrive. 🙂


[27-Jun-24 02:04 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
I think he's already run out of steam here. 
His only concern is about you being a such a new player. I've told him we'll all help back you up while you get to grips with things.

[27-Jun-24 02:06 AM] akyantor#0000
It's not a very complicated planet to run by the looks of it. Already calculated the upkeep supplies I'll need to bring in.


[27-Jun-24 02:07 AM] akyantor#0000
It should be fairly cost efficient as I make 2 of the 5 required supplies already (PE & OFF).


[27-Jun-24 02:08 AM] parisinspringtime#0000
Glad to hear it. I make tons of MCG; you can get that from me for free.


[27-Jun-24 02:09 AM] akyantor#0000
RAT/DW are relatively easy to come by... so shouldn't be a problem

[27-Jun-24 06:17 AM] akyantor#0000

[29-Jun-24 10:19 AM] akyantor#0000
Oh dear. Looks like there's a small settler shortage (600-ish workers).


[29-Jun-24 10:19 AM] akyantor#0000
Based upon the migration last time it should sort itself out with the next cycle, unless there's more demand.


[29-Jun-24 10:29 AM] churavis#0000
Just blame it on the previous administration


[29-Jun-24 11:01 AM] akyantor#0000
lol


[29-Jun-24 11:02 AM] akyantor#0000
May bump up the popi upkeep supplies, or consider a program when I get control, to get to a healthy amount of available pop (seems 10% is typical)

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Jun-24 01:12 PM] parisinspringtime#0000
I usually suggest 8-12% as a target, so yea, 10% would be perfect for Wu


[29-Jun-24 05:02 PM] akyantor#0000
Supplies on the way 🚛


[29-Jun-24 11:48 PM] melon164#0000
I think I'm going to drop my base here this week, that'll free up... 600 SET 😁

[29-Jun-24 11:50 PM] melon164#0000
Also I think I'm the only employer of TEC here, so they'll crash pretty hard with 100% unemployment if no one else picks them up


[29-Jun-24 11:51 PM] churavis#0000
The price of glass and all GF products is going to shoot up as soon as you close you base down

I've mirrored @archielvahr's good work on a governance ledger in #💰malahat-🍱ironforge : [WU-070a Gov Report](https://ingenious.foo/WU-070a)


[01-Jul-24 02:40 AM] akyantor#0000
Not settled on prices yet. Will probably tune them further.


[01-Jul-24 10:58 AM] akyantor#0000
Thanks for the votes folks. I received the governor position. I've already received an unsolicited advice pep talk from Rise via DMs. 😛

{Reactions}
😆 

[01-Jul-24 10:58 AM] akyantor#0000
I've refilled the COGC upkeep, and the PAR upkeep. Have the resources to refill for INF and SST when needed.


[01-Jul-24 10:59 AM] akyantor#0000
So far the income since last week seems a bit low... suspect it may have been running at a loss, but will see after a full week.


[01-Jul-24 11:18 AM] archielvahr#0000
Ah we should get an official OOG website and URL shortener, I noticed your URL


[01-Jul-24 11:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Not a bad idea. Could collate a page with governance reports for the planets we operate.


[01-Jul-24 11:26 AM] akyantor#0000
For what it's worth that shortner isn't very smart... I'm just using URI path redirects setup on cloudflare, but works well enough.

[01-Jul-24 12:18 PM] tuffyless#0000
this could be pretty slick! 🙂


[06-Jul-24 04:12 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm going to post an update in planetary chat tomorrow, but at the moment it looks lihe the upkeep costs average around 5.7k a day, and the income is around 3.6k a day. Will see how things shake out after a full week, but seems likely the taxes are undercooked at the moment, not by a lot, but by a little bit. *The research I've done so far shows they're lower than most other planets at the mo, so not really a surprise.*


[07-Jul-24 03:01 PM] akyantor#0000
FYI - This is what I've posted on planetary chat for WU:
> Good evening! I want to share a quick planetary governance update.
> 
> First, I've prepared an open ledger for contributions and payouts at https://ingenious.foo/wu-070a. I will use the ledger to transparently track the balance of contributions and payouts.
> 
> Second, after the first week, the weekly income is around 26k, with expenses estimated at around 33k. To remedy the anticipated deficit, I propose to raise PIO taxes from 10 to 12 and SET taxes from 25 to 30. My research suggests these are typical levels on other planets, so hopefully, they are not too unreasonable. And can be adjusted down if it turns out they bring in more funds than required.
> 
> As always, I'm happy to receive feedback. Reply here, shoot me a DM in-game, or contact me via Discord (on UFO/ADI/Prun).


[07-Jul-24 03:29 PM] akyantor#0000
I've stuck my head out on taxes... will probably be shot off. 😛


[07-Jul-24 03:30 PM] sidepipe#0000
hopefully you shouldn't get shot over a 2 AIC tax difference 😄


[07-Jul-24 03:31 PM] akyantor#0000
You'd hope not... I think a lot of planets will be doing the same in due course.


[07-Jul-24 03:37 PM] akyantor#0000
tbh, it occurs to me it's a bit of a dark art knowing how to set the taxes to bring in the right amount. Just have to keep making adjustments until you get the balance right.


[07-Jul-24 03:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
just like real life 😄


[07-Jul-24 04:24 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can always point out how much the tax actually costs.

If you are using an SME to make your taxes will go from 1.2 AIC per SI made to 1.44 AIC per SI. With SI at 1450, that results in a tax rate under 0.1%.


[07-Jul-24 04:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Vulcan is at 20 😉


[07-Jul-24 04:42 PM] akyantor#0000
I think it'll need to upped more. Just doing it in small increments until the books balance.


[07-Jul-24 04:45 PM] akyantor#0000
I realised after posting that the taxes weren't evenly set before... were already at 30 for Metallurgy. So the only effective change will be for anyone not following the COGC, and for folks extracting SIO on the planet.


[07-Jul-24 04:48 PM] akyantor#0000
I've been pretty fair on the assumed upkeep material costs... ended up paying out something between the CX avg and the mates rates I'd offer via the internal market. :S


[21-Jul-24 08:51 AM] akyantor#0000
Afternoon folks. I'm up for re-election on WU-070a. I'd appreciate everyone's vote who's willing to give it, so we can maintain corp governership of the planet. Thanks!


[21-Jul-24 08:52 AM] akyantor#0000
lol, already have three votes, some people are quick off the mark 😛

I saw it was a 2 seat election, i figure if the second seat is up for grabs and we can have an OOG lockdown of the planet, it will also serve as a good introduction to governance

[21-Jul-24 04:23 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
But priority should go to Akyan


[21-Jul-24 04:24 PM] akyantor#0000
It'll depend on how many proxies Rise rustles up, may be an opportunity to shuffle votes around. Let's see closer to voting closure.


[29-Jul-24 02:38 PM] akyantor#0000
The results... one fewer votes for me and rise this time around.

We were one vote away from being able to swing Shrewdsun into the second seat, perhaps next time.


[29-Jul-24 02:42 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I’ll still be around next time if we wanna go for it


[29-Jul-24 02:43 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I had changed my vote to you to secure it so we weren’t that far away


[29-Jul-24 02:50 PM] akyantor#0000
Ah, may well be doable next time then.


[29-Jul-24 02:52 PM] akyantor#0000
I've a credit to name a planet... been thinking of using it on WU-070a... but don't want to make a horrible error on the name. *Not in a rush, but so far the ideas I've thought of are:*
- Hyalos - *Ancient greek name for glass*
- Silconia - *A riff on the already excellent Halcyon*

Welcome any opinions, or ideas for that matter. 🙂


[29-Jul-24 02:53 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
I like the Hyalos personally


[29-Jul-24 02:58 PM] akyantor#0000
I think I lean towards that option from the two, but interested to see if anyone else has any other better suggestions, or strong preferences. Don't want to be the next Bober.


[29-Jul-24 03:06 PM] archielvahr#0000
I like Hyalos, I don't know if there's a greek god of glassmaking, but that sure works


[29-Jul-24 03:08 PM] akyantor#0000
I had a look, wasn't any that was a great fit


[02-Aug-24 11:34 AM] akyantor#0000
A friday whim, I named the planet. 🙂

How many bases do we have there?


[19-Aug-24 11:58 AM] hernanduer#0000
I voted which pushed him above


[19-Aug-24 12:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
If we need more votes, @ me and I can drop my spare permit there


[19-Aug-24 12:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Probably not the coolest move, but there’s no reason to kick Akyan out of the gov spot


[19-Aug-24 12:52 PM] hernanduer#0000
Filthy doesn't care, he just likes having his ego stroked by winning elections


[19-Aug-24 03:44 PM] akyantor#0000
It’s fine. He got 4 votes last time, I got 5. We’re at the same position as that election now


[19-Aug-24 03:45 PM] akyantor#0000
It’d seem a waste of a permit. 😉

FYI - I've made a request to the Phobos slush fund to expand the INF from 1->2 in order to build a better buffer of SET on Hyalos.


[19-Sep-24 10:49 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess my somewhat simple planet is about to get a bit more complicated. Someone wants to put ASM on Hyalos. 😛


[19-Sep-24 10:51 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Is that TEC or ENG?


[19-Sep-24 10:51 AM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
Somewhat put TEC on mine and I feel like I wasn’t ready for that responsibility


[19-Sep-24 10:54 AM] hernanduer#0000
just need a PAR and ART


[19-Sep-24 10:59 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, it's not a disaster


[19-Sep-24 10:59 AM] akyantor#0000
I think there is already a PAR built.


[19-Sep-24 11:00 AM] akyantor#0000
So would probably just need programs to ramp the pop up and feed to PAR to sustain them


[19-Sep-24 11:03 AM] akyantor#0000
I suspect looking at the gov helper that filling the PAR alone may be enough. And a program or two to build up the pop


[27-Sep-24 01:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
miscounted for my new base on Hyalos - buying 2 BDE for 10k if anyone has spares 🙂


[27-Sep-24 01:55 PM] akyantor#0000
I don't, but I will probably ship out a supply run tonight, so could bring them if there's no alternative.


[27-Sep-24 01:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'll go ahead and toss you a shipping contract just in case - my other ships are mostly running out towards OS-099 right now, so it'll take me a few days to make it back to Hyalos again


[27-Sep-24 01:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
put a super long deadline on it - no rush on picking it up. basically anything you do will still be faster than me flying my ships home and back out 😄

Hey, i would need 75 TEC on Hyalos, any chance we could run a program for it?


[10-Oct-24 02:08 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

[10-Oct-24 02:11 PM] akyantor#0000

50k for 100 pop

It should theoretically autoapprove before the popr tomorrow even if he doesn't respond. Will see.

worst case it doesnt pass, thats fine


[10-Oct-24 02:53 PM] akyantor#0000
Oh it'll pass either way, with only two votes the governer has the casting vote. Just will be close to the wire


[10-Oct-24 02:54 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000

FYI - Looks like Rise has dropped this as a planet as an MP. *Doesn't really impact gov ops as I've handled everything for 9+ months*

@akyantor Any interest in having an MP here? I'm looking for more planets to be helpful on and I've got plenty of storage here to hold upkeep goods. Plus you look all lonely on the ADM page by yourself..

By all means put yourself forward. It's not a particularly complex planet to look after.... just refill the COGC every 10 days, and keep the SST filled with DW, and the INF filled with OFF
