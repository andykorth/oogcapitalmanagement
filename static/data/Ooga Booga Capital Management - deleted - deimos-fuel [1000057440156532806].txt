Thanks!


[26-Aug-22 09:58 AM] yjhasaday#0000
@erklein I'm short on SF to fill your ads right now - sorry :(. I have plenty on Nike but haven't had a chance to send a ship to Deimos in a while as I've been busy moving bfabs and inputs to my new demeter expansion. So I can fill right away if you move your ads to Nike? Otherwise I should have another shipment of fuel on Deimos in about 24 hours


[26-Aug-22 06:45 PM] erklein#0000

Thanks, I meant to post two, but the second order is super no rush as I like to keep a little stock on my base there to keep my ships topped up.

Not super urgent, but I'm basically out of FF so if you only want to get one of them I'd prefer it was one of the FF ones 😄

I don't believe we have FF in stock for a few days still bc of YJ's vacation.  SF is available on Deimos, Phobos, and ANT


[04-Oct-22 10:01 PM] exeler#0000
Darn, I'll have to keep that in mind. I'm out of FF, but I have plenty of SF 😅

It's more appropriate to go to HRT to buy FF. I bought some and haven't shipped them back yet.

My Deimos stock of SF is empty. I’ll move more and @yjhasaday will probably do the same, but if it’s as convenient, the fuel is made on Nike or Phobos, so there’s always plenty of supply there


[17-Oct-22 04:05 PM] dehzhas#0000
Moved to Nike. I put up for more fuel as I visit Nike less often.

@yjhasaday is your best bet.  I do some SF at Deimos, but FF is at ANT for me.

No problem, 1k FF, 2k SF ads posted. I got it filled by jackinabox on Ant instead, but I'll take more. Deimos is a major hub for me so I need a good bit of fuel sitting there on a regular basis.
