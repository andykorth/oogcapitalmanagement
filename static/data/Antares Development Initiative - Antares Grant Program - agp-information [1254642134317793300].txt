# AGP Information
**__Updated:__** 26-Mar-25 12:34 AM
### What is AGP?
* AGP stands for "Antares Grant Program" and exists to provide ‚Ç≥1,000,000 AIC grants to less developed Antares-based players. (this includes those who are looking to move/expand into Antares)
  * We use the term "grant" to simply mean free money; you are not obligated to pay any of it back.
### Who is operating this program?
* The official project lead is currently @jvaler, however the other contributors operate somewhat autonomously. Determining who pays out grants is currently done randomly based on whoever volunteers first, which isn't ideal but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  * Said contributors are: @jvaler, @sidepipe, @archielvahr, @realharvey, and @.urpalhal.
### How can I join?
* You must have at minimum a BASIC license to receive a grant, as you need to be able to receive a player contract from us.
* We want to ensure that you get the most out of this grant, therefore we require participants to consult with knowledgeable or established ADI members to create a plan of action regarding what the grant money will be spent on.
  * We highly recommend familiarizing yourself with https://prunplanner.org/, it is an invaluable tool for base planning and getting a feel for the state of the game's economy. Remember to reality-check supposedly extremely high profit recipes by looking at their historical CXPC trade price as well as their traded amount.
  * Please don't feel restricted by the grant requiring approval of your plan, we simply want to help you avoid common pitfalls new players fall into.
* Once a plan has been made and agreed upon, you will be sent an in-game contract to receive the money. It's contract description should include relevant instructions.
### Miscellaneous Information:
* The old AGP channels can be read by collecting the @Archive Viewer role from https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1253487843574153257.

To be clear, I am not the only one running AGP. Post your questions and/or proposals related to AGP in #agp-operations instead of my DMs. This way more people can see it and give their input, and you'll get faster response times.

Are you lacking ideas for your new bases ?
Look at this ! https://prunplanner.org/tools/roi

Sort by ROI, and don't forget to check if the CX is able to provide and eat a full base of production !
