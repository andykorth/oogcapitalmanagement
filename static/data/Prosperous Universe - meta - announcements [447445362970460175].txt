@everyone, are you getting tired of your current desktop wallpaper? For the third year in a row, we've asked @mac2137 to create a game artwork in honor of Asteroid Day. Pictured here: the APEX interface, juxtaposed with the immediate consequences of its use as a management tool, in this case for an asteroid mining operation.

It‚Äôs been a big week at simulogics HQ. There is now a concrete plan for the next couple of months of Prosperous Universe in terms of its different phases, tests, features, and even its monetization model. First Access starts in about a month. Find out in our devlog what that means and what comes next!

@everyone This week marks three years of full-time development on Prosperous Universe! Incidentally, we're at an important point in the game's life, with our first big test being less than a month away. In our anniversary devlog, Martin takes a brief look into the past and tells you what to expect in the near future! :prun: üçæ

@everyone! With the new test approaching, our forums and Discord server will become more active. There are dedicated channels and topics only testers can see. If you have access to the alpha right now, but aren't assigned the alpha tester role on this Discord server or the forums, please complain in the #general channel! This should affect loads of people especially on Discord, but since many names from the game aren't identical with the ones here on Discord, there is no way for me to know. Let's get this done before launch, so everybody has access to the proper channels! üöÄ :prun:

New wiki page: EFFICIENCY FACTORS

https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/

It details the effects of worker availability, worker satisfaction, experts, soil fertility, and CoGC programs on your workforce‚Äôs efficiency. It also explains how consumables are used up, and it lists the spawn times and efficiency gain of experts. Questions on all these topics were quite frequent, and we hope that the new page clears things up. At the same time, we deliberately left out some numbers to reward players who take the time to figure them out on their own. Hope you like the new page!

@everyone Some people have said that our cinematic trailer doesn't convey a clear enough message of what Prosperous Universe is like. Today, we would like to make up for that fact with our brand new HONEST TRAILER:

Michi made a lot of progress on the upcoming Local Markets feature which in turn relies heavily on the Player Ratings feature. Martin was supposed to work on the latter but got distracted by improving the financial charts in the game. So we have to wait a little bit longer until the two branches converge. Only a matter of weeks, though!

It brings about the Governor system, allowing planetary residents to vote a leader into power who will control taxes, fees, and more, which will be redistributed to their Faction or Corporation.

I know I haven't been very active lately as a lot has been going on in my professional life, but Prosperous Universe and its community are as important to me as ever. If you've sent me a message these past few days and I didn't respond, I made sure it was passed along to the team. Of course, I'll stick around as a player both here and in the game. Thank you all for being awesome. I wrote a goodbye post if you want to know more: https://prosperousuniverse.com/blog/2020/03/02/mjeno-out/ :prun:

> Hey everyone!
> 
> It‚Äôs been two days since the Steam release and we are and have been monitoring closely what happens! First of all, we want to thank the whole community for their effort to welcome the new Steam players! The game's global chat has been flooded with tips on how to get started. It seems everyone is trying to help out the new players and explaining the game's ins and outs over and over again. That is so awesome, you people are the best! üíõ 
> 
> From a technical perspective the release went rather smoothly. No hotfixes necessary, no hydration timeouts all over the place. The performance improvements we implemented over the last weeks have paid off! Now that the Steam player base is increasing we also see more and more smaller issues with the Steam version. This is to be expected and we are working on fixing them!
> 
> Unfortunately there is one aspect of the Steam launch that didn't go too well and that is negative reviews. We are very well aware of the fact that Prosperous Universe is a rather niche-y game and not everyone is going to like it. It seems that the reviews roughly fall into two categories: The first one where players either like the game or have some valid critique why they don't like it. Nothing wrong with these reviews! The second category are players that only checked out the game quickly and didn't "get" it or didn't understand what we wanted to achieve. Sometimes it seems a missing feature, for example a translation into a certain language, is enough to give a negative review. These are the reviews that hurt the most üôÇ
> 
> Some of you already have reviewed the game on Steam and we want to thank you for that. There are some really glowing reviews that warmed our hearts and reminded us of why we are doing all of this! ü§© 
> 
> I know we start to repeat ourselves here, but if you like the game please consider leaving us a review on Steam. Even a one-liner counts! It helps so much with the visibility in the Steam store!

A few days ago Slomes contacted me and resigned from being a moderator. He hasn't been playing for a while and wasn't as active on Discord as before and felt that he cannot fulfill the moderator role anymore. @slomes: Thank you very much for being a part of our moderator team, much appreciated! If you ever want to come back, you know where to find us üòâ 
We could win @letsgo2u to fill the vacant spot in the moderation team. Welcome aboard!
