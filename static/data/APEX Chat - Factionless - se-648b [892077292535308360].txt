[02-Jan-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mhk**:	Only here for a week or two


[02-Jan-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Jan-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Hello


[23-Jan-22 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Hello! Has MoTS sent you?


[23-Jan-22 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	He mentioned that you wouldn't have excess any more, but this planet has been in my plans since the beginning.


[23-Jan-22 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	That definitely isn't true, I'm doubling the number of EXT I have as we speak, but there will always be more demand for BER since CBX is are good MM products


[23-Jan-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Oh, I guess I misunderstood. But I planned to do energy and engines from the beginning, so had always planned to have BER and LIO planets.


[23-Jan-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Well, I welcome the increased health and safety, as well as 200 extra PIO from having someone else on this planet.


[23-Jan-22 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Just curious, what price are you planning on selling your BER for (if you are selling it and not using it yourself)


[23-Jan-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I won't be selling outside my little corp.


[23-Jan-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Sounds good. I'm continuing to sell at 180/u on the LM as a heads up.


[23-Jan-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Great!

[27-Jan-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Howdy neighbors! I'm new here. How y'all doing?


[27-Jan-22 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Woah! We're multiplying!


[27-Jan-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Just before POPR too! Good timing


[27-Jan-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	What are you here for? BER I presume?


[27-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi! yeah, I rushed to set up before the POPR. :)


[27-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Is this your second base?


[27-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Yep. 2nd base.


[27-Jan-22 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I started on Promitor as a farmer, but I've been moving toward chemistry


[27-Jan-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Nice. Well, there's lots of demand for BER if you sell it at the right price


[27-Jan-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Although construction is expensive here because of the INS needed


[27-Jan-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Yeah, I noticed. :)


[27-Jan-22 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Shipping it back towards HOR?


[27-Jan-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I like the location here because it's good proximity to HRT and ANT, and I would like to build up my capacity to supply NS and DDT to Prom from here.


[27-Jan-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	How about you? What are you up to? BER mining?


[27-Jan-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep, 5 EXT churning away. More inbound soon.


[27-Jan-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	So are you here for the DW or the BER?


[27-Jan-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	*H2O


[27-Jan-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	A little of both.


[27-Jan-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Mainly location and the chemistry bonus for being outside of faction space


[27-Jan-22 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ok. That's the reason I settled here too initially.


[27-Jan-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Where are your other base(s)


[27-Jan-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Gibson, Griffonstone, Nemesis, Proxion, and one on its way to a not-yet-disclosed planet


[27-Jan-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Oh my!


[27-Jan-22 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	By the way, I knew this was your second base because I checked out your company here: https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/view-company?company=NOWA


[27-Jan-22 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Oh cool! I didn't know about this tool


[27-Jan-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Welcome! I just arrived a few days ago. Here for the BER.


[27-Jan-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks! Nice to meet you as well.


[27-Jan-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Are you guys selling the BER or processing it yourselves?


[27-Jan-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Both. I've got 1 AML working, but I've also been selling to MoTS and others


[28-Jan-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I just harvest here for myself and corpmates. I process on Phobos.


[30-Jan-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Thanks for finishing the WAR! I was planning to do that in a week or two. Was that you @Scorus?


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Yeah, every planet should have a WAR! :)


[31-Jan-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Outstanding! Thanks so much Scorus!


[31-Jan-22 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Should we start thnking about a POPI strategy. I'm new to the subject. Is there an investment we should start making in safety, etc?


[31-Jan-22 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	We don't need to. We should be able to support pretty much as large a pioneer population as we need with just our bases.


[31-Jan-22 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	And you should be able to get your settlers slowly but surely. Happiness is averaged over the past 5 weeks, so that's why settler happiness was 40%. It will be 65% next week, and 85% the week after that when migration will kick in.


[31-Jan-22 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Awesome! Ok good to know.


[11-Feb-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	If anyone is making a supply run from Antares in the next couple of days, I'd like to set up some shipping contracts.


[11-Feb-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Scorus I am, put shipping ads up on the LM


[11-Feb-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I'll put them up here since that is free. :)


[11-Feb-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Ads up


[11-Feb-22 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	There's an LM bug going around where the ads don't show up. What are the ad IDs?


[12-Feb-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I see the ads. Picking them up now.


[12-Feb-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	One isn't provisioned yet.


[12-Feb-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Sorry, done.


[14-Feb-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Gonna cash in on all this tax revenue? :)


[14-Feb-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Nope, taxes stay at zero. But I want a fancy governor title and more PIO


[14-Feb-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I've got to do something with ADR money... Might as well get myself a long list of titles


[14-Feb-22 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	One of you two can be governor after this term... I'll build another ADM on another planet in a month.


[15-Feb-22 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Sounds good to me! Good luck Governor PiBoy314!


[15-Feb-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	No, no urge for power for me!


[15-Feb-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Ok. I would love to be governor eventually, as I plan for this to be my home planet going forward. But as long as you intend to keep low/no taxes for now, I don't have any ambition to stand in your way. :)


[15-Feb-22 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yep, I just want it purely for the governor title on my USR card. It's also a plus that we can get 500 PIO per week. Although it looks like open jobs will be filled next POPR so I could fill all your settler jobs within 2 weeks


[16-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	And next will come Engineers so we can run AMLs here? :)


[16-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	That's the dream!


[16-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I don’t plan on running that, unless someone wants to pay for it. I’m very happy with my 163%, soon to be 173% efficiency on Griffonstone


[16-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	But a COGC isn’t out of the question…


[16-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	@PiBoy314 - That's a looooong term vision. I think this place has a lot of value as a Chemistry hub. There isn't one that serves HRT, and the proximity to ANT is a big plus. The closest Chem hub to HRT is Circe, which is really oriented toward MOR.


[16-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	@Scorus - did you notice that I just built a Lab to open some TEC jobs before the POPR or something?


[16-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@deNoailles maybe you’re right. I’m mainly focused on BEN and ANT so Griffonstone is my hub of choice. It sounds like you’ll make good use of the governor programs though…


[17-Feb-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	AYYYY!!! We have our first TEC!


[17-Feb-22 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Should get quite a few more next POPR with the extra settlers


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Congrats Governor PiBoy!


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	If I understand correctly the new Programs, we'll get 200 new SETs next POPR and 100 new TEC the week after., correct?


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Does anyone else plan to use SET and TEC?


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	And what do these programs cost? I'm happy to start paying taxes to support these higher tiers, especially if I'm the only one using them.


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Also, I'm saving up to build us a Safety Station. Let me know when you think it's the right time to stand one up.


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Probably within a week or two? You’ll only need to feed it OFF then to keep safety at 100%


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I threw some extra stuff I had in there


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Awesome! Thanks so much. I'll take it the rest of the way, and upkeep shouldn't be a problem. Why do I only need to give it OFF? Why not the DW & SUN too?


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Btw, would either of you be willing to sell me 100 BER on the LM? I have a ship coming through on the way to HRT, and I want to make sure I have a full load going that way.


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Either ICA or AIC is fine.


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Sure.


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	OFF because safety can only get to 100%, and providing 1/3 upkeep (OFF is the cheapest) will provide more than enough to get to 100%


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Apparently not. I’ll sell you 100 BER when I get back to a PC. Can’t post ads for some reason. You could post an ad buying for 18,000AIC


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Ok. I'll do that. Thanks!


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	And thanks for clearing up how POPI works


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Posted!


[20-Feb-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	No problem. I’ve got a population calculator that you could use as well, but honestly with the government programs from the ADM, we won’t need more than 1 SST unless we want SCI.

[24-Feb-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Welcome CaptainRoadGuy!


[24-Feb-22 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Well, now we have TEC. And SET next week


[24-Feb-22 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	I'm usually in a position to sell some BER.


[03-Mar-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Good POPR. @deNoailles or anyone else. Anyone have a strong inclination towards running another program and want to pay the cash to do it?


[03-Mar-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If not, settlers will run automatically next week


[03-Mar-22 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi PiBoy - Thanks for your great management. How much do the programs cost to run? My inclination is toward happiness or education. I'm going to be opening up some jobs for ENG to start creating demand at that level next POPR. What do you think?


[03-Mar-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you want ENG, migration is probably the best way to go. Without a lot more technician jobs, not many will educate. Although it's spendy, 80,000 AIC for 50 ENG.


[03-Mar-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If you open up ENG jobs, you might be able to run family support programs, but I'd have to look at that in more detail later


[03-Mar-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Election starts in 6 days too, I'm not running so you're free to run.


[04-Mar-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks PiBoy - I'm not trying to move into ENG jobs fast. So no interest in spending on immigration. I recognize that few will rise out of the TECs we have. Slow and steady growth is fine by me.


[04-Mar-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Let me know what the options are for programs to boost education or happiness. I'd likely be willing to fund it.


[04-Mar-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	As for Governor, I'm happy to do it. I have my headquarters here, and I'm happy to confer with everyone here to stake out a direction together.


[04-Mar-22 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Immigration - Pioneer Immigration - Attract 500 new pioneers to the planet via targeted immigration support efforts - 10,000 ICA - Settler Immigration - Attract 200 new settlers to the planet via targeted immigration support efforts. - 25,000 ICA - Technician Immigration - Attract 100 new technicians to the planet via targeted immigration support efforts. - 50,000 ICA - Engineer Immigration - Attract 50 new engineers to the planet via targeted immigration support efforts. - 80,000 ICA - Scientist Immigration - Attract 25 new scientists to the planet via targeted immigration support efforts. - 125,000 ICA Family Support - Family Support I - Increase the natural growth of Pioneers, Settlers and Technicians by 5% for one week by offering benefits for families. - 5,049 ICA - Family Support II - Increase the natural growth of Pioneers, Settlers and Technicians by 10% for one week by offering benefits for families. - 10,099 ICA - Family Support III - Increase the natural growth of Pioneers,


[04-Mar-22 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks! I can't click the link for some reason, but it was easy enough to parse the text. :)


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I thought there were also education and happiness programs available. Maybe we need to get bigger first?


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'm happy to fund Family Support I - not sure that we need any more than that at the moment. Anyone else have an opinion?


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	@PiBoy  -  think you mentioned that there's a happiness calculator that you use? Can you point me in that direction?

[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	The question is, do you want settlers immigration next week for free? And then family support the week after?


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I can't handle the additional settlers.


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'm maxed out for the moment. Does anyone else need them?


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks for sharing the link!


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I don’t, if you’re fully employed it’s better to run no program (although you still get free settlers)


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Then no program it is, I guess. Sorry, I don't quite understand the situation. Have you already paid for the settler program for this week? I can see what I can do to employ them.


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yes, it’s not a big deal


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	its because of a bug I had to run it


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I see. Well thank you all the same. You are a generous governor. :D


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'll adjust my plans an put a few more of the new settlers to work.


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Oh wow! I just noticed that @PiBoy314 is the creator of the population calculator. You're a celebrity!


[04-Mar-22 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	😎


[04-Mar-22 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'm just the one who summarized all the knowledge PCT gathered on the population mechanics


[07-Mar-22 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi all! Can anyone sell me 100 BER to round out an outbound shipment I have coming up? Ad is on the LM. Thanks!


[07-Mar-22 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Done


[07-Mar-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks!


[08-Mar-22 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Posted one more quick buy for 10 BER if anyone can help. Thanks!


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi everybody! The election for the next governor has begun. PiBoy314 is stepping down, and so far I am the only one running to replace him. So, I would like to share a little bit about my plans if elected so you can cast an informed vote or decide to run yourself. :)


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	In addition to the great deposits of BER and H2O here, this planet benefits from a great location on the route between HRT and ANT. We're only 1 day from each CX, and we're in the only non-faction system between the two.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	There are also significant deposits of TAI, BOR, TCO and other high-tier mats within one to jumps north or south of us.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I see a lot of potential, in the very long run, for this to be a planet that supports AMLs to process these materials for both the HRT and ANT markets.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	In short, I see this planet becoming the fourth Chem hub, behind Griffonstone, Umbra, and Circe. We would also be the only one in proximity to HRT to serve its Agrichem demand for NS, DDT, etc.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	But that is all in the long, long term...


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	In the meantime, the goal is to support slow, steady, cost effective growth.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I want to ensure that we always have a sufficient PIO pop to continue resource extraction while organically growing the higher tier pops as demand arises.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	In practical terms, I plan to keep taxes for PIO production in all industries at zero.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	But I would like to implement taxes for higher tiers to fund eventual construction of a CoGC and any needed POPI along the way.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	By tier, I propose rates of 0 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100. I'm interested to know what you think. And I will never raise taxes without first consulting the group and reaching a consensus.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	For what it's worth, I suspect I'm the only one who will be subject to any of these taxes to start with. :)


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	And in any case, I will continue supplying the safety station with OFF from my own supply, regardless of the election outcome.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thank you all for your time and attention. I would be grateful for your feedback and your vote. And I hope you all have a great day!


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Cheers!


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’m fine with whatever level of taxes you choose. I’m thinking about bringing a COGC here soon-ish.


[10-Mar-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Cool! Thanks PiBoy


[17-Mar-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hey all! I have a ship landing at Griffonstone in ~1 hr. From there it will be going to Nike, ANT, and then back here. I have cargo space. Let me know if you have something to ship.


[17-Mar-22 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Nothing needed right now. I’ll pay you quite a bit to haul down a load of BER though to here


[17-Mar-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	or haul a load to ANT


[17-Mar-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Happy to do it. I'm making trips from here to HRT, ANT, and Grif pretty regularly. If you post to the LM I'll pick it up eventually.


[17-Mar-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ad up, thanks. Also ad up selling BER


[17-Mar-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thank you, sir!


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hello all! Thank you for your support during the election.


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I've updated the production fees to be 0 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 across all industries.


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Fees are now being collected in ICA, and I don't see an option to change it back to AIC. I hope this is not a problem for any of you. Let me know if I'm overlooking something.


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Let me know if any of you have any requests for a program to run this period. Population and happiness are largely in good shape for now.


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'm at your disposal if there is anything else you need.


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks!


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	It’s ICA because you formed the corporation and your company started on HOR space


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	technically you would need someone who started in AI space to form the corp to get it in AIC. But it’s not a big deal for me.


[20-Mar-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Ok. Thanks. I figured that was the case.


[24-Mar-22 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Be careful with the education programs, they can cause pioneer shortages. Maybe run a happiness program before you run more education programs.


[24-Mar-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Ok. Good to know. Fortunately we landed in good shape for PIO. Definitely agree happiness is the way to go next.


[24-Mar-22 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	A COGC here is my next big investment once I get my bases sorted out after I was away for a couple days


[24-Mar-22 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Yeah, I'm happy to pitch in on that.


[24-Mar-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Here's the thing though: What CoGC Campaign are you expecting? I employ more than half the population myself. My preference is Chem, but I'm willing to consider something else.


[24-Mar-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'd prefer resource extraction, although with my Griffonstone base filling up, I am considering moving my AML here, where I would want Chemistry.


[24-Mar-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'm excited to hear that!


[24-Mar-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I have to give up a little efficiency, but it means I can make more EPO, and don't have to ship BER super far.


[24-Mar-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Obviously there aren't ENGs here to support AMLs yet.


[24-Mar-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If I brought my AML over, I could pay for an engineer immigration program


[24-Mar-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'm happy to go with Resource Extraction or PIO campaigns in the meantime.


[24-Mar-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Resource extraction would probably be better, 15% more efficiency, and your chemistry doesn't benefit from PIO very much


[24-Mar-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I would also pay for an ENG immigration program (once the demand is there).


[24-Mar-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	^ true on the PIO


[24-Mar-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Right now I just have a PP4 here building AML building materials


[24-Mar-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	...and seeding some ENG demand


[24-Mar-22 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I have the cash to buy a COGC, just don't have the logistics to ship it in yet. If you are able to and want to ship stuff in from as far as Proxion, I can start purchasing stuff


[24-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Actually, I don't quite have the LBH yet because I produce those myself, but I'll have stuff soon.


[24-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Where the F is proxion anyway. :D


[24-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	2 hops from BEN towards MOR


[24-Mar-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	(looking it up now)


[24-Mar-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Yeah, it's a trip but I don't mind at all.


[24-Mar-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ok, I'll start contacting people / scanning CXs then...


[24-Mar-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Awesome!


[24-Mar-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Another question: do we need an infirmary at some point?


[24-Mar-22 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Probably not. We could both have full high tier bases and it wouldn't be a problem. If more people show up, however, it may change.


[24-Mar-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Ok. Good to know.


[24-Mar-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'm calling it a night here. Have a great day!


[24-Mar-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Cheers!


[24-Mar-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Have a good night!


[25-Mar-22 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Two small shipping ads from ANT on our LM for anyone who might be making the trip. Happy Friday!


[25-Mar-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	All the fabs for the COGC are on ANT now, still waiting on BWS and BMF


[29-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Oh damn!


[29-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I can ship them in in a couple days


[29-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	if you need me to


[29-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’ll probably stop at ANT before then, but I’ll keep you in the loop. If you’re flying that way anyway, let me know and I’ll put up ads


[29-Mar-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi all! I posted 3 small shipping ads from ANT to our LM in case anyone is making the trip soon. Thanks!


[15-Apr-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi all - FYI - I'm acquiring the rest of the mats for the CoGC to finish the work PiBoy started. Cheers!


[15-Apr-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	If you spot any deals on BWS, please let me know. :)


[15-Apr-22 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I have everything except the LBH


[15-Apr-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	5 BWS on Proxion, 8 BWS on BEN, 3 BWS on Griffonstone, 1 BMF on BEN, and somehow missing 1 BMF...


[15-Apr-22 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Ok. Awesome! I'll get the LBH then! I have 1 BMF I can contribute too.


[22-Apr-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Good news everyone! We now have a COGC! I would like to extend a very special you to PiBoy314 for the huge material contributions to get this built.


[22-Apr-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	The Pioneer program started automatically upon completion of the COGC. A new program will start in 7 days, and voting is open now. And the upkeep materials are fully funded for the next 10 day period.


[24-Apr-22 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi all - Can anyone spare 100 BER to round out a ship leaving for HRT soon? Ad is on LM


[24-Apr-22 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I'm also happy to take any shipments you might have going that way.

[03-May-22 04:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I'll be able to haul it starting in 2-3 days. Is that okay?


[04-May-22 03:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	If the ad is still up in a day or so, go ahead and grab it. A new player has just picked up one of my ads from ANT and I'm seeing if he'll grab more.

**Namthorn**:	allo


[04-May-22 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	been meaning to settle here for a while, kept getting sidetracked lol


[04-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Glad you could finally join us! :)


[04-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	What do you have in mind for your base here? Resource planet or will you be needing the higher tier pops?


[04-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	just extraction for now


[04-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Ok. Sounds good! Keep me posted. I'm the Governor here. I want to make sure we keep everyone's needs covered. :)


[04-May-22 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	will do


[06-May-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**deNoailles**:	Hey! Thanks for the heads up! I don't have anything going that was right now, but I'll likely have coming back from ANT later if you have room. :)


[06-May-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	@Scorus still around?


[06-May-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Yes, got distracted.


[06-May-22 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Meanwihle, I'm headed to HRT/Prom/Avalon in 30 mins if anyone has cargo...


[06-May-22 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Would anyone happen to have 2 BTA on planet? I somehow forgot them.


[06-May-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Sorry friend.


[08-May-22 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’m really bad at counting. Does anyone have 2 BSE they could spare or a ship traveling from ANT/HOR?


[08-May-22 07:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I don't have any in stock. And it will be a few days before I come back from HRT again. I'll have a ship coming from Grif soon. Do you have any BSE there?


[08-May-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I don't unfortunately. Thanks anyways though.


[09-May-22 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi all - I have a ship leaving for HRT/Prom/Avalon shortly and returning in 2 days. Post to the LM if you have anything going either way. I'm happy to make room. Cheers!


[09-May-22 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ad up shipping from HRT, thanks!


[09-May-22 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scorus**:	Tiny shipping order from ANT if anyone is coming from there soonish.


[11-May-22 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Got it. I'm leaving ANT for SE is about 8 hours in case anyone else has anything to ship from there.


[12-May-22 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’ve got some stuff. Let me post ads


[12-May-22 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Ads posted on SE, thanks!


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hi all and happy Friday!


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thank you for your continued trust in me as I serve as your Governor for another term. Here is a quick update followed by a request for your input on production fee policy going forward.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	We've grown a lot in the last two weeks as we increased from 4 to 6 bases. (Welcome @Visinvictus and @Namthorn!) And yesterday's population report looks rather healthy. After immigration it looks like we're short ~40 PIOs, but their happiness is high and we should have no trouble closing that gap this week.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	We now have two AMLs on planet processing BER at high efficiency. PiBoy314 and I co-sponsored an ENG immigration program this week to build that population. The next program starts in 4 days. Let me know if there is a program that you would like to sponsor or co-sponsor.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Likewise, let me know if you are planning a major build out that might benefit from some coordination on population management. I want to make sure we have the resource in place to support you.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	In 4 days I will also bring a Welness Center online. This will hopefully  fulfill all of our current Health and Comfort needs to keep immigration strong and avoid losses of our new ENGs.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Finally, a bit about finances. Our current production fee structure is:


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	0 PIO / 10 SET / 25 TEC / 50 ENG / 100 SCI


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Over the last four weeks, this policy has collected a total of only 4,730 ICA. Meanwhile, upkeep for a single week generally runs ~4k for Safety Station and COGC and at least 5k for Planetary Programs.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Therefore, I propose the following production fee increase that will implement a small fee for PIOs and double the fees for the other tiers:


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	10 PIO / 20 SET / 50 TEC / 100 ENG / 200 SCI


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	This is where I would like your input. There are few enough of us on this planet that we can all have an opportunity to weigh in before we make a decision.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Given the value and abundance of the resources here, I don't think that a modest production fees on extraction will have a major impact on anyone's operations. Likewise, the benefits of the COGC for more advanced activities more than offsets the higher fees on the other tiers. Together, these changes will make our income stream more sustainable going forward.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	But again, I am eager to hear your point of view. Do you support or oppose such a change?


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks for your time and attention. As always, I'm at your disposal if there's anything you need.


[13-May-22 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Cheers!


[13-May-22 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	i'd be against the pio taxes personally, it's not like we have a disruptive amount of pioneers depressing health and safety, and the CoGC doesn't benefit the majority of their jobs. If you need help with the SST, I'd be open to discuss investment in it to lessen the upkeep burden


[13-May-22 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks for your feedback @Namthorn. Does anyone else have a point of view they would like to share?


[13-May-22 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Since the taxes are in ICA, the less the better for me. I can contribute directly any amount you need in AIC


[13-May-22 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks @PiBoy314 -  Anyone else?


[13-May-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Can anyone sell me a day of DW in a pinch? Ad's on the LM. Thanks!


[13-May-22 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	got it


[13-May-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks friend!


[15-May-22 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Can anyone spare some RAT as well? :D


[15-May-22 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Thanks again @Namthorn!


[15-May-22 07:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Namthorn**:	nw, have a ship on the way with some extra RAT/DW anyway


[19-May-22 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hey all! I have a ship coming back from ANT later today. Let me know if you have any shipments from there. Happy to make room.


[19-May-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Howdy everybody! New POPR is out. It looks like everyone's needs are fully met for PIO and SET. Let me know if that's not the case for anyone.


[19-May-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	The WCE will start contributing to Health and Comfort in a couple hours when the upkeep cycle turns over. It wasn't going to have an effect in time for the last POPR, so I ran a 10% happiness program to ensure spirits.


[19-May-22 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Based on the feedback about my production fee proposal, I've decided to take a more moderate change. I plan to increase the PIO fees from 0 to 5, and I'll leave the other fees in place instead of doubling them.


[19-May-22 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	By keeping the PIO rate low, there's no risk that we'll collect more than their contribution toward the collective upkeep costs.


[19-May-22 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	(a concern raised by Namthorn)


[19-May-22 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	And by keeping the other fee levels where they are, we reduce the risk of production fees causing a currency exchange issue, since many of you primarily work in AIC.


[19-May-22 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	(a concern that PiBoy314 raised).


[19-May-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	As an additional safeguard on the currency issue, I'm going to post some sell orders to the local market to accept 1000 AIC and 1000 CIS. If anyone is running low on ICA, accept one of these and post a corresponding order in ICA  that I'll promptly accept in return to plus you up.


[19-May-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I hope that will work for everyone.


[06-Jun-22 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	3 full loads of BER available at 180/u on the LM!


[06-Jun-22 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Got it! Thanks!


[06-Jun-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I realized I had more than 1k sitting around, I might as well do something with it


[07-Jun-22 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Maybe it's time to spin up another AML. :D


[07-Jun-22 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Does anyone have any requests for Programs this week?


[09-Jun-22 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hey! Does anyone have 44 INS on short notice. Ad up on our LM. Thanks!


[20-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Howdy friends! If anyone has any excess BER in stock, I'd be happy to buy it off of you at the LM. My AMLs are running faster than my EXTs. :)


[20-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	I’ve got some. I can’t keep up with hauling my BE and SI out so I have extra currently


[20-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	What do you do with the BE? Make CBS, etc?


[20-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Yeah, CBS


[20-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	On Deimos. Also CBM and CBL as needed for ships

[20-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I've got 1 ECA here and 1 ECA on a nearby resource planet for making CBS, but that can't keep up with my AMLs either.


[20-Jun-22 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	So if you ever need more BE...


[26-Jun-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Does anyone have some spare DW?


[26-Jun-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jun-22 04:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Gotcha! No need to give it back. I have plenty.


[03-Jul-22 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**deNoailles**:	Hey again! Got another ad up for BER if anyone is interested. Cheers!

[26-Jul-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jul-22 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	Want some more? I could spare 520 more


[28-Jul-22 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jul-22 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jul-22 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	AH! Ok. I've updated the ad. Thanks so much!


[02-Aug-22 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hey everybody! After tomorrow's POPR it is going to be a very good time to build an AML or two to process your BER.


[02-Aug-22 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I will be decommissioning an EEP a few hours after the POPR. There should be enough ENGs available to fully staff 2 AMLs at that point.


[20-Aug-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	If any of y'all want cheap stuff, I have 5 ships of BER, 1 of BE, and 3 of SI on the LM for cheap


[21-Aug-22 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hey there! I'll take your BER but I already got a lot of SI and BE. Does anyone else want it? It's a great deal if anyone else wants it. If not, I'll take it too.


[31-Aug-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PiBoy314**:	deNoailles, are you still playing?


[02-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	Hey all - This announcement is really poor timing, but after taking some time off I've decided to drop out of the game.


[02-Sep-22 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**deNoailles**:	I've loaded up the POPI with all the MATs I have to get you through to a new Governor


[02-Sep-22 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rannepear**:	BER salt tastes great on any dish


[06-Jun-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	Looks like just some culture needed for more ENG. But that needs a new ART with supplies, probably DW/GL would be cheapest. Besides that, more ENG jobs would help; there's currently a bit of unemployment.


[06-Jun-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**jelutz77**:	H2O source means someone is probably making HYF food or DW here.


[06-Jun-23 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Erix_123**:	For the food, it's because I've got a surplus of NS and H2O from my other planets and I needed an additional food base. This planet happened to be in the neighborhood with plenty of pioneers available
