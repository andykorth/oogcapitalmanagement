**collot999**:	is it me, or the price of carbon is kind of expensive lately?


[25-Sep-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	demand is rising, supply hasn't been able to catch up yet


[25-Sep-21 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I see

**CapitanIncognito**:	C.NC1


[25-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That doesn't look particularly hihg


[25-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I remember C at 400-500


[25-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rugged-Yeti**:	Shhh I'm selling carbon


[25-Sep-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	If you check out the order book the lowest ask is almost 380/u


[25-Sep-21 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and there's more supply than demand


[25-Sep-21 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	of course those numbers are misleading


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Only because of THIS GUY


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Universal Reserve	271	448.99 NCN


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	much of that demand is at 250


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	And him


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ragnarok Inc	222	252.00 NCC


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Well it seems to be leveling off a bit but it's gone up quite a lot in the last couple of days


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	:D


[25-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Of course, I just bought my C in Hortus for around 250ish on average


[25-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	maybe lower actually, I think i got the first 100 or so just over MM price


[25-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Incidentally C.IC1 seems on the rise


[25-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah, C being expensive MOR suits me just fine : then I can trade back C from HRT


[25-Sep-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Eh "on the rise" but not risen!!


[25-Sep-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	It's not really expensive though


[25-Sep-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Cheapest ask there is 350


[25-Sep-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I


[25-Sep-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At various points I came up with plans to make my own C, and they've never amounted to anything because the price is never high enough


[25-Sep-21 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	welp, it got down to 300 just after I commented that, but when I did commented it, the price was around 400


[25-Sep-21 10:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	and the fact that coal changes prices so easy makes me also think on expanding towards home coal production


[25-Sep-21 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*technically its pure carbon, so likely graphite*

[26-Sep-21 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I get the impression that running WEL isnt very profitable.. because like FS or BTA, there is low demand. Is that true, or am I missing something?

Vallis: Bursting at the seams!
Hey Vallians! That time again. Since the last time we did this, we've upgraded the warehouse, added another safety station, built a wildlife park, gotten ship building up and running (with 3 ships built and a 4th in progress), and have almost finished our first infirmary. We've managed to do all of this with minimum taxes for all but the last tw...

[26-Sep-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Also, don't forget to get your bids in :-)


[26-Sep-21 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Poll filled, thanks!

**CapitanIncognito**:	MHL.NC1


[26-Sep-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	There's plenty of demand for a WEL


[26-Sep-21 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ehhh

[26-Sep-21 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	maybe i should start smelting AL here...


[26-Sep-21 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Likely


[26-Sep-21 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	You know, from the COGC Plans Vallisgov sheet, it looks like A18  P-P-P-P-M-C-P is really the best option.


[26-Sep-21 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	(Excluding poor chem)


[26-Sep-21 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Right @Capitan so you get 800 profit per unit, but the buys are bulk and not constant


[26-Sep-21 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	So -- can one really keep a WEL running full time, without it costing money in the short-term?


[26-Sep-21 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	I'm smelting AL here but it's very small scale atm


[26-Sep-21 07:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I got 8 smelters here currently, but they are mostly just popping out FE


[26-Sep-21 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	@Wingeder I'd imagine extractors wouldn't like that plan - and the delta between their efficiency and extrator's might cause supply issues


[26-Sep-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	The current problem I'm having is that the planet which I'm extracting from has a pioneer shortage so I can't fully staff my extractors


[26-Sep-21 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	:-(


[26-Sep-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	It's growing at a decent rate at least so hopefully just a short term problem


[26-Sep-21 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	#buildmoreSST


[26-Sep-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yep - the next procurement auction will be devoted to fabs for finishing the INF and another SST


[26-Sep-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	why we're stocking up this time


[26-Sep-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	guess i got to get my GF made so i can at least bid for some TUBs


[26-Sep-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yep, they're not on this one but will be on the next


[26-Sep-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Should I bother making STR or will I be outcompeted?


[26-Sep-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also BSE is so miserably worthless right now that I donated some for free, yw :D


[26-Sep-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	There are a lot of bidders for manufactured goods, but the system is designed such that no one in particular gets outcompeted


[26-Sep-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you should at least try to sell them for like 50% off. discount for the PPs


[26-Sep-21 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah I know Butane


[26-Sep-21 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Dw, I'll make it all back one day

**Wingeder**:	I dont have it either, but realized I hadnt made my monthly contribution to POPI that I'd set for myself yet


[26-Sep-21 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Hopefully I can get another PP1 next week, and then make enough profit to get 2 PP2s up, and then can get the 3D printer ready for PSL


[26-Sep-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Do you have your 12 PSL bought yet?


[26-Sep-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I have an order in with the corps


[26-Sep-21 09:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ah


[26-Sep-21 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	PSL/PSM is used quite a bit in ship manufacturing, so as that scales up I doubt you'll have a hard time selling them


[26-Sep-21 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Currently working on ship #4


[26-Sep-21 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I would like to get to the point where i mostly make a ship on my own and sell them. there is a lot of metallurgy buildings in ship building


[26-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I think ships will remain a team effort... but you could probably occupy key points in the supply chain


[26-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, agreed - it's far too much for one base to take on


[26-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	My long term goal is to have all the metallurgy buildings


[26-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	1 base o yeah.


[26-Sep-21 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	1 person. with 15 bases. maybe not


[26-Sep-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I mean... I know Twilight built one and Mad is making them, possibly on their own. But I think you end up putting down and tearing down buildings as you need them.


[26-Sep-21 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	*putting up and tearing down


[26-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I argued stubbornly for the 15 base vertical empire until the shouts of "but the shipping costs" finally got through my thick skull. You can have 15 bases, but they'll likely be integrated with other players on those planets, unless you want to go bananas with the logistics


[26-Sep-21 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	haha this.


[26-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Yeah you will need ships at that point lol


[26-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	more ships I meant


[26-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and ships be expensive


[26-Sep-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	especially FTL capable ships


[26-Sep-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah. you would need a fleet first


[26-Sep-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Yeah it's gonna be minimum of 1 mil


[26-Sep-21 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And even with a fleet, there is currently no logistics automation to speak of. Do you really want to log in 3 times a day to load up and give orders to your 10 ships?


[26-Sep-21 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I'd like modular commands... when mat n gets to qty x on base z, load and ship y units to base e


[26-Sep-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well im on my pc like 90% of the day as I dont really have a day job. I drive lyft on the weekends and Im a streamer


[26-Sep-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lol, okay you can do my shipping then


[26-Sep-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	XD


[26-Sep-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And I mean even then... a modular "create shipping contract when" would be pretty awesome. The universe still has plenty of unused capacity


[26-Sep-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Unused shipping capacity


[26-Sep-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Mhm, agreed


[26-Sep-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	If only shipping accept was TRIAL capable


[26-Sep-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Then EVERYBODY would be shipping hehehe


[26-Sep-21 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I think with LM, the only place STL GEN really works is if you have 2+ bases in the system


[26-Sep-21 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also, GOTTA GIT THOSE AFABS so we can make shipyards in --... oh.. not very many systems worth two bases..


[26-Sep-21 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	lol


[26-Sep-21 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	The Tungsten must floW


[26-Sep-21 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Who wants to make a shipyard? There's a free one on Pallada


[26-Sep-21 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Just setup a dealership base there with LM and STO. Wayyyy cheaper


[27-Sep-21 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Actually a pretty interesting idea since it's possible to post ads with just a warehouse now :D


[27-Sep-21 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	you know, you've got my wheels spinning haha


[27-Sep-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I think you have to have a base to contribute to a project?


[27-Sep-21 12:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but since you can just tear down a CMK for full refund, maybe that's not too bad


[27-Sep-21 12:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Yeah someone could set up the warehouse then demo the base


[27-Sep-21 01:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Sure - I'll look into making this happen here soon - awesome idea


[27-Sep-21 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	only downside I can see is STO fees/size - might have to upgrade the STO a couple of times, and pay the default fees


[27-Sep-21 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	You mean the WAR right? lol True, I don't think we'll be able to change the fees either and iirc it's 1k/w by default


[27-Sep-21 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, WAR - sorry :D


[27-Sep-21 01:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, 1k/unit/wk


[27-Sep-21 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	but I'd think 1,000 t worth of space would be fine to start with


[27-Sep-21 01:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and 2k/week isn't too bad, I guess


[27-Sep-21 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	not for the people that would be using it, at least


[27-Sep-21 01:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Yep you'd need at least 768m3 of space for one of the basic STL ship


[27-Sep-21 01:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	The plates / BRS are the worst at 430 and 200


[27-Sep-21 02:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	ooh, so you'd need a higher level warehouse too then


[27-Sep-21 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, level 3 - i'll put together a BOM tomorrow so we can see what the price tag looks like

[27-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	If anybody else got some I'd love to buy more


[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Well with how much C we go though its not feasible to get all our C from HOR. Local suppliers are key.


[27-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	My PP1s production chain is all wonky and messily staggered


[27-Sep-21 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ah, yeah true.


[27-Sep-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	But then atleast I can cash out of ICA, just by trading back C


[27-Sep-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Sep-21 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	there is no relocation per se. you can build a new base, then move your HQ and then remove the old one


[28-Sep-21 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	base with HQ cannot be removed, and you loose the CMK of your very first base - for other bases you will get CM materials back

[01-Oct-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if/when you do get pro/basic you would have no issues selling FEO locally


[01-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	If you can balance out your smelters and extractors to be able to smelt it all it will be much more profitable for you, but if you do need to dump some ore for space then the LM is great for it


[01-Oct-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Once you're pro of course


[01-Oct-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh, I realized that the election started so..


[01-Oct-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Make your choice matter, by voting for a governor who puts your tax towards the welfare of the people! StelioKontos builds infrastructure to help everyone, by giving back to the people of Vallis with government-sponsored contracts, leading Vallis into a utopia.


[01-Oct-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Anyone have a ship with 218t/191m3 of space coming from MOR anytime soon?


[01-Oct-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I have a ship with a whole bunch of space coming from HRT to Vallis soon


[01-Oct-21 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Dang, I already bought the goods at MOR or I probably would have taken you up on that

**Wingeder**:	𝑾𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒆𝒅 𝑬𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒂𝒗𝒐𝒓 shipping HRT > Vallis : departure.. ~1 day from now(DONT COUNT ME ON IT) hours 400t/400cm available. Fuel is expensive right now, 6ncc/t thank you. P.s. estimated delivery 1d 14hr after departure.


[01-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'm gonna ship some EPO from Prom to the HRT cx (no rush at all) - if it happens to arrive quickly I could have you bring it back for me


[01-Oct-21 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	but don't wait on me


[01-Oct-21 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Awesome!


[01-Oct-21 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I will be here until my C gets filled


[01-Oct-21 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Apparently getting 50k in profit means I can now get over 120 C


[01-Oct-21 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	XD


[01-Oct-21 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	EPO?


[01-Oct-21 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Must have.. all :)


[01-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	lol


[01-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	lol I need at least some of it- been starved on EPO since.. you know xD


[01-Oct-21 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	but pretty sure I member how to share


[01-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So... is CL a good thing to get into?


[01-Oct-21 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	it is used in a few goodies.


[01-Oct-21 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but NA isnt in high demand so it may fall to the MM


[01-Oct-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	THF


[01-Oct-21 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	My plan is to get my 3rd base on Circe, and then make EPO/THF


[01-Oct-21 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess my biggest issue is it doesn't look very profitable to make a base dedicated to CL production even at current prices


[01-Oct-21 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but without a steady supply of CL, some of my other plans... don't work


[01-Oct-21 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh yeah, even with 430k put into Lfabs and stuff, rains planner says it only pops out like 14k per day


[01-Oct-21 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	So not as good as it could be, but.. still very much necessary for atleast one person to be doing it.


[01-Oct-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Capitan!!!! The least you could do is have the honor to not pennybid me!


[01-Oct-21 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Which thing are we talking about now?


[01-Oct-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Carbon


[01-Oct-21 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	See? Atleast SmartDog bids a full dollar over me! C.IC1


[01-Oct-21 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Nobody wants to sell you carbon at that price


[01-Oct-21 09:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You'll just catch it if it falls and then you'll be stuck with it


[01-Oct-21 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	My bid is actually at 270


[01-Oct-21 09:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	It needs to be cheaper then MOR or its not worth the extra FF


[01-Oct-21 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	The MOR ave is 360... you could buy... yeah not quite 300


[01-Oct-21 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well good luck to you. Hope you get your ship back lol


[01-Oct-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Oct-21 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Which LM?


[01-Oct-21 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	HRT


[01-Oct-21 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh its because it takes a 1.5 days to get back, and I'm still gonna be here until my C fills


[01-Oct-21 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	oh gotcha - no need to extend then, for sure


[01-Oct-21 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

Vallis: Bursting at the seams!
Hey Vallians! That time again. Since the last time we did this, we've upgraded the warehouse, added another safety station, built a wildlife park, gotten ship building up and running (with 3 ships built and a 4th in progress), and have almost finished our first infirmary. We've managed to do all of this with minimum taxes for all but the last tw...

[02-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SR5473**:	Heck yeah


[02-Oct-21 08:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	We are also not running out of PIO unlike Montem


[02-Oct-21 08:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	There's something to be said for that


[02-Oct-21 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Wow our settler unemployment dropped a fair bit, thats good..


[02-Oct-21 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Hopefully the PBH will fill up ENG happiness before it drops below 50... whew dangerously close


[02-Oct-21 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I guess prox has an easier time meeting pop needs, because of its half sized PIO count..


[02-Oct-21 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	52% is the highest its been, haha - it's on an upward trend :-)   (sorry, just getting back from dinner)


[02-Oct-21 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Montem has an insane number of Set/Tec still, and Phobos is finally catching up with us in ENG


[02-Oct-21 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also Vallis ranks 4th in Tec now, with Mont, Prom, and Phobos in that order.


[02-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Surprisingly, relative to PIO size, Phobos also has the highest SET ratio


[02-Oct-21 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Vallis takes 3rd in pure numbers of Set though, with Montem actually surpassing Prom's brute force migration.


[02-Oct-21 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Vallis also takes third in PIO now, rising quickly through the ranks, with only 17k left to cover before Montem is overtaken. On other news, Montem is actually losing Settlers to reverse migration now.. ouch..

**SR5473**:	Rubicate also needs to upgrade SST to level 5 to help its situation


[02-Oct-21 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	LM ads up for that, and also a buy for FE, desperately in need.


[02-Oct-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	He also needs to activate the SST's they do have


[02-Oct-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah happiness under 50 means you either screwed up or got too much new-player-influx for the POPI to handle


[02-Oct-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Wait.. HE HASNT ACTIVATED IT?


[02-Oct-21 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	#oof


[02-Oct-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Only 1 is active and he has 3

**SR5473**:	Yep that is #oof


[02-Oct-21 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	oh no - is he aware? I can reach out if not


[02-Oct-21 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I think he is now cause it looks like he somewhat filled the upkeep


[02-Oct-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I don't know how that works though


[02-Oct-21 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	So you might need to reach out


[02-Oct-21 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah I think he was trying to play it conservatively to keep taxes low and it bit him in the butt


[02-Oct-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	those extra SST's won't activate till the next PoPR


[02-Oct-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	right - I wish it activated when you applied the changes instead


[02-Oct-21 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Oct-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah, we are hitting the opposite end of the system era


[03-Oct-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	cant wait till we are close again so i can bulk up and mm FEO


[03-Oct-21 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	It is starting to get really bad


[03-Oct-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Can I buy your FEO


[03-Oct-21 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	when its on the complete opposite end of the system I just say screw it and jump to other systems and sell there.


[03-Oct-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	sorry, you miss understood, I BUY FEO at mm, then ship it here.


[03-Oct-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I am gonna expand my SME


[03-Oct-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Oh lol


[03-Oct-21 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I burn around 100 FEO a day XD


[03-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thats more than a single shipload


[03-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	Is there a way to extract the mass/velocity/radius of the orbital bodies. I'd love to make a community tool that calculates optimum dates/times for intra-system travel


[03-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	that would be cool


[03-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Mine is like 90ish


[03-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	then we could really have scheduled weekly/bi-weekly/monthly runs, optimise fuel costs


[03-Oct-21 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I got 8 smelters with 4 experts, 10h36m cook time XD


[03-Oct-21 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Anyone need shipping to Moria Station 400t empty


[03-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	what's the going rate for shipping Vallis-Moria these days?


[03-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	@collot999 is that a price error


[03-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	is it still 3nnc/max


[03-Oct-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	in what order?


[03-Oct-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	32 BDE for 10000


[03-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	....that cant be right?


[03-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I don't anyone can make a profit for that price lol


[03-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	it was a resource error


[03-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	lol


[03-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I was triying to sell 32 FE


[03-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thats a bit more valid


[03-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I was like, I mean Ill take it if thats a legit sell.....but I feel like its not


[03-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	so for 22.5t of cargo to Vallis the rate would be like 67.5NCC if I'm understanding the 3NCC/max properly?


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I normally round it up to 70 but yeah


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Yes


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	plus the cost of the posting fee (53 ncc here)


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	does that 53 go to stelio? or is it a sink?


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Stellio,


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	fo


[03-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	goes to stelio


[03-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	for autions and what not


[03-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	oh good, in that case I won't factor in the posting fee, stelio can take my money any time


[03-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	because he is a good lead


[03-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	big fan


[03-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its a reinvestment in the planet


[03-Oct-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	thanks for the warning SR5473


[03-Oct-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	no worries it also got me some FE


[03-Oct-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	somehow I mixed up the orders, as I wanted to sell 4 BDE and 32 FE lol


[03-Oct-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	How often do you sell FE


[03-Oct-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	me? whenever somone asks for some/whenever im nearing broke lvls/when I find an amazing deal to sell it.


[03-Oct-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Sure


[03-Oct-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I am gonna keep buying cause the price is pretty decent right now


[03-Oct-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	now that I have 4 smelters, I can produce 32 FE/day


[03-Oct-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Nice


[03-Oct-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	it is pretty low here. but it always is.


[03-Oct-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	once in a while you can find it profitable to ship it to other CXs.


[03-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Yeah I don't really wanna expand my SME cause I don't have a lot of space


[03-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I remember a while back i sold a ship full of FE to Benten for 800+ppu


[03-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	lol


[03-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	but ATM I'm out of carbon and flux, so I'm selling FEO as I want to see how much I have left after buing supplies for my colony and selling stuff from misscalculating how much I needed for building


[03-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	ok cool


[03-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Carbon does feel like its in a bit of a pinch right now


[03-Oct-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	ooof, I am running out of C my self. only got about a days supply left


[03-Oct-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	same x)


[03-Oct-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	one reason why i started to cook a little more STL.


[03-Oct-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but so much O


[03-Oct-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	indeed. but now that the market has recovered. its not really worth it to make STL for under 700 for me


[03-Oct-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	@SR5473 I put up a shipping ad on LM for moria


[03-Oct-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	right now, carbon alone is like 1/3 of the price of each FE


[03-Oct-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	got it


[03-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well it should be around 1/4th, means your not using your flx XD. but yeah its climbing


[03-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I'd say, flx is also quite expensive at the moment


[03-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	Carbon + flux is also 1/3 of the price


[03-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	a bit more I'd say


[03-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but its always better to use FLX, until the cost of flux is greater than the cost of FE.


[03-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	(or AL if your using that)


[03-Oct-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	FLX shortage mostly cause of Montem


[03-Oct-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I do use FLX, but I'm also out of it XD


[03-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Ok I am leaving for the CX


[03-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I should have a batch coming in from Montem soon


[03-Oct-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	If I'm correct, the soil fertility of this planet is -50%, no?


[03-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	-10.8%


[03-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	FIO updated now to show the exact efficiency loss/gain


[03-Oct-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	breath the black air


[03-Oct-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	one reason why us dwarfs grow such wonderful facial hair, natural filters.


[03-Oct-21 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	makes sense XD


[03-Oct-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	btw, how can I check the exact fertility?


[03-Oct-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	exact? using FIO?


[03-Oct-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if you want to know some good farm planets we can just tell you as well XD. there are a few main ones that are already fairly established so you can grow very quickly there


[03-Oct-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I was debating on settling on Veredant, extract h2o and O and maybe set up a fermentor there so I can make my own dwarven ales for everyone


[03-Oct-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I where planing more on a local production of carbon to supply my smelters


[03-Oct-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	were*


[03-Oct-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the other option is to build a HYF base and burn HCP


[03-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats something I've been toying with lately


[03-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but that is also not the most efficient way either. the water here is terrible. sorry we ruined the water too with our mining and smelting XD


[03-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah water has to be trucked in for sure


[03-Oct-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	im not sure which would be better, trucking in HCP or H2O, but either way your trucking in something.


[03-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	yea, hyf here isn't worth, a FRM won't work?


[03-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its better to just ship that stuff in


[03-Oct-21 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	anyone got some BBH or BDE lying around?


[03-Oct-21 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	Always


[03-Oct-21 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	my man


[03-Oct-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	HEY


[03-Oct-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I need to sell BBH/BDE


[03-Oct-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Do you still need more?


[03-Oct-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	sorry wingeder, we did the trade a few minutes ago


[03-Oct-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Awww


[03-Oct-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh well.


[03-Oct-21 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I'll put up a sell anyways, probably a decent idea.


[03-Oct-21 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'll be prepping the next auction request later tonight, so you should be able to see a list of materials soon


[03-Oct-21 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	aiming for at least 1 SST, INF, CoGC/ minimal PBH upkeep


[03-Oct-21 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Hey everyone! Based on the results from the recent infrastructure role, I'm setting the production fees to 30 ncc in order to pay for the PBH, INF, 2x SST, and continue running auctions for upkeep! I'll minimize the production fees to what we need to stay afloat once we're finished.


[03-Oct-21 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	-throws tea into harbor-


[03-Oct-21 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**discern**:	I feel like taxes are going up almost everywhere, yet many of these projects only really benefit the wealthy who use techs and up :(


[03-Oct-21 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	That's not really true - there are a lot of people looking forward to teching up, and it also helps the extractors, smelters, and constructors


[03-Oct-21 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	a perfect example of this would be the increase in FE/O expansion over the past month


[03-Oct-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	we're on track to be able to fix our shipping woes in a few months as well with the addition of FTL-capable ships.


[03-Oct-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I've also dropped around 600k in funds to accelerate the PBH without affecting Vallis by the acceleration.


[03-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	how does it help people doing FE/FEO?


[03-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	ships require a metric ton of FE


[03-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	which requires expansion in all sectors


[03-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I assumed the FE boom was because of UTS


[03-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	partly, yes


[03-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	also, shipping woes are really only a rich player thing :P


[03-Oct-21 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'd say not, if you have been following chat over the past couple of weeks.


[03-Oct-21 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	FTL-capable and High volume/tonnage, I should have been more specific


[03-Oct-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	depends on your definition of rich


[03-Oct-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Not to be snarky, but I do find it mildly entertaining that we only hear from you when you're talking about taxes :D


[03-Oct-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I don't like paying more taxes!


[03-Oct-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	did you participate in the "I spammed way too much" infrastructure poll?


[03-Oct-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Would you mind answering my original question Stelio?


[03-Oct-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I actually did participate in the poll


[03-Oct-21 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	it's fully democratic :-)


[03-Oct-21 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	and voted for no tax increase


[03-Oct-21 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	only 1 person out of 20 voted no on increasing, and 30 ncc passed with 60+%


[03-Oct-21 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	sec, Ja - need to catch up


[03-Oct-21 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Np


[03-Oct-21 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	can we get a breakdown by corp on those votes


[03-Oct-21 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	No, they're anonymous - I only posted it here though, and we have 40+ people on Vallis in SNF


[03-Oct-21 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	So as far as timelines, the PBH is finished and I fronted all of the funds for it


[03-Oct-21 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	The order of priority is thus:  1) continue to support procurement auctions 2) expand SST/INF as necessary 3) pay back funds for the PBH


[03-Oct-21 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	the timeline largely depends on how quickly that can be accomplished


[03-Oct-21 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	what percentage of the costs are upkeep vs. paying back capital expenditure?


[03-Oct-21 08:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	approximately


[03-Oct-21 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Won't really work like that - sort of 'whatever is left over after 1) and 2)'


[03-Oct-21 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	there's no real timeline to paying them back - sooner is better of course, but the rest takes priority


[03-Oct-21 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	ok I can actually answer my own question


[03-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	tax revenue is ~250k pre-increase, 10-day upkeep is ~270k


[03-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and on the note of minimum taxes - that's not really a feasible option anymore. Current upkeep for just SST + CoGC far outweighs minimum taxes


[03-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	yeah but it's a catchy slogan :P


[03-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	(honestly 15 would be the number most likely)


[03-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	all's fair in love and politics


[03-Oct-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'd argue honesty is the better policy, but to each their own.


[03-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	anyways, assuming tax revenue actually doubles, that means it's probably going about 50/50 to upkeep vs payback


[03-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	maybe a little more towards upkeep since there's a new building


[03-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	not all of the revenue comes from production fees


[03-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	going from 10 to 15 (an increase of 50%) worked out to around a 30% overall increase


[03-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	eh I just wanted an estimate


[03-Oct-21 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	as such, I'm expecting somewhere around a 60% increase overall


[03-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	there are other variables, however - how many INF, SST, etc - cost of upkeep, market shifts, etc


[03-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	with 60% up, that would be an extra 150k per week


[03-Oct-21 08:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	around that, yeah.


[03-Oct-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	so best-case the building is paid for in ~4 weeks, worst case it might be a few months


[03-Oct-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	On that scale, yes - I don't expect it to take longer than two months


[03-Oct-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	but where we move forward from PBH is also up to everyone


[03-Oct-21 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	cool, so best guess is 1-2 months of excruciating tax burden and pain :P


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	-throws more tea into harbor-


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	does vallis even have a harbor


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	can we build one


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	that's not fair - it has a negligible impact on profit margins and you know it


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	also, the tea analogy is inaccurate as well


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I do, I'm being overly dramatic for fun haha


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	where is the lack of representation?


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	fair enough haha


[03-Oct-21 08:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	The 30 prod fees is a bit rough for players in my position. For brand new players you don't really have enough lines up and running for it to hit you too hard, however I'm a couple weeks in at the phase where I have 10 lines up but I don't have a hugely consistent income being generated so it does make it a bit tense if items don't sell for a day or two. I do understand that it was a vote though so it is what it is


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	@Japrosperous it was the amount that was voted on


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I didn't decide it myself.


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Guys can I just point out that the only people with enough production buildings running, to warrant the taxes taking a noticeable amount of their profit, are the people going into Tecs and higher up stuff.


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Yeah, that's what I mentioned in my last line there


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Diokana**:	i saw that poll and had no idea what anything did so i didn't vote


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh, discern, blame me: I voted for the 30ncc taxes


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	it would be really nice if taxes could be different based on the different worker tiers


[03-Oct-21 08:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	but alas they cannot


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Bc I looked at FIN, and it doesnt even... its just... SO SMALL an amount of my profit


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	It would be nice. I'm at 10 prod buildings but only pioneers in the workforce


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	It is unfortunately a significant amount of my profit Wing lol


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also I agree Stelio, honesty is the best policy.


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	We could set different fees for different industries - might complicate things a bit


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	wasn't there a program where Stelio was selling discounted consumables for new players?


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Sure discern, we can make a harbor -- it costs a megaton of Afabs


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	right now, every industry is set to 30 ncc. Warehouse fees and LM fees are still at minimum


[03-Oct-21 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	PAY UP


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I'll pay 30 ncc per building per day, how's that sound


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yes, I have been @discern (as I've been able)


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Although I think a huge pain point atm for metallurgists is the price of carbon, that's putting a lot of pressure on the newer players with smelters


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	@Japrosperous you can probably work some things out with Stelio if you run too low on cash


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	DW/RAT demand has skyrocketed, so it's been a bit of an issue for the past week


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I think all industries should have the same fees, as fees are listed on the starter-world-display-page when starting your company.


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	On the note of C prices


[03-Oct-21 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	DW is in a good spot tbh


[03-Oct-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'm trying to fix this haha - bit of a production line problem


[03-Oct-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	oh oof C prices have gone up since I last checked


[03-Oct-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	We've recently expanded burnable output on Verdant by quite a bit


[03-Oct-21 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also we can control which industries are encouraged by CoGC program, rather then taxes.


[03-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also I'm dumping C from Hortus


[03-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Your welcome people who'


[03-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*who's ads I've accepted


[03-Oct-21 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	Wingeder I'm surprised you're not officially in SNF at this point lol


[03-Oct-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I'm out now of what I can sell though, 120 C gets bought fast here.


[03-Oct-21 08:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Eh I dont have discord, and until I get BASIC I wont be able to do anything


[03-Oct-21 08:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	I appreciate all the information being shared here, very helpful for understanding what all is going on as a newer player


[03-Oct-21 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	:) it takes quite some time to understand the game, took me a while to know how to do anything but farm as well

**Wingeder**:	P.s. I'm making an online store selling plants, so once it's ready, buy one so I can afford buying true PRO .-.


[03-Oct-21 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I need more plants in the house - sure.


[03-Oct-21 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	xD


[03-Oct-21 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Awesome! lol


[03-Oct-21 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	@japrosperous if that's the first time you've seen it, check out the Vallis_Bidding tab as well - has links to discord where you can get more information about the government auction I run


[03-Oct-21 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also while I'm fine supplying stuff to anybody who wants it, as long as the price is atleast somewhat profitable, I prefer getting my metals crafted by professional dwarves, so that would just leave LST.


[03-Oct-21 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I tried to only employ dwarves for my smelters but got hit with a nasty discrimination lawsuit for it


[03-Oct-21 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	thankfully we haven't educated any lawyers on vallis so it went nowhere


[03-Oct-21 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	You probably lost the suit because the lawyers were all scummy wine drinking tree hugging elves!


[03-Oct-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	rolf


[03-Oct-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I dont employ them myself, just by the metal from a guy who does


[03-Oct-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*dont sue me please*


[03-Oct-21 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	listed more COF


[04-Oct-21 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	People of Vallis, Carbon is sky high in cost, while FE is dropping lower and lower, what's going on?!


[04-Oct-21 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Yeah it's wild. At least Flux has started to come down again


[04-Oct-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	if you are a heavy FE producer, please consider making STL for a while, it's FE + O which you should already ahve


[04-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	There's a major C shortage, and at least one (afaik) of our  large C producers has been AFK for a week or so


[04-Oct-21 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	scrambling to correct it - shouldn't last too much longer


[04-Oct-21 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Appreciate you working on that Stelio


[04-Oct-21 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	problem with STL is it doesnt sell as fast. and burns a lot of O, If i had a good supply of O and a regular buyer I would love to make STL in mass


[04-Oct-21 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**A_Tasty_Pastry**:	yes, I have looked into making STL as well, and it is very slow moving


[04-Oct-21 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I do make some, but not a bunch, I personally only need to make 1 batch a day. to keep up. Normally I do 4-1 for my prod queues


[04-Oct-21 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but my O is getting too low for that currently


[04-Oct-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	if only there was a supply of oxygen that could, I dunno, be collected from the atmosphere or something


[04-Oct-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	:)


[04-Oct-21 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	it seems that people are scrambling to throw down more C production, I imagine it'll be back to normal in a few weeks; probably just didn't keep up with the pace of people adding SMEs


[04-Oct-21 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	I realize I basically said the exact same thing as Stelio, I mean it's not just SNF doing it so can expect the market to stabilize


[04-Oct-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh P.s. I am making trips to HRT once a week, and dumping C back here, so that should help.. a bit..


[04-Oct-21 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	C.IC1


[04-Oct-21 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	C.NC1


[04-Oct-21 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**discern**:	hmm that doesn't indicate the true spread, the asks in moria are at like 450


[04-Oct-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Mhm


[04-Oct-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	So not *that* cheap, but its still much cheaper.


[04-Oct-21 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Noice, now if I chop my arm off I will be able to do something about it, not just scream in pain.


[04-Oct-21 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Oct-21 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	how fast will it burn through those?


[04-Oct-21 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	POPID p-OT-580c t-INF


[04-Oct-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	it just says contribution 1 on each..... I think it would be more than that? as the STR is the same but the reserves are 300 and 30 respectivly


[04-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	300 every 30 days (10/day) for TUB/OFF, 30 every 30 days for STR (1/day)


[04-Oct-21 07:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	depending on funding, I may not stock up fully on this - might just cover 15 days or so - we'll see


[04-Oct-21 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	so the reserve is a 30 day supply basicly


[04-Oct-21 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I cant make them right now anyway, I was just currious for building purposes.


[04-Oct-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, 30 day reserve - same for all PI, which is nice

[05-Oct-21 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Oct-21 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah,, it took nearly 3 months for me due to some mess ups i decided to power through, but I started ramping up pretty quickly.


[05-Oct-21 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	ooof, making food here? rough.


[05-Oct-21 12:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	we kind of burned out the soil and the water. very poor rates.


[05-Oct-21 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	too much smelting


[05-Oct-21 12:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but if its working for you who am i to judge


[05-Oct-21 12:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	as a TRIAL user, I don't really have the benefits of being able to utilise local markets, so going vertical and fully self-sufficient was the best option for me


[05-Oct-21 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	but yeah the water is awful, tried to extract some but then saw that I lost money from the upkeep and the taxes and instantly destroyed it haha

[05-Oct-21 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	up for auction: over 150 bfabs, cogc upkeep, and a bit of TUB + SP to get the INF/PBH rolling


[05-Oct-21 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	POPR update for everyone - since we got the 3rd SST and INF up and running prior to this POPR, we'll get the full effect from both next week, rather than having to wait until the next POPR!


[05-Oct-21 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	That means our focus right now, from a government finance perspective, is to fill up the upkeep and pay back the funds for the PBH. Great news all around.


[05-Oct-21 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	As far as PBH upkeep goes, we're going to stick with SP/OFF for now (giving us 33% efficiency) while we do some cost-benefit analysis on the remaining items. It's worth noting that IDC/EDC are a couple of months out

[05-Oct-21 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	MHP might not be hard. I imagine someone out there has a an EDM with way too much spare capacity


[05-Oct-21 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At least I hope someone still has one


[05-Oct-21 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yeah, I'll try including a few MHP in the next auction, just to see how available it is (I think we have at least 1 producer in SNF)


[06-Oct-21 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and yeah, need to figure out whether AAR is worth it right now given the cost

[06-Oct-21 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Poor butane


[06-Oct-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	aLRIGHT!! POPR is in, its time for your breakdown by Universal Trend Radio, your source for all things population


[06-Oct-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Prox is getting too big for its own good and now has 41 happiness on settlers, making it the most negative-migrationy of the top plants, but luckly for us, Vallis can say that we've got the best place to live, if you're a settler.


[06-Oct-21 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Eng still enjoy Prox wayyyy more, and indeed 4, I repeat, FOUR!!! Engineers have now spawned for the first time ever in a popr, this week on prox, giving them 20 FULL ENGINEERS!!


[06-Oct-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Meanwhile with our happiness decrease to only 52.2% on Eng we are falling far behind, with 2 instead of the usual 3 guys being inspired to read more, giving us a nice round 16 Eng, the same has Phobos, who despite having 51.9% happiness for Eng, got the usual 3 more.


[06-Oct-21 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Moving on to the rest of the universe, Promitor is still brute forcing its way into 4th spot, as usual, despite their saddening 34.8% happiness.. I guess 11 isnt enough for reverse migration? Also Prom is trying to brute force its settlers, and tec counts past Montem, and is failing.


[06-Oct-21 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Actually everything is failing to brute force montem's SET and TEC, with their staggering 137 migration into TEC this week, and 21k total settlers.


[06-Oct-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	In the less extreme parts of the world, Prom, Prox, Phobos (thats alot of 'P's), and Vallis, are having a small race on technicians, with all having just over 1k tec, for Vallis/Prox its even the first time ever.


[06-Oct-21 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I love being a radio show host :D


[06-Oct-21 10:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Tune in next week to SM 58.03, for your report on all things population


[06-Oct-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Wingeder, thank you! Slight update - happiness did not decrease for ENG - it's just rising slowly (hasn't ever decreased I don't think)


[06-Oct-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Also, I expect technician population to start booming here soon - we should reach 75%+ happiness by next POPR with the latest POPR additions

[06-Oct-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Oct-21 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	soo, I have been thinking on setting up a base in OT-580d, but I dobut that it is a good idea :/


[06-Oct-21 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	yeah.. dont bother..


[06-Oct-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Just.. we just need 1 guy there, and then have them make a LM/warehouse.


[06-Oct-21 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	If you want TIO, grab XG-326a


[06-Oct-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If you want TIO, just buy it


[06-Oct-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	someone's selling it to MM


[06-Oct-21 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	TIO.NC1


[06-Oct-21 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Thats the guy who's on XG-326a


[06-Oct-21 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	He just dumps TIO ever couple days


[06-Oct-21 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	welp, I'm a mining company, so I do want to increase the resources I do sell


[06-Oct-21 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	MG, TIO, BER, all good things to mine, coming up.


[06-Oct-21 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	welp, I'm still researching, as I'll take a while to gather enought resources to start a new base, if I don't decide to increase my FE production


[06-Oct-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Pretty sure those are all oversupplied


[06-Oct-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I know ALO.NC1 doesn't seem as sexy


[06-Oct-21 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I.. am pretty sure they arent, or we would have W already


[06-Oct-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but lfabs need AL and ships need tons of it


[06-Oct-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The bottleneck on BER is AMLs


[06-Oct-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah ALO is a nice thing to mine, everybody needs it eventually.


[06-Oct-21 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	TIO is at MM


[06-Oct-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean ALO.NC1 TIO.NC1


[06-Oct-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Somebody needa make Afabs


[06-Oct-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and ALO is lighter


[06-Oct-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean do you have a spare 400-500k for an AML?


[06-Oct-21 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Well its just the afabs that are expensive


[06-Oct-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	And in 5 month time, yes, I most certinately will have a spare 500k


[06-Oct-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean... sure, but they're really expensive


[06-Oct-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	In 5 months any base you build today will need to be fully repaired


[06-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	... like my Prism base whose state I just noticed and suddenly all my money disappeared


[06-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oof, good point.


[06-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the ship carrying repair materials has 64 BSEs on it :(


[06-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Most of which I bought


[06-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	More CLR, more LAB, more Chlorine, MOAR LABBBBBBBB


[06-Oct-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I just settled Kiruna to make CL


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	EPO.NC1


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ew kiruna


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Circe better :D


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	that needs to come down a bit before rfabs can be cheaper


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	- The guy settling Circe in 3 months


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	although, PP3 time is kind of cheap now with INS.NC1


[06-Oct-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Mhm


[06-Oct-21 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Circe has -1302 settlers


[06-Oct-21 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah, and once I get my base there running, I intend to make enough Rfabs to boost POPI there and here into the sky


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	The only thing I need TEC for there, is the LAB for NA > THF


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm already short settlers and techs on multiple worlds :(


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	actually, I'm short pioneers on TO-392d


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	POL and CHP run on Set, which will be increased by the time I make my base there


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so I'm short every type of worker on at least one world


[06-Oct-21 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oof


[06-Oct-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm... there's a part of me that wishes I'd never settled Prism


[06-Oct-21 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but now I have 4 manufacturing experts there


[06-Oct-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but really that manufacturing could be anywhere


[06-Oct-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Honestly, I feel like Prism should get an Electronics CoGC and just be the CLR hub


[06-Oct-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Because the nearest spot out from there is Manifold


[06-Oct-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Manifold?


[06-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	PLI EL-179b


[06-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, Prism is very short on Techs


[06-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	CUO, LIO


[06-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Hmm... get some POPR up then.


[06-Oct-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Hmm...


[06-Oct-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	LIO isn't super great without a nearby source of HAL


[06-Oct-21 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and that's not a problem my logistics can solve :(


[06-Oct-21 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Hmm, good point.


[06-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I nearly settled a LIO world near Verdant, but then I remembered that my outbound ships are always full of LST and N for the NS


[06-Oct-21 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and there's not a good tier 1 planet between here and there that I could use to make it


[06-Oct-21 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yep, basically.


[06-Oct-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I suppose I could make NS somewhere here then ship it out to Verdant


[06-Oct-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I buy the N along the wa

[08-Oct-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alxder**:	I've got 2 days left of PRO, I want to donate all I have to make Vallis grow though, it's been a welcoming planet!


[08-Oct-21 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alxder**:	@StelioKontos where should I put my mats, I've got a bunch of BBH, C and all kinds of consumables


[08-Oct-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	@alxder hey, sorry for the delay!


[08-Oct-21 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I can take those and provide super low cost materials to new players - thank you very much :-)


[08-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'll need to put together a sheet to keep track of it, busy with work for a few more hours


[08-Oct-21 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	are you on discord? message me there if so, in here if not - hard for me to check COM


[08-Oct-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	is it just me, or is becoming harder to sell FE here?


[08-Oct-21 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	On that note, are you sure you don't want to hold on to them, in the case you decided to come back at a later date?


[08-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yeah, supply is gonna go up a bit due to the recent nerfs on UTS


[08-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	don't think it's worth a correction quite yet, but keeping an eye on it


[08-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	what is the UTS?


[08-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	6 FE + 2 SFK = 1 UTS


[08-Oct-21 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	open up a new buffer and type MAT UTS


[08-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	it's mainly used in drones (and a bit for building art workshops), but its popular right now due to the MM


[08-Oct-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	but as FE prices fall, demand will rise, as it makes the UTS MM price a bit more lucrative


[08-Oct-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	ok, thanks


[08-Oct-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**alxder**:	@StelioKontos I'll message you on Discord but setting up low cost materials for new players sounds like a good use for my mats


[08-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**alxder**:	Ok, I set up the sheet, there should be a good 90 BBH, 70 BSE, 30 BDE, 60 C and a whole bunch of other random stuff that'll be set up as a starter package for new players :)


[08-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	Does anyone regularly bring in RAT/DW to sell on the LM? Looking for a local supplier


[08-Oct-21 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I bring in to CX, but not typically to planet. I wouldn't be against it if I had enough demand for it


[08-Oct-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I go through them at a decent clip (over 40 each a day). I would probably get in on some of that


[08-Oct-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	more soon since im getting ready for another expansion

[08-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I tend to put ads up on the LM 2 days before I run out, I have one up for 200 DW right now

**Wingeder**:	P.s. how is BSE cheaper then BTA


[09-Oct-21 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	I buy my H off the CX and it has generally been in the 50-60 range.


[09-Oct-21 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	As for BSE being cheaper than BTA, PE prices spiked for a bit, and the market is efficient only in the longer term =)


[09-Oct-21 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Hmm, good point.


[09-Oct-21 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also the BSE market is more reliable


[09-Oct-21 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Make 100 BSE and 100 BTA, and I can tell you which you will sell for more, and it's not BTA

**aeryen**:	means that server did restart and is still loading the stuff from db. you can only wait


[13-Oct-21 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	devs meant to fix that some time because it's getting more often recently with increased player numbers


[13-Oct-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Efan**:	be carefull player Penida_Industries is taking ADs and holding them

[13-Oct-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah he took an ad for me, delivered it in time, was just a longer contract for me.


[13-Oct-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	at least they are not breaching contracts right?


[13-Oct-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	very true, not a problem for me as long as they're delivered in time

**Wingeder**:	XDDD


[13-Oct-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	But I wont have to ship FE :DDDD


[13-Oct-21 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	About that; I have a proposal to anyone who is interested: enter into several open contracts with me, left unfulfilled by either side (so as to make extending it be my problem), up until when I procure the goods, at which point we will fill it. Thinking of buying FE/LST and selling RAT/DW/C, in particular, because it would be nice to just trade the Hortusian consumables back into NCC without having to visit MOR CX to complete each supply run.

[14-Oct-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	lol there is a good brewery near where i live that makes a some great stouts


[14-Oct-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	oatmeal stouts are the best


[14-Oct-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	specifically chocolate/coffee based ones


[14-Oct-21 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah, yeah.. I know.. Maybe once I get my plant biz up and running, and pay off all my expenses, I might get it.


[14-Oct-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-21 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Sell ads up on LM, if anyone is interested


[14-Oct-21 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	No need to pay me until I fulfil my end.


[14-Oct-21 10:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Oct-21 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	DW spiking any minute now, then.


[15-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Why


[15-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	oh lol


[15-Oct-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Oversupply again


[15-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Mhm, H2O spike from new player wave caused H2O production to ramp up, crashed H2O then that caused DW to crash


[15-Oct-21 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	While DW was crashing though, it drank all the H2O and also everybody stopped making H2O because it was crashing.


[15-Oct-21 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	So its a tsunami-wave-after-effect off the new players H2O.NC1

**SR5473**:	H2O still decent price


[15-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	There's a bit of a pioneer shortage on Verdant


[15-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	so a lot of folks that expanded into H2O recently are just waiting on pops


[15-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I expect a supply spike here in a POPR or two


[15-Oct-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Oh yeah - I'm prepping the auction materials later today, so keep an eye out for it :-)


[15-Oct-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

**jorre**:	Anyone got consumables on vallis? I may have been away for two months

[15-Oct-21 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	super low on DW/RAT at the moment, but I can help w/ DW/RAT/COF/KOM if you need


[15-Oct-21 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I've got more coming in within a day


[15-Oct-21 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**jorre**:	I ended up just doing some shopping on cx. There is a few shipping ads if someone wants to haul half of the cx to here :P


[15-Oct-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I thought I'd never see the price of iron under 300


[15-Oct-21 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	when i first started FE got below 200


[15-Oct-21 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	which SUCKED as someone who started as a FE smelter


[15-Oct-21 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	look at the 180d on fe


[15-Oct-21 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	FE at that price was great for basic constructors that didn't make their own


[15-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but terrible for those who are selling FE to make a living


[15-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	and at that time i didnt have pro so i had to ship it all to the CX


[15-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Meanwhile I sell FE to get it out of my inventory :(


[15-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	which reduced profit even more


[15-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You probably get better FE prices there though


[15-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	no


[15-Oct-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	not then


[15-Oct-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	at least compared to trying to sell it on a planet that makes tons of it


[15-Oct-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or I guess megatons of it


[15-Oct-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	since one unit is already "tons of it"


[15-Oct-21 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	CX prices are right around the local price


[15-Oct-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Honestly I'm not sure why I make FE


[15-Oct-21 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess other than to prevent my SMEs from idling


[15-Oct-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I probably don't need 5 at least


[15-Oct-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Had 6


[15-Oct-21 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Oct-21 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but still a higher than average return?


[15-Oct-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I make decent on my FS, it was better until the 2nd UTS nerf. now i just make those when i have a large supply of MFK/SFKs


[15-Oct-21 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	only problem with them is they either trickle out or someone comes and buys out the whole stockpile


[15-Oct-21 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	very little inbetween


[15-Oct-21 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	like today i sold 2 instances of 2 each... but about 4 days ago someone bought 120 SFKs from me.

**Wingeder**:	Oof


[15-Oct-21 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	eh, I can make more than that in 1 day.

**Wingeder**:	*When you got 90060 in total sales but only 9k profit because everything is priced too low :(((*


[15-Oct-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	55 BBH, 52 BSE, and 8 BDE


[15-Oct-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Oct-21 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	the month ago market you mean


[15-Oct-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	151500 sales and 70K PROFIT


[15-Oct-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	REEEEEEEEEEEEEeeee


[15-Oct-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah, the month ago market.


[15-Oct-21 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I think.. I'm only gonna sell like half of this, and then just wait till the market is reasonable again.


[15-Oct-21 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	use it for your own expansions


[15-Oct-21 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	im going to be dropping 2 new bases with this low fab pricing


[15-Oct-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	tho they are gonna be subsidised a bit because of a group effort we have going on


[15-Oct-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I dont have any expansions I can support


[15-Oct-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	upgrade your base, then drop a new base


[15-Oct-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Unless aeryn is wrong about contracts going poof after the expiry date


[15-Oct-21 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah, but the new base costs Lfabs for CM and 100k of INS


[15-Oct-21 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you going to join me on Ironforge?


[15-Oct-21 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I could just skip my AMM base idea, and go for Circe, but the AMM will easily bring in a crapton of money.


[15-Oct-21 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Nah, AMM gaseous.


[15-Oct-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	IF does honestly look quite nice though.. just.. too little ROI.. esp in this prefab market


[15-Oct-21 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	make MHLs there


[15-Oct-21 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	If aeryn is wrong, those contracts I have with you are worth 2.2k FE, and that will last a very long time.


[15-Oct-21 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Hmmm nice idea.


[15-Oct-21 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	i think i may do a little of that

[15-Oct-21 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Oct-21 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Unlike other planets, it would be super expensive to re-work it as market conditions change


[15-Oct-21 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Of course BMPs are stupidly worker intensive on a planet I'm already short on workers

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	nickels being made on every sale


[16-Oct-21 04:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	specially with the C prices soo high. its more than the FE


[16-Oct-21 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	FLX does seem to be coming down a bit tho at least


[16-Oct-21 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	yea, I'm right now preparing some excels to math how much exactly I pay for making FE, as I think that, at the current price, I'm making a loss


[16-Oct-21 04:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	roughly anything below 300 isnt worth it. below 290 your selling it at a loss, specially if you ship it.


[16-Oct-21 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	because costs of workers and building degration also count towards the price


[16-Oct-21 04:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	haven't still count the building degradation, just the workers


[16-Oct-21 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	finally I have an excel for all the math involving the FE production


[16-Oct-21 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	without building mantenience nor fuel costs for transporting the stuff


[16-Oct-21 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	If you import all the resources for FE, at the current price and with 110% efficiency, you start making a loss at 252NCC


[16-Oct-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	with local FEO, you start making a loss at 205NCC


[16-Oct-21 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	and 193NCC if you have local harvesting of O


[16-Oct-21 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	that on the recipe without FLX


[16-Oct-21 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	with FLX, values are 214, 179, 170 NCC


[16-Oct-21 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	have you seen Rain's base planner? that takes all of those things into account for any material


[16-Oct-21 06:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	no, I haven't


[16-Oct-21 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	check out community resources on the wiki, there's a bunch of great tools there


[16-Oct-21 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	you mean the master base planner, right?


[16-Oct-21 06:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	very interesting tools ty


[16-Oct-21 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-21 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	?


[16-Oct-21 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Market Makers


[16-Oct-21 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	It's a floor/ceiling on the CX that has an infinite supply


[16-Oct-21 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I see, thanks


[16-Oct-21 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Oct-21 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	So I tried to buy 20 FE and there was nowhere to put it... so it looks like the CX took my money, and... the FE was jettisoned into spacE?


[16-Oct-21 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Any advice on how to fix that?


[16-Oct-21 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WarpDrifter**:	I think its in your contracts


[16-Oct-21 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WarpDrifter**:	Check your Sidebar, if the inventory in your Cx warehouse is full it keeps it 'floating' as a contract ready to receive


[16-Oct-21 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	You've been here for 187 days and dont know about CONT?!............That... doesnt make sense..


[16-Oct-21 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Not knowing what happens when you make a CX purchase with a full inventory and not knowing about contracts are not the same thing...


[16-Oct-21 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WarpDrifter**:	I rarely use that buffer, few contracts I had were on 'Pending Contracts' sidebar. Is that must make sense, Wingeder?


[16-Oct-21 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Lol Wing fair point.  I actually have encountered this before WAAAAAAYYYYY Back when I first started playing. It's been so long I completely forgot.  Soon as someone told me my mind when "derp, of course that's how it works"


[16-Oct-21 09:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	I don't deal in FE and LST very often so I rarely have enough stuff in the warehouse/ship to run into capacity issues


[16-Oct-21 09:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ah oof lol, yeah that makes sense.

[17-Oct-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	There's a few hundred Carbon on the CX


[17-Oct-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Or do you mean the Local Market?


[17-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Oh, there is?


[17-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	I missed that


[17-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Thanks, the last time I checked was last night, and like I said I'm very much a noob and I didn't know how fluid the market is


[17-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Yeah, Carbon is sold in the "Elements" section under the name "C"


[17-Oct-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Thanks


[17-Oct-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	no worries


[17-Oct-21 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Of course I just sent off my ship with all the construction stuff I just bought, so now I'm just going to wait until I have some more iron to sell


[17-Oct-21 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	ooof, yeah that sucks


[17-Oct-21 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lokiorin**:	sure thing, feel free to ask questions


[17-Oct-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Best advice I can give off the cuff is that this is a very slow game early on


[17-Oct-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	the biggest mistake I think new players make is trying to do too much at once


[17-Oct-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Yeah, I can't say that suprises me


[17-Oct-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yep - patience is key


[17-Oct-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	I'm just waiting until I get a bit more refined iron to sell it, because it's not worth the fuel to cart iron ore to the exchange


[17-Oct-21 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	yeah that makes sense.  Iron is a great place to be on Vallis but good lord is it heavy


[17-Oct-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Indeed


[17-Oct-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	you may want to plan your expansion to try and get a Prefab Plant Mk1 (PP1) or 2.  Converting FE into BSE or BBH will make it a lot easier to move


[17-Oct-21 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Yeah, thanks


[17-Oct-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	I should have the crap to do that because I just bought enough to set up in agriculture, but that sounds like a better idea


[17-Oct-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	ooo yeah, I would recommend against Agriculture on Vallis.


[17-Oct-21 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	It's not undoable but it's not very efficient


[17-Oct-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	Ok, thanks


[17-Oct-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	You most likely just saved me a lot of trouble


[17-Oct-21 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	what would you be growing?


[17-Oct-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	I don't really know yet, most likely whatever would get me carbon


[17-Oct-21 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**doggos314**:	But it looks like its better just to buy it for now


[17-Oct-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Indeed - it's much more efficient to buy the carbon inputs - if you need a few to get started let me know


[17-Oct-21 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	yeah, that would be a very narrow margin at best.  You'd be making maybe 10 GRN or similar a day


[17-Oct-21 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	or at least that's what my base planner says


[17-Oct-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Once you get fully set up on Vallis though, YI-715b (Verdant) is a great place to set up an agriculture base - it was my second base and I definitely don't regret it


[17-Oct-21 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	I am the same as Stelio.  First base here, second on Verdant


[17-Oct-21 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Diokana**:	why verdant over promitor? for the extra O production?


[17-Oct-21 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Diokana**:	I'm thinking about doing the same, trying to decide between the two


[17-Oct-21 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Verdant is closer and outside of faction space so no taxes


[17-Oct-21 02:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Also, Verdant runs the Agriculture CoGC program 24/7 (not sure about Prom)


[17-Oct-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and, I'm relatively sure there's a stronger shipping capacity between Verdant & Vallis than between Prom & Vallis. I could be wrong


[17-Oct-21 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	definitely higher volume


[17-Oct-21 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	lol.. and, Verdant runs on NCC - so you don't have to worry about currency exchanges'


[17-Oct-21 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Who... even uses the FX?.. just like.. trade back C/DW/RAT or forth with Bfabs/FE


[17-Oct-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Diokana**:	ah okay that all makes sense.  I wasn't sure how much the extra 4% fertility would matter when choosing between the two


[17-Oct-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I use the FX to find people that need to exchange currencies, then work out 1:1 deals with them :-)


[17-Oct-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	no fuel required. ;-)


[17-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I meant more the process of dealing with multiple currencies


[17-Oct-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	not actually using the FXOB - if you ever need currency that bad just say something - most of the time FXOB is a waste

[17-Oct-21 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is enough traffic, you can just toss an ad up and someoen should pick it up

**collot999**:	Interesting that any one wants steel cheaper than the ask price in the station


[18-Oct-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	CXP STL.NC1


[18-Oct-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you mean local?


[18-Oct-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	and personally i think that price for STL is low. its expensive to make and moves slow


[18-Oct-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	yes, right now on the local market is an offer of 16 steel for 650NCC/u


[18-Oct-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	shipping fees. @ 7.85t each FE and STL isnt fun to move, trust me


[18-Oct-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	offer was there from yesterday, on the LM of vallis


[18-Oct-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	also might better to sell cheap than to have full inventory and not produce anything


[18-Oct-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	^


[18-Oct-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	sell at a loss or have idle machines


[18-Oct-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	It's probably not a loss


[18-Oct-21 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but you can still turn a profit with STL at that price, its just too small for my tastes


[18-Oct-21 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	say with current prices FE is around 300ppu and you need 4 O at 50ppu thats 500min for STL, not including costs of food and repair


[18-Oct-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	FE is cheaper now. and if you have 5 experts it can get really cheap


[18-Oct-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	actually, if you buy the FE, even 600NCC may be a loss


[18-Oct-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I always figure out the costs as if i sold myself all the mats to myself.


[18-Oct-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	including food


[18-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	but does not apply if you make the FE


[18-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	FE@250 + 4xO@40 is what you could probably buy, lower if produced self


[18-Oct-21 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	"If I sold my FE I get 20% profit on it, if i refine it into X I will get 15% profit on the FE. Thats not worth it"


[18-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	there is a slight error there, the STL recipe is 2FE and 8O


[18-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	all mats i produce are sold then rebought by me.


[18-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	and produce 2 STL


[18-Oct-21 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its a half recipe.


[18-Oct-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	2 FE + 8 O = 2 STL or 1 FE + 4 O = 1STL


[18-Oct-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	oh true


[18-Oct-21 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if it was somethign like 3 FE + 7 O = 2 STL then its trickier


[18-Oct-21 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I just went ahead and used the normal recipe on my sheet


[18-Oct-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	or the CU  is a prime example. 5 CUO + 10 O + 1 SIO = 3 CU


[18-Oct-21 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	cant half that recipe easily


[18-Oct-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	the other thing is, STL is still not used that much


[18-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	probably main use is for PT, but that gives a lot of PT/d


[18-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	^ it also burns A LOT of O


[18-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	1,67 CUO + 3,33 O + 0,33 SIO = 1 CU


[18-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	not as much as CU but still


[18-Oct-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	besides PT, it's basically shipbuilding or rfabs


[18-Oct-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its a very slow moving product. so there isnt a large pile of it laying around


[18-Oct-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	still, when making the math for the prices, I prefer to use the original values and then divide the result by the amount produced


[18-Oct-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	sure, it just was that for STL the inputs were such nice numbers after dividing them :)


[18-Oct-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	easy head math


[18-Oct-21 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	yea, I agree on STL beeng esay to divide


[18-Oct-21 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	few recipes are smooth like that


[18-Oct-21 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	btw, someone knows where I can get more info about how the buildings get damaged and how that affects the resources needed for repairs?


[18-Oct-21 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	they just degrade over time


[18-Oct-21 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	they will eventually start slowing down your production if they get too bad


[18-Oct-21 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is a sweet spot for repairs, depending on the buildings. usually before the mass of parts ticks over.


[18-Oct-21 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	your MCG will tick the fastest, you can use that as a guide when to repair


[18-Oct-21 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	is more for adding the datta to the math in a spreadsheet I'm making


[18-Oct-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	from my understading its a time thing, and its just a % degradation. depending on the mats. at 50% you will need 50% of the mats used to build it.


[18-Oct-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but i think it reaches full degradation at like 80% condition and it just slowly gets worse? i dont know.


[18-Oct-21 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	none of my building got that far


[18-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	from the wiki, the minimun efficiency factor a building can have is 33%


[18-Oct-21 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I would NEVER let it get that low...


[18-Oct-21 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**collot999**:	what I'm trying to work out is, on the time a recipe is done, how much a building may have degraded, and based on that, how much that increases the price at which someone may make a loss


[18-Oct-21 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	i dont know off hand, but someone has done that work already. just need to find where its posted


[18-Oct-21 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	might be in the community resources in the wiki?


[18-Oct-21 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	there is an old google sheet which calculates e.g. how many materials are deprecated after a given number of days and stuff, but it is a bit outdated and does not fit exactly anymore


[18-Oct-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	you could ask in the official discord or better in the PCT discord if you already are there


[18-Oct-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Silverflash**:	Even though im not part of 'those' new commanders, thank you. im a manufacturer, started 3 days ago. just got another HB1 and COL, im now hydrogen self-sufficient. currently im producing 400 polyethylene per day, after i have recovered financially from the hydrogen investment, im going to invest in another HB1 and BMP to convert the polyethylene into other products i can sell. does that sound efficient?


[22-Oct-21 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	it might be a bit harsh to hear that Vallis isn't a great place to extract H in this case :( it's only got a small concentration that makes it fairly unappealing to collect here


[22-Oct-21 04:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	however! PE should be fairly easy to sell all around even without being processed into something else since a lot of people need it for various things and building more BMPs sounds like a good idea


[22-Oct-21 04:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	@Xrash Dammit, the Wiki told me that this Planet is a good idea


[22-Oct-21 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	but ok that just means that ill grow slower

[22-Oct-21 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	I think it recommended this planet not for the H, but because this planet is full of metallurgists, meaning that you'll get esely large amounts of FE and some STL


[22-Oct-21 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	well, if you've only built the collector recently, it might be sensible to just demolish it and build something else (an EXT, for example, would be much better here and takes same materials as a COL)


[22-Oct-21 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	since you're on the wiki already, I suggest you head over to the community resources page - there's some great tools there. rain's master base planner is one hell of a spreadsheet that'll help put some things into perspective


[22-Oct-21 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	you mean the EXT so he sells the FEO, no?


[22-Oct-21 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	yeah, shipping off FEO to CX for sale should give a much better return on investment, and when starting out your ships tend to fly mostly empty (at least mine did) so it doesn't matter much that it's heavy


[22-Oct-21 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	and even if you sell it at MM (32/u) it won't be at a loss, pretty sure (though, do math that one out instead of just believing me!)


[22-Oct-21 05:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	ok, thanks for the tips, i might then take the supplies with the next time i go to CX, i have exactly enough extra workforce capacity for an EXT, though ill keep the COL, otherwise i will still be hydrogen dependent, at the moment i just need hydrocarbon plants to keep it going, and i already bought 40 of those, which means less travel to the CX.


[22-Oct-21 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	welp, to give some actual data, extract H here cost almost 65NCC/u, while in the LM you can find it at an ask price of 82NCC


[22-Oct-21 05:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	82NCC/u


[22-Oct-21 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	wait why 65NNC/u? i pay 8.33 NNC per Hydrogen collection


[22-Oct-21 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	also i dont have pro so no access to the LM


[22-Oct-21 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	but you also need to own the building and feed the pioneers operating it. eventually you'll need to repair it too


[22-Oct-21 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	you pay 8.33NCC in fees + food, water and overalls for the 6.3h that takes to gather the H


[22-Oct-21 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	ok, i didnt calculate it like that per production line, but good to know


[22-Oct-21 05:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	still need to learn how much damage takes the buildings over time and how that affects in materials for add it to my spreadsheet


[22-Oct-21 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	i didnt account for repairs at all, ****


[22-Oct-21 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prae**:	I recently did the math on it given the market average i found i was only losing 5-10 buy just buying it from the cx


[22-Oct-21 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	to give you some peace of mind, you don't really need to consider repairs for another month or two


[22-Oct-21 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	oh ok thank god ill be out of my financial dire situation then


[22-Oct-21 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prae**:	I just started really earning money again, I expanded my production lines too early to actually make us of them and was bogged down by the upkeep for a while


[22-Oct-21 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	ouch


[22-Oct-21 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prae**:	But woohoo for actualy making a profit


[22-Oct-21 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prae**:	now at least lol


[22-Oct-21 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	i just have 1000 NNC remaining from the starter money because of that HB1 and COL


[22-Oct-21 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prae**:	I finally have roughly 30k again finally


[22-Oct-21 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	same happened to me, but just as I finish increasing the ammount of SML I have, the price of iron drop even more than I thought and I bearly could keep up with pioneer needs and the price of carbon to keep making FE


[22-Oct-21 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prae**:	trying to decide what to start manufacturing next though manly focused on pt and exo's


[22-Oct-21 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prae**:	mainly*


[22-Oct-21 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	ok yea it will be a while until i can get that extractor


[22-Oct-21 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	or


[22-Oct-21 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	wait


[22-Oct-21 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	don't get too hung up on that extractor :P it's probably not the best thing you can build, just suggested it as a replacement for a COL


[22-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	technically, ignoring all the extra worker needs and hydrocarbon plants, both of which i stockpiled a lot of, i am making 3762 NNC in PE per day, and like said it will be a long time until i need to start worrying about those side costs


[22-Oct-21 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	well what do the extractors produce again?


[22-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	the game doesnt want to tell me


[22-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	FEO, 14 every 12h


[22-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	hm ok


[22-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	well, they produce whatever mineral deposits the planet has - here it's FEO. over on Montem, it's LST or FEO (though less FEO than here)


[22-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	more or less


[22-Oct-21 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	depending on efficien factors


[22-Oct-21 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	also don't be afraid to fail some - COLIQ lets you start again from scratch if you feel like you've gone too far down the wrong road


[22-Oct-21 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	another option is, sell the extra BSE and buy with that money the rest of what you need for another BMP


[22-Oct-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	ok yea i cant use FEO for the PE, unless i get a smelter and a prefab plant to produce BTA, which i probably wont lol


[22-Oct-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	hm


[22-Oct-21 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	well two exports means two markets means more financial stability


[22-Oct-21 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	even though PE covers many markets


[22-Oct-21 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	tecnicly, here, for every extarctor you can supply 2 SML working fully on FE


[22-Oct-21 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	with a total of 16FE/day (more or less)


[22-Oct-21 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	wow thats a lot considering CX price


[22-Oct-21 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	isn't as much with the current price, FE cost near 200NCC/u to make


[22-Oct-21 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	well, it's pretty much up to you what you want to do - the game doesn't really shove you into any directions. many people choose to go somewhat vertical (make their own inputs) at the beginning but it's also perfectly viable to go horizontal (make one type of building exclusively) if you find a market that'll support that (biased pitch - it's easier to do that in a corporation)


[22-Oct-21 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	and the reason why you might want to put all your eggs in one basket is experts - it's the one "free" way of boosting your production rates


[22-Oct-21 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	right yea they have crazy boosts


[22-Oct-21 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	hm ok thank yall for helping


[22-Oct-21 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Silverflash**:	ill consider my choices now.


[22-Oct-21 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	no problem at all :) feel free to ask for pointers in general - game has a pretty great community


[22-Oct-21 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	sounds sweet.


[22-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-21 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yep, plenty of bfabs - make sure you refresh!


[24-Oct-21 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	115 BBH, 44 BSE, 115 BDE, and 29 BTA so far


[24-Oct-21 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	should be enough to get to 5x SST and 2x INF. Also, the 6 HAB for PAR #2 will be finished in a couple of days

[27-Oct-21 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I'm back from my busy


[27-Oct-21 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oka so this is NOT I repeat not okay! -- In a stunning turn of events, Phobos now has more TEC, _and_ ENG, then we do.


[27-Oct-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Reeeeeeee having 61% ENG tec really paid off for them, and I'll guess it was also quite easy for them to fill that happiness, what with their PIO and SET being far less then even Prox now, coming in at 63k and 9.36k respectively


[27-Oct-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Compared to Proxion's 39 ENG and 1.65k tec and 9.4k, 93k for SET and PIO respectively


[27-Oct-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yeah - might take a bit to improve, since our population is sucking up Safety/Health - hopefully the current auction nips that in the bud


[27-Oct-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also Montem finnaly got their act together and employed their ENG, now having a full 7 brute forcing their way in (despite 30.8% happi) from their absolutely staggering 2.5k TEC


[27-Oct-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Dont interrupt a newsman


[27-Oct-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Promitor is trying the same tactic with their 18 ENG, and a level of TEC surpassing even our own now, at 1.5k compared to our 1.3k


[27-Oct-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Haha thought this was more of a podcast format? My apologies :-)


[27-Oct-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ah neat idea! Thanks for the call :D


[27-Oct-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Katoa is building, but is seeming to have some popi issues with low tec happiness, and so, not counting their growing set, falling almost completely out of the top 6 league


[27-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I feel like plants like Vallis, Prom, and Montem, are just too big for their own good


[27-Oct-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	All the POPI gets eaten by the 125k, 180k, and 167k PIO


[27-Oct-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Speaking of which, considering POPI, we've fallen into a distant second place, with Phobos threatening to overtake with their build on ART and some even on LIB


[27-Oct-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Montem has 3 INF, but otherwise seem to be making little in way of higher tier progress, quite contrary to Proxion who..


[27-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	..I'm actually flabbergasted right now..


[27-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Wingeder**:	Like.. HOW?!?!??!!?


[27-Oct-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Only thing they need now is a LU


[27-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	39 ENG, eh? More ENG = Higher tier factories = Higher tier POPI = Faster ENG gen


[27-Oct-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	oh they also have an ART and 4 SST (and 2 INF(we should really get that 2nd one up of ours.)


[27-Oct-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Alright any callers have any thoughts?


[27-Oct-21 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Besides that the 17.4% Edu that Phobos and 72.8% Comfort that Prox have is just ridiculous?

[28-Oct-21 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-21 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Canidate Labyrinth has publicly admitted to having no idea what he is doing. "This is the type of Govenor you want" he said, but is it really? Do you want someone who is unprepared, or one with a plan? Vote for StelioKontos, a man with a plan to keep his populace safe, and build infrastructure to provide education to all!

[28-Oct-21 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah, since AMM fell and iirc the INS that stelio was cooking for me went into the Saladin project/SNF, I've decided that my 2nd base will actually be on Circe, forming a PG/EPO chain that will feed into my prefabs


[28-Oct-21 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Oct-21 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wingeder**:	Circe be like "Who needs PIO when you can have cHeMiStRY"


[28-Oct-21 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Unemployment: 22.0%


[28-Oct-21 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Meanwhile SET: "Please stop overworking us theres just soo much to do no time to rest ahhh"


[28-Oct-21 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also I find it hilarious how there are actually more SET then PIO on Circe


[28-Oct-21 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	When I get there I should seriously move my BMPs there and maybe make an INC there


[28-Oct-21 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also OMFG THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A UNI!?!?


[28-Oct-21 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Whyyyyyyyyyy


[29-Oct-21 12:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	That's why they have higher tier stuff, I think


[29-Oct-21 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yeah, there's a default bonus for UNI, even with no upkeep. It's really expensive though, and I'm trying to balance/keep costs as low as possible


[29-Oct-21 12:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Those setups are from folks donating millions of ncc to get them up and running haha


[29-Oct-21 01:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	maybe they don't like that you're throwing construction parts in their general direction


[29-Oct-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	or we are out of red meat and beer


[29-Oct-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	also a possibility


[29-Oct-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I though.. nobody ate meat anymore?


[29-Oct-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Whats your source?


[29-Oct-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I want it!


[29-Oct-21 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	(But only if its pasture raised)


[29-Oct-21 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also, if I'm correct, Circe is the first place with a full chem only CoGC? :O Now ya really wanna move there amirite


[29-Oct-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	na. Id rather move to an all metallurgy CoGC planet


[29-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	i was talking to capitan .-.


[29-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	But yeah they should seriously make one of those


[29-Oct-21 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I suppose IF or Celebdil are the ideal places come to think of it.


[29-Oct-21 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I think IF would benifit more from a construction CoGC.(saddly)


[29-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	upcoming	Education Events: Pioneers


[29-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh they have PIO at Celebdil


[29-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Thats just SADDDDDD


[29-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	need someone stoking the fires


[29-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Makes sense tho, honestly


[29-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh so manifold?


[29-Oct-21 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Or would they just get electronics?


[29-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Maybe both?


[29-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Technically ext and then met is better then just pio, even for Celebdil


[29-Oct-21 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	12.5% instead of 10


[29-Oct-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	(atleast assuming you only have 2 industries active on your planet)


[29-Oct-21 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I guess Celebdil prob has guys running PP2 so that oofs that


[29-Oct-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	High volume cargo-bays


[29-Oct-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Whyyyyy do they exist?


[29-Oct-21 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	High weight cargo bays are what the universe needs


[29-Oct-21 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	when you want to move LOTS of gas


[29-Oct-21 12:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	...


[29-Oct-21 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	So like.. let the market get super high and then flood it so much lower then the MM that it starts paying you negative money?


[29-Oct-21 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	in seriousness the high mass hold seems much more useful


[29-Oct-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah


[29-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Like then a base extracting LST on XG-326a actually is feasible


[29-Oct-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	and "logistics" what do you mean logistics? I've never heard that word in my life >.>


[29-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	it makes shipping FE feasible too


[29-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Metallurgists would absolutely loveeeeeee it


[29-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	See


[29-Oct-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I cant wait till i own one

**shadowsneak**:	right?


[29-Oct-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	have you seen the weight of gold?


[29-Oct-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah its almost the weight of W


[29-Oct-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thankfully a little goes a long way, unlike FE


[29-Oct-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Wait... W hy W tf W hy is it different?


[29-Oct-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	AU 19.32 t vs 7.519 t W


[29-Oct-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Thats.. wasnt supposed to happen.. whot?!!?!?!?!?!???!?!!?!?!?


[29-Oct-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats not cool, theyre less than 10% different IRL


[29-Oct-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	w 19.28 g/cm^3


[29-Oct-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	au 19.3 g/cm^3


[29-Oct-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Oct-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The only CoGC that really benefits me a lot is the Verdant agri one


[29-Oct-21 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I'm sorry why tf would they have a constr?!


[29-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Theres no LST


[29-Oct-21 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	You have to ship it all


[29-Oct-21 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	They should have metallurgy 100% or PIO, because then they can smelt the gold from Cortez


[29-Oct-21 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Nah screw it, AU gains like 100t when you smelt its ore wtf


[29-Oct-21 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	AU should have 6.915t weight, based off the AUO weight wtf


[29-Oct-21 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	on top of that, if you needed a m^3 of gold for anything that'd be insanely expensive


[29-Oct-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Rip

[29-Oct-21 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Oct-21 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Which is why global often has "usr1 joined." msgs followed with "usr1 left."


[31-Oct-21 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	But planetchats, regardless of their participation, always say just the "usr1 joined." unless they either demolished their CM or COLIQed / account expired"

**Xenogenic**:	In corp, both of the Vallis LST importers are bone dry


[01-Nov-21 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's honestly strange. I've added EXT's on Montem, but hit the max base size


[01-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I wouldve thought that the new player waves would've started to raise bfabs by now


[01-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Now that I think of it, I keep getting cleaned out on Montem before I can get a shipment up in the air


[01-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	OOF well thats kinda weird..


[01-Nov-21 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Somebody importing it to the CX for you?


[01-Nov-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Doubt it, it's soo heavy


[01-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also, as far as Benten is concerned, it has kinda stabilized thanks to Fuyut just handing out essentially free (55/u) handfulls of LST from their BER base


[01-Nov-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*BTS base, I get the two confused


[01-Nov-21 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	LST is lighter then FE though..


[01-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Lol that it is


[01-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	But yeah, FTL ships would really drop LST prices alottttt


[01-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I dunno, SIO is still crazy isn't it?


[01-Nov-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	1.79t wdym?


[01-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	No no price and demand wise


[01-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Oh prices: SIO.NC1


[01-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ouwch


[01-Nov-21 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That would put the smoking gun in MCG's hands still


[01-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Probably it's this wave that came from everyone burning through their LST reserves


[01-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Folks usually stockpile the heck out of LST


[01-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I ran outta H so I had to switch to MCG production to keep my now 2 BMPs online..


[01-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Aha!


[01-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	That could be doing it


[01-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	#thiswillprobablyexplodeinmyface


[01-Nov-21 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You know, H is funny. A very few players can supply all of a region's demand


[01-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	And now I'm out of SIO and almost outta LST


[01-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ye true


[01-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And one of our guys that was operating an H tap closed it to move to Outer Heaven


[01-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ahhh! Ofc!


[01-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Not saying that caused it... but


[01-Nov-21 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You in the market for an H tap ;-)


[01-Nov-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*I used to have an idea for an AMM cold gg, but now that amm has fell and isnt 100/u anymore it looks more profitable to just make a base for self-PG-consumption/EPO/Rfabs)


[01-Nov-21 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	(But now a H tap seems decent lmao, that is, if I had the mats/profit supply to make one)


[01-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah I priced one out the other day... 400k


[01-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I'ma just buy my H from Hortus now, its not cheap over there but its cheaper then here, because of the Hortus f tap, I suppose.


[01-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Or so


[01-Nov-21 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Brah how many col you running?


[01-Nov-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	200 PIO worth. GG are usually cold, so AEF and INS


[01-Nov-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Mine was like 80k from AEF and 100k from INS and then the BSE = 300k


[01-Nov-21 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah 3 COL was my plan.


[01-Nov-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Just pulled it up. 376k


[01-Nov-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I kept alternating between Harbinger and an AMM gasoues


[01-Nov-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	6 COL


[01-Nov-21 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ah, yeah that would do it.


[01-Nov-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	They take so long to plan there's a chance someone will beat you to it


[01-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*Someone did, apparently*


[01-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	AMM.NC1


[01-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I keep thinking about ways of making REA. All the big boys are making bank off of the ADR MM but REA is the limiting factor


[01-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	BRM, eh?


[01-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I do have one ELP making SAR's so I'm part of the chain ^^


[01-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Alot of places have that in slivers..


[01-Nov-21 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah BRM and CHM I believe


[01-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	CLI


[01-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Hmmm...


[01-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Nah that's SOI BRM and CLI


[01-Nov-21 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah


[01-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Outer Heaven has a T1 world with BRM, lol


[01-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	But yeah it's 2.5 days away, I'm not gonna try and sell it to you as the best thing since sliced bread


[01-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I remember a tiny galerite planet 10 jumps from Benten, it was habitable and had a decent amount of BRM


[01-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Lol


[01-Nov-21 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Bagels are better then sliced bread


[01-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	XH-083a is pretty close to MOR but needs INS


[01-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yea, iirc there is alot of BRM nearby Saladin area


[01-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	TD-228b is our BRM, GAL, AMM planet in Outer Heaven


[01-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Stelio grabbed a BRM SEA in actually the same system I wanted to AMM tap out of


[01-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Far away, but make your own fuel if you like. We're gonna be swimming in H up there. Since that's where the local H tap went ^^


[01-Nov-21 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	XD true


[01-Nov-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Stelio... you're probably thinking of IZ-768b


[01-Nov-21 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	One needs LM for O-H, atleast until they win the challenge and get a CX (then I will consider moving up there)


[01-Nov-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	All the core worlds have LM and WAR so far


[01-Nov-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yea, I had been going to settle IZ-768h


[01-Nov-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*sad trial noises*


[01-Nov-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	cant do much with that sad trial


[01-Nov-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	IZ-768f is where the H tap used to be


[01-Nov-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	.-.


[01-Nov-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	OOF that would explain the dwindling pop there


[01-Nov-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup, left floating in the atmosphere... or something


[01-Nov-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	slowly packing up their personal ships and flying off


[01-Nov-21 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	*distant screams of endlessly falling guys freezing to death, barely audible above the howling wind*


[01-Nov-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I like to think some of them fell into the GG XD


[01-Nov-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	some


[01-Nov-21 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	When the last Aerostat foundation was demolished


[01-Nov-21 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Brah... This is why you buy Winged™ AEF, with built in safety features! (coming.. "soon™")


[01-Nov-21 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Anyways how do you demolish an AEF? Let the neon out?


[01-Nov-21 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	release valve?

[01-Nov-21 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I'm slowly amassing AEF and INS for a project, but also I think secretly hoping H and AR fall before I commit to it


[01-Nov-21 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	or at least not immediately afterwards as usually happens


[01-Nov-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	*cough, H tap


[01-Nov-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Wait fall before?


[01-Nov-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean if I just wanted H, I'd go 1 jump away


[01-Nov-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but there's no AR on the market right now


[01-Nov-21 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Right it made less sense the more I thought about it


[01-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Soo... XG-452f or RC-040f?


[01-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Totally XG if you want H too.


[01-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	And while I could just ignore H prices since they're such a minor inconvenience, the lack of AR is... concerning


[01-Nov-21 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, XG


[01-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Two birds one stone


[01-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You'd be doing a service


[01-Nov-21 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It's two jumps out from Prism too, but that doesn't super help me since Prism doesn't consume H/AR and generally sends back full ships


[01-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I could cut back HE production, and have H be the thing that fills my ship's volume while other Prism stuff fills the weight


[01-Nov-21 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Everyone I know with a Prism base has tons of HE and SIO to haul, all the time


[01-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This is why I'm not considering any of the outer planets. I can barely maintain my current ones


[01-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I'm tempted to ramp up SIO production even more, which would really tie up a ship :(


[01-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Shipping ads? Or will a glass ship help?


[01-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Not really


[01-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I burn enough fuel to make in system trips take a few hours


[01-Nov-21 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so a glass ship would help marginally


[01-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Well, I guess it would make me more confident in sending my other ships further


[01-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Right, you just gun it through MOR then


[01-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Actually, the guy with the Prism base, did get a glass ship to relieve strain from MOR shipping


[01-Nov-21 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Now if I built a Prom or Katoa/Umbra base, I'd get a glass ship


[01-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	because those two are so far from my main base that I'd need to not tie up any of my shipping there


[01-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I just don't have very much urgent shipping in MOR now


[01-Nov-21 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Hmm that makes sense. Kind of makes me want one... but you know, half a mill ^^


[01-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[01-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Like I can afford it


[01-Nov-21 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but also... is that really the best?


[01-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	For that money I could get a bunch of POLs on the GG to condense the H into PG and reduce the strain on my shipping


[01-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	also my Prism base does use PG


[01-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	lots of it


[01-Nov-21 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	it's my manufacturing base


[01-Nov-21 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I just worry that FTL ships will come around and glass STL ships start looking like out of date things


[01-Nov-21 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SmartDog**:	I believe we've got tons of AR around if you want me to look into it


[01-Nov-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Petition to call the Saladin region the Outer Planets Alliance.


[01-Nov-21 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Or maybe just the Outer Heaven Alliance, yeah that sounds like it would have less copyright infringement XD


[01-Nov-21 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	P.s. I think the proposed name for XG was Harbinger, due to it being the gateway to INS mass production via its beautiful H and AR deposits.


[01-Nov-21 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also, you could just put POLs on Prism.


[01-Nov-21 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I am kind of curious about AR


[01-Nov-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Don't want to commit to a 1m+ base if it's just going to re-appear on the market soon


[01-Nov-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'm not out of it yet, but the fact that the price has more than doubled and there's none to buy is... concerning


[01-Nov-21 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I could go back to making rfabs


[01-Nov-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	On the other hand if AR stays this high, I'd probably want to produce more than I can use and sell the rest


[01-Nov-21 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I'd probably do that anyway

[09-Nov-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	I posted this in general, but putting it here too. Not only would you be earning profit, but you'd be helping out the local economy and stabilising imports to reduce the likelihood of shortages.


[09-Nov-21 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	Fission Ships Logistics is looking to expand again! We need pilots to fly regular shipping contracts. If you have a ship sitting idle most of the time, it's time to put it to work, earning you profit every day with just a few clicks here and there. LM access is required. We are based out of Moria, payments are in NCC. We promise guaranteed, non-stop shipping contracts, so you'll never have any downtime between runs, so you'll never not be earning. PM for more details if interested.


[09-Nov-21 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	I've also begun local NAB fuel production, so I can service both LMs in the system.


[09-Nov-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	That was fast on my first 300.


[09-Nov-21 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	It'll take awhile to build up a reserve without any experts and only a couple refineries.  I'll be able to add more once my ship gets back and I can bring in more NAB from the Cookhouse.

[09-Nov-21 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rek**:	Hey all, I've built an LM & WAR on Pallada (Moria Shipyard planet). This makes purchasing/building ships much easier, as the purchaser no longer has to ship all of the parts out there themselves (which was especially painful when the reason for buying a ship is usually a lack of available shipping capacity lol).


[12-Nov-21 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	can do 10k/u


[16-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	so I think going forward instead of doing clothing sales I am just going to say I will accept and fill orders for OVE with prices of 50/u or more, and PWO with prices of 120/u or more. So if you need some, just post away and I will do my best to fill them. If you want to place large orders, please give me longer times on the ads or contact me ahead of time. Thanks!


[16-Nov-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-21 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	so if you want to help out and make some money, you can bid in and try to help fulfill those

[19-Nov-21 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	@Blake1216 I go over the optimum strategies in the #bidding-info channel - the reserve price is the maximum price for the total amount of materials. The maximum bid is 1.25x that amount


[19-Nov-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	The best strategy is to bid your 'true value' - if you bid less than this, it's a price you're unwilling to accept for the goods - if you bid more than this, you risk losing the bid for a price you were willing to accept


[19-Nov-21 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Nov-21 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	I'm fairly certain that the profit is going to be awful, but I'd like the convenience of not having to import so much from the CX


[19-Nov-21 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Convenience


[19-Nov-21 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but I doubt that's the only think you're importing


[19-Nov-21 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and if you're importing a lot, that's not something you could harvest here


[19-Nov-21 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	Yeah, I'm thinking of building two collectors with my 750 -> 1000 expansion in order to fuel my 7 smelters


[19-Nov-21 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	It would be a convenience yeah, but not really the best idea


[19-Nov-21 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	7 smelters of 12 hour batches is 14 oxygen/d, and according to a spreadsheet - a collector produces 8.4 oxygen per day, which would be able to sustain myself

**TwilightSentinel**:	The additional cost of those for the collector would quickly offset the benefits of extracting O or H locally.


[19-Nov-21 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Not to mention you're spending a lot of money on BSEs that could have been spent on something that would actually make a larger profit and let you buy a lot more O or H.


[19-Nov-21 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Nov-21 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	Yep, doesn't hit you until that logistic curve starts to show itself and your production suddenly plummets from being 100% for a good two months to 90% suddenly


[24-Nov-21 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	It's amazing how far I've come in three months though, watching the base slowly expand


[24-Nov-21 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	And then again in 3 months from now.. agreed - watching the snowball grow is worth the wait xD


[24-Nov-21 02:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Heya folks - just a quick update for everyone, so you all can plan accordingly - after we get the 2nd PAR finished, we need to build 3x SST before we move any further - this should get us over 90% in all categories other than culture/education - giving us the boost we need to expand TEC/ENG.


[24-Nov-21 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	We have ~450 open TEC jobs and ~200 open ENG jobs, so the quicker we expand these out, the quicker you all get the population you need!


[24-Nov-21 02:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	This will take a rediculous amount of bfabs - BDE is gonna be the main blocker - start planning ahead... therer will be enough fabs for everyone to get a hand on selling some


[24-Nov-21 02:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	On that note- to minimize cost, I may be procuring them directly rather than via auction - if I decide to do this, I'll ensure everyone has the ability to voice their interest in getting involved

[24-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	welcome! glad to have you here! feel free to ask questions, the community is extremely helpful overall


[24-Nov-21 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Got my base set up, In process of mining and smelting iron ore into iron, sent a ship to the exchange to get more oxygen. Eventually, I'd like to manage to build a gas extractor so I can get my own...


[24-Nov-21 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	and thanks for the welcome. :-)


[24-Nov-21 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Welcome @OyVader ! I think you'll like it on Vallis


[24-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	Welcome, however do not build a collector for oxygen on Vallis.  It's just not worth the investment.


[24-Nov-21 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	You consume so little, it's basically nothing to buy it on the CX.


[24-Nov-21 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TwilightSentinel**:	While almost anything else you could do would generate more money than an O collector and let you buy way more O.


[24-Nov-21 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Cool. Duly noted. :-)


[24-Nov-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Also, remember to buy FLX at the CX so you can smelt more efficiently!


[24-Nov-21 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Thanks. For now, should I just focus on smelting and selling iron?


[24-Nov-21 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	to start, its good to focus one one thing. but market prices on FE are somewhat weak at the moment


[24-Nov-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well, they keep bouncing 225-275


[24-Nov-21 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	just try to sell for 260+ and you'll be okay


[24-Nov-21 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	FE.NC1


[24-Nov-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	and I assume it's too basic a commodity to go wasting FTL fuel to drag it somewhere else?


[24-Nov-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the difficulty is its weight mostly


[24-Nov-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	and early on in the game you dont want to send a mostly empty ship somewhere on FF fuel


[24-Nov-21 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	MOR is the system that uses FE the most, so its high volume, but lower cost here


[24-Nov-21 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i would say at least 75% of people on montem smelt FEO ;) its kind of the place to be for smelting FEO


[24-Nov-21 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	or maybe only 66%


[24-Nov-21 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	My vote, based off my current stratagy (being a construction primary that does my own metallurgy); Ship a full cargo of FEO or FE whenever you go visit other CXs and sell to the market maker (a npc that buys infinite volume at a very low price) / or whatever bids exist.


[24-Nov-21 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Just to fill up your ship's weight though, as FE isnt particularly profitable anywhere else due to nonexistent demand outside of the Moria CX


[24-Nov-21 03:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Bfabs are what Moria is good at, and thus they are always cheaper here, although with current prices nothing is particularly profitable.


[24-Nov-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	... wouldn't LST be a better option?


[24-Nov-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	You'd actually make some money that way


[24-Nov-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	As much as I will resent the competition in the already over-saturated market of bfabs that I produce, its really the only feasible option


[24-Nov-21 03:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Assuming one starts from metallurgy anyways


[24-Nov-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	I was gonna demo my SME's in favor of PP1's, but now I'm not so sure


[24-Nov-21 03:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	LST isnt on vallis, but yeah its something decent to fill up on at the CX, before making the FTL jump out


[24-Nov-21 03:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Well if you need some LST... it's moving slowly atm for some reason


[24-Nov-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And is booming on Montem. Strange how it flips some days


[24-Nov-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	SIO where its at


[24-Nov-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Ahhh SIO shortage, I assume?


[24-Nov-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Or... shipping shortage?


[24-Nov-21 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I bought some from MOR then realized SIO.NC1 vs SIO.CI1 and that I'm always looking for things to trade back..


[24-Nov-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Damn


[24-Nov-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yup, SIO shortage


[24-Nov-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I got a ship on the way from Benten right now lmao gonna be rich


[24-Nov-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Ah you know, for some reason a lot of folks are getting into large NS/HYF productions on Montem


[24-Nov-21 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	And another one with some BDE to sell for more SIO cash


[24-Nov-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Actually, no idea about if the HYF's are there, but I'm certain there's more NS production, hence the LST uptick there


[24-Nov-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Wait why the literal molp


[24-Nov-21 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yea but fuyut crashed benten LST and so the traders brought it back to MOR LST.NC1 LST.CI1


[24-Nov-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	(Right after I ordered 300 units of LST at 60+/u #reeeeeee)


[24-Nov-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Yeah but why buy on MOR CX when I nuke every buy I see on Montem?


[24-Nov-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Because TRIAL


[24-Nov-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	.-.


[24-Nov-21 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	True, I keep forgetting


[24-Nov-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Fuyu's LST is on MOR, lol what times


[24-Nov-21 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	My response was to expand the permit and add moar EXT


[24-Nov-21 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	And there'e still 900 LST worth of buys I can't quite take out today


[24-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	Which represents 1/3 of the LST demand between Montem and MOR CX


[24-Nov-21 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Owch thats alot of LST


[24-Nov-21 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Nov-21 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	prom is always better because you have access to nearby market which opens up a lot of options


[25-Nov-21 05:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	later on when your logistics are maxed out. Prom is excellent as there is more traffic between the planet and exchange


[25-Nov-21 05:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	buuut..... its full so your gonna need to snipe a spot


[25-Nov-21 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	I kind of disagree on the logistics side - I think you'll find more traffic going between Verdant and Vallis than Prom and Vallis, also Verdant is mostly NCC based while you'll have to deal with ICA over on Prom


[25-Nov-21 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	Prom has slightly higher fertility though and it's closer to a CX if you need to buy / sell things locally

**collot999**:	yea, same with FEO, FE and STL


[28-Nov-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	the margins are just super skinny right now.


[28-Nov-21 11:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	however that means something like UTS is more profitable


[28-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-21 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xenogenic**:	It's funny, the last person I saw exit FE now is having trouble getting it. Spooked me a bit


[30-Nov-21 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	For real. Not exiting till I have secured consistent FE.


[30-Nov-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Not enough demand for price to go up, but too much demand to be supplied on the LM?!


[30-Nov-21 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	It weighs too much. Don't want to ship


[30-Nov-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah but its made right here on Vallis


[30-Nov-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Using 40+ per day is like a full ship load every two days.


[30-Nov-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	right!


[30-Nov-21 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I know, I made the logistics for my 4 PP1 base and said "Oh ok this just SUCKS" when I saw the 2 day shipment number


[30-Nov-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	haha. I make my own SF and FF, but don't want a ship tied down doing nothing but supplying LST and FE to Vallis


[30-Nov-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	So now I'm just following lowstrife's vertical plan (Thank you for the insight!) and smelting it myself.


[30-Nov-21 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah


[30-Nov-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Doing that currently. 1 COL, two EXT, 6 SME, and 9 PP1s


[30-Nov-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	High weight cargo would be a godsend, since you either have to import LST (Vallis) or FEO (Montem)..


[30-Nov-21 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	like to NOT make it though. pull all that up for more PP1s


[30-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah bfab market is flooded AF right now, how about you hold off mate.


[30-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	hahaha, I make them for myself


[30-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	......


[30-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	literally don't sell them at all on the CX or LM


[30-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	How?


[30-Nov-21 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Do you go through THAT MANY?!?!


[30-Nov-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	haha, repairs are a killer man, plus base expansions!


[30-Nov-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	But mostly sell to my corp mates


[30-Nov-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also: lose the COL, it sucks unless here you have like 6 ext experts..


[30-Nov-21 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	2 EXT really supplies 6 SME? That doesnt make sense..


[30-Nov-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Dude, the COL covers my O needs


[30-Nov-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Still not worth it but have fun


[30-Nov-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	it's a self sustained base except for consumables and LST


[30-Nov-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ah corp-mates, that makes sense.


[30-Nov-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	You run INC too?


[30-Nov-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	yup, on Prom


[30-Nov-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Ah okay.


[30-Nov-21 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	Forgot about that. And FLX on Montem


[30-Nov-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	...why do you want to get rid of your SME? Area costs?


[30-Nov-21 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cygal**:	pretty much. I can then tear down most of my SME, all my EXT, and make room for more PP1s


[30-Nov-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	At 220, making FE yourself may not be worth it, but I looked at lowstrife's numbers and did the math, and yeah, there is a lot of money being lost when you buy FE for 300+ prices.


[30-Nov-21 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	As one who smelts FE in mass I am hating the current prices. Its not worth me selling it at that price.


[30-Nov-21 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but the FE market is pretty saturated right now. hell over 1800 units for sale on MOR right ow


[30-Nov-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	some of that is due to the close orbits and easier shipping lately


[30-Nov-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah, I just finished stacking up on LST (at 55/u but now its 45/u thought ree) because of the close approach.


[30-Nov-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	got to get everything shipped over


[30-Nov-21 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	XD


[30-Nov-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I ran out of storage so I've stopped now


[30-Nov-21 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	2 WAR and most of my base.

**Wingeder**:	#feoheavy


[30-Nov-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	STOs are great. I just bought 500 FEO from a corp mate


[30-Nov-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I might get a STO next planet-cx conjunction, but rn I've burned through my 50k saved up cash.


[30-Nov-21 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yoikez thats alot of weight


[30-Nov-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	ill burn through it in a few days, 8 SMEs can chew through A LOT of ore, specially with 4 experts


[30-Nov-21 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I planned a 7 PP1 base, but then the price of bfabs collapsed too much


[01-Dec-21 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but that was To-392d, the PP1s actually reduce the shipping requirements


[01-Dec-21 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Dec-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	yeah, I'm tempted to put up a FS and make UTS


[01-Dec-21 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Wingeder**:	Bruh! In global we talking about CH-115a as a starting fuel planet.


[01-Dec-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Then ubermensch reminded me of CH-115b, and its a t4 world as well, but with the awesomeness of SIO and LIO in HUGEEEEEE quantities!


[01-Dec-21 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I think you should settle there and run SIO shipping to 115a for them to make MCG out of.


[01-Dec-21 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I don't really see the benefits of LIO on high tier worlds. You'd ideally ship in HAL and process it locally, and doing processing on high tier worlds kind of sucks.

**StelioKontos**:	the EMC level 1 is still about 2x as expensive as the lvl 10 SST


[01-Dec-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and, dual buildings are horrid, anyway from an efficiency perspective


[01-Dec-21 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	1 SST gives 2500 Safety, and the level 10 costs ~300k. The level 1 EMC costs ~475k and only gives 1k safety and 1k health


[01-Dec-21 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and as INF also give 2.5k health, and the level 4 INF costs ~110k, it still makes more sense to stick to the single-provider PI buildings


[01-Dec-21 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	TLDR: PI system in general needs a LOT of optimization/balancing


[01-Dec-21 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Sigh..


[01-Dec-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Dual habs also suck.. doesnt anyone know that the dual is supposed to be BETTER not worse?!


[01-Dec-21 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, I use dual habs for area optimization, but that's it

[02-Dec-21 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	For me, the bonus was maximizing the open job positions


[02-Dec-21 01:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-21 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I can definitely reserve some from the next batch for you


[02-Dec-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Long term I was actually hoping to process BER not TAI


[02-Dec-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess I could always look into making a second AML


[02-Dec-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	And my plans are somewhat fluid


[02-Dec-21 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	two weeks ago I was going to scrap the CLF, but I see there's also a HMS shortage now :(


[02-Dec-21 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I am primarily interested in doing electronics now, but I keep getting sucked into all these side ventures to guarantee supply of something or another


[02-Dec-21 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	For what it's worth I am working on the HMS shortage right now.  Waiting on shipments of IND and GCs, then I'll have another 500 or so in production


[02-Dec-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Nice


[02-Dec-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Won't have to sell all my stockpile just to prevent that market from collapsing


[02-Dec-21 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I'm making money off it


[02-Dec-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but part of me wants to re-focus on core business so I'm not constantly shipping 30 different things to each base


[02-Dec-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	this game is taking too much time to play


[02-Dec-21 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and it would be easier if I just ran like 10 copies of one line instead of 10 different lines


[02-Dec-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah there's something to be said for playing with multiples of the same base


[02-Dec-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean it's also the reason I can't really use shipping contracts


[02-Dec-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'd have to post like 30 contracts


[02-Dec-21 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	If only we had shipping containers


[02-Dec-21 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah that would be really nice


[02-Dec-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah the ability to load up a container and then ship the container would be really nice


[02-Dec-21 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	maybe they could make it where you had to construct or buy the container, and the container had some weight to it, but then you could use it


[02-Dec-21 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, honestly, I'd even use it for my own flights


[02-Dec-21 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	if I could separate out consumables for two different bases it would be a lot easier to make multiple stops


[02-Dec-21 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah that would have tons of different applications

[02-Dec-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Come to think of it.. this will become a problem soon.. the slowly overflowing FEO that escapes my 3 SME..


[02-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Japrosperous**:	Better that your ratio is slightly off in that direction at least


[02-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Yeah thats true


[02-Dec-21 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Easier to export then import almost always


[02-Dec-21 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-21 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	A whole bunch of people. I don't know their names directly, but the LM (Local Market) sometimes has listings.


[02-Dec-21 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	I make FE, but usually just for my own consumption. How much do you need? I can spare some.


[02-Dec-21 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Halfchampion**:	Let me check


[02-Dec-21 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Halfchampion**:	22


[02-Dec-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	I can spare 19 at most, but I bet if you put an ad on the LM you can get whatever you need.  (If you have PRO)


[02-Dec-21 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	Might be worth throwing up a Smelter to make it inhouse. FE is heavy to ship.


[02-Dec-21 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	If you make an LM buy for 19 FE for a total of 4750 I'll fill it.


[02-Dec-21 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Halfchampion**:	oh... ok, let me check something


[02-Dec-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is a lot of smelters here on Vallis, its probably one of the main production buildings on this planet


[02-Dec-21 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I personally have 8 and think its not enough and want to expand them


[02-Dec-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I moved away from smelting TONS of FE after the prices started crashing.


[02-Dec-21 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	letting the market breath a little bit


[02-Dec-21 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	the FE price is bonkers at the moment, I'm happy to pay 275/u for FE here on Vallis so if anyone is deciding to stop smelting FE because the price is low, consider selling to me, I need 135/day, thank you


[02-Dec-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shwippity**:	if you put up sells at 275/u people will take them


[02-Dec-21 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	making UTS conumes way more FE than PP1s. 6.2 FE per UTS


[02-Dec-21 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	my PP1s where mostly for expansions. I demo'd one already vs repairing it


[02-Dec-21 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**StelioKontos**:	I'll try to avoid taking donations for now I think - we're pretty close re: funds, and I don't want to impact anyone negatively due to this push :-)


[04-Dec-21 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Thank you for the offer though - if we end up running short I'll definitely take you up on it

[04-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	oh, nothing big - a few months ago I donated 800k to finish the planetary broadcasting hub, and we increased production fees to pay it back. Instead, I just put all of those extra funds back into population infrastructure, and am effectively erasing that 800k debt from the books

[04-Dec-21 02:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yeah, that's the major reason I'm building all of this PI in the next POPR or 2 - we'll have a UNI constructed in 2-3 weeks, so we're maxing out all of the needs to max out the growth for ENG and SCI :-)


[04-Dec-21 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'll let you know if funds run out - right now, the blocker seems to be lfabs

[04-Dec-21 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 08:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Dec-21 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rek**:	Unlike Techs and below, Engineers don't have any 'migration' growth - the only way to grow them is to have a lot of Techs educate up. So the more Tech jobs that we can create here, the faster Engineers will grow :)

**StelioKontos**:	I'm trying to get all of the fulfillment up to 100%, so we can maximize growth


[08-Dec-21 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	In addition, we need to grow out technicians as much as possible (0 open jobs currently) to maximize engineering growth, and subsequently sci


[08-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	so if anyone is considering expanding into technician-level buildings, now's the time!!


[08-Dec-21 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	It's a bit harder to get SCI on Vallis simply due to the amount of Pioneers/Settlers we have sucking up fulfillment needs


[08-Dec-21 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	That said, if we can continue working towards maxing it out, we should have awesome momentum by the time SCI start rolling in

[08-Dec-21 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Dec-21 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Haha - I have the exact same thought daily xD


[08-Dec-21 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	we damn near block out the sun, thats why the temp is below avg but the pressure is higher too much extra soot in the air


[08-Dec-21 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	and why we cant really grow much here


[08-Dec-21 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Dec-21 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	can we set up a collector and a machine to extract C and O from the CO2?


[08-Dec-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Halfchampion**:	I dunno, can we?


[08-Dec-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Halfchampion**:	also, I found a way to farm NCC


[08-Dec-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	which way? there is a ton of decent MMs to farm


[08-Dec-21 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thats the most common way. here UTS is a big one. since its just 6.2 FE through an FS


[08-Dec-21 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	I suppose I should add a bit more focus about the smog, but I did mention it a couple of times.


[09-Dec-21 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and so should make the planet hotter, even with the smoke blocking light.


[09-Dec-21 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wingeder**:	Also, speaking of which, the CO2 might actually be why this planet is so hot, considering Montem is 0.7ish AU and EVEN COLDER #wtf

[09-Dec-21 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SirCyan**:	Come see the pandas as they struggle to survive with Vallis' CO2 choked atmosphere


[09-Dec-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SirCyan**:	or is it more of a hermetically sealed wildlife park so people go to visit for the fresh air :D


[09-Dec-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is local wildlife, ones that thrive in the soot covered atmosphere. while we watch them through o2 masks


[09-Dec-21 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SirCyan**:	hmm now there's a thought, what the local wildlife looks like


[09-Dec-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	plant based?


[09-Dec-21 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

**SirCyan**:	iron based :p


[09-Dec-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well saying they breath in CO2, exhale 02 and absorb the C into their bodies to make themselves bigger


[09-Dec-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SirCyan**:	can they exhale that O2 into my steel forges please

[09-Dec-21 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-21 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-21 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but another ASM would be more along my theme


[12-Dec-21 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-21 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Dec-21 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Krags47**:	We will need tech soon


[13-Dec-21 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinbling**:	i started as manufacturer but it seems if starting here i should refocus on extracting adn smelting to make a start


[13-Dec-21 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	smelting is what vallis is made for :D


[13-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Dec-21 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Blinbling**:	and start again on vallis doing smelting from the start, and then go from there


[13-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the good news is FE is recovering


[13-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it was a lot lower a week or 2 ago


[13-Dec-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinbling**:	well even if it wasnt, i reckon its better then getting 1 H per 7hr :P


[13-Dec-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah, were you trying to make OVE?


[13-Dec-21 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Dec-21 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	try to get it on the LM instead of the CX if you can


[13-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Blinbling**:	i dumped some inventory on LM


[13-Dec-21 12:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinbling**:	for reasonably low prices i think, not so low to screw up market


[13-Dec-21 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i can just get the C right back to you later


[13-Dec-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**aeryen**:	@Blinbling price for LM ads is the total, not the per unit cost


[13-Dec-21 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yeah that should be mentioned for the rest of it, although he is liquidating soon


[13-Dec-21 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	again, the price listed is the total, not per, at aeryen mentioned


[13-Dec-21 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Blinbling**:	yeah i have corrected it, i figured it did the math for me :)


[13-Dec-21 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Dec-21 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-21 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well an FS is a good buy if you are going the metallurgy route. Allows you to take your FE and refine it farther into UTS (most of my production on all my bases is metallugy)


[16-Dec-21 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Yeah, that's where I was looking to go next. Saving up for the appropriate building parts so I can house settlers, then build the FS


[16-Dec-21 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Just need two LSE, but they aren't cheap. Smelt smelt smelt...

[16-Dec-21 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you can use the buffer MAT for any material or BUI for building


[16-Dec-21 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-21 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-21 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I didnt. my Dwarves are very specialized. We mostly do Metallurgy and Resource Extraction


[16-Dec-21 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**OyVader**:	So I've noticed... lol


[16-Dec-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	however I will say if you got pro (even just letting it exp back to basic) you can sell 99% of your FE on planet


[16-Dec-21 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	save a lot on shipping


[16-Dec-21 08:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	plus then you can take shipping contracts. allow you idle ships to make you money moving things for other players


[16-Dec-21 08:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	I've been considering it. Want to wait a bit and see how much I'm enjoying this before I throw some money at it.


[16-Dec-21 08:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	That said, even with 10 SST we're continuing to drop in safety, meaning we will need to quickly get Security Drone Posts up and running


[17-Dec-21 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I highly doubt we'll be able to support that at our current rate of production fees.... discuss!


[17-Dec-21 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Do we have a cost estimate on how much SDPs will cost?  Are we talking about raising fees by a little, or a ton?


[17-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yeah, just need to look it up... shouldn't take much - my goal is always keeping them as low as possible as you know haha


[17-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	the SDP will cost around 700k to build and the cheapest upkeep is around 4k/day cost wise


[17-Dec-21 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Haha thanks love!


[17-Dec-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I could look into philanthropic donations to build it, so we don't have to worry about the building cost as much (I'm tapped for a while after the last push)


[17-Dec-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	it's not a cheap building to run


[17-Dec-21 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, it's about 2x as expensive as the lvl 10 SST, and more expensive to maintain


[17-Dec-21 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I would be fine for a slight increase, it goes to our planet after all. and we can "win" back those taxes in suppying the upkeep/build mats ourselves


[17-Dec-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I also wouldnt mind donating to this, however im currently sitting on over 200k of big ticket items taking up space I cant move right now in OH


[17-Dec-21 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	soon™ tho


[17-Dec-21 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Yeah, I imagine the folks who make RFabs and the like won't mind.  The question remains what kind of fee raise we're talking about it.  It sounds like we need to do this sooner or later or everyone is going to have a bad day.  What kind of timeline would we be looking at Stelio?  Is this a next week project or a 30 day project?


[17-Dec-21 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, I wonder if throwing money at it would allow it to be built or if the limited factor is rfab/afab supply


[17-Dec-21 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

This auction (if we fulfill everything) should fill us up with 1 months supply of all resources we are currently supplying, with a bit of excess income.

**collot999**:	OyVader, FE is better for making money fast, but you can get more profit from steel if you can wait for the extra time to produce it and the trading speed


[18-Dec-21 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	right now, with current O and STL prices, I'd reccomend you selling FE

[18-Dec-21 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	With current O prices, if you gather O here and sell it in the commodity exchange, your profit would be 50-60NCC for each unit of O sold.


[18-Dec-21 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Dec-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Good to know!


[18-Dec-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	if you haven't paid, and they haven't delivered, the contract gets cancelled at no detriment to either party


[18-Dec-21 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	No way to take them to court, I assume? lol


[18-Dec-21 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	haha outside of warning others on discord or here, not really :P


[18-Dec-21 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Well, they've got an A rating, so I probably didn't just throw 10K down a hole...


[18-Dec-21 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	yeah, in that case I'd just extend it!


[18-Dec-21 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Didn't know I could do that...


[18-Dec-21 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Yeah, after the deadline exceeds, you'll have 24 hours to extend the contract by 1d - and you can repeat that indefinitely :-)


[18-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	Cool. I'm sure it's fine. I just realized that I plunked down a chunk of change before they provisioned and got nervous. No biggie.


[18-Dec-21 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**OyVader**:	(Yes, I'm still new...)


[18-Dec-21 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Everything is updated on the finances sheet for current population infrastructure. At current setup (with 1 SDP), we'll need to be pulling in approximately 650k/week to break even


[18-Dec-21 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Our current weekly average is growing, and is a bit over 450k/week


[18-Dec-21 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	For those that are curious as to how we're reaching this number: This is fulfilling 3/4 for ART, 2/5 for PBH, 4/5 for PAR, 3/4 for SDP. Moving up from there it gets considerably more expensive


[18-Dec-21 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Dec-21 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Dec-21 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Dec-21 02:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Maximoose**:	Yeah I've been trying to, not a lot of margin on the markets so transport seems to be the best income


[20-Dec-21 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kuben**:	If you have a idle ship, there is usually a lot of contracts going from Promitor --> Vallis. They will pay you roundtrips since it is mostly one way


[20-Dec-21 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Maximoose**:	I saw some from Hyperion that I've got another ship running now

Vallis: (Still) Bursting at the seams!
Hey Vallis! That time again. Since our last poll, we've completed 3 Wildlife Parks, 3 Art Galleries, 4 Infirmaries, and the maximum amount of safety stations that are allowed. Oh yeah - and that University! Also, the aforementioned loans that Vallis owed for the PBH are all taken care of. A special thanks to everyone who assisted in getting this...

**CapitanIncognito**:	Do we have an estimate of how many weeks we are from having a sci?


[22-Dec-21 01:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	It largely depends on how well we can keep up with the current fulfillment needs - there's no migration factor applied for anything above technicians, so the primary concern is maximizing technician happiness, so that we can grow engineers as fast as possible.


[22-Dec-21 01:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'm working on figuring out what upkeep we can provide to the UNI to get an edu bonus as well - I imagine scientist happiness should rise above 75% in the next 3 to 4 weeks, so maybe by then?


[22-Dec-21 01:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	I'll work on getting a more finite estimate :-)


[22-Dec-21 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	That said, I'm a bit worried about the supply of a few upkeep materials, if anyone is looking for expansion ideas..

[22-Dec-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Upkeep material quantities are pretty monumental now, so I'm wondering whether we should switch to a single price reverse market for upkeep materials - we can come up with a formula that depends on the CX price, and then I can keep a separate buffer of materials up to say, 45 days supply


[22-Dec-21 02:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	That way anyone can participate, and I can keep track of folks that sell less often than others to make sure everyone gets a piece of the pie. Thoughts?


[22-Dec-21 02:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	There might even be opportunity to leverage the CX for this in some cases, depending on current supply


[22-Dec-21 02:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**OyVader**:	How do the auctions work?


[22-Dec-21 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	@OyVader you join the discord which Stelio can send you a link too.  There are instructions for each auction.  The basic process is you send in your bid encrypted, then when the auction is closed validate the bid.  Winners are determined by the lowest cost supplier but the final price paid is the "first losing" bid price.  It's a great way to make some cash if you're operating in areas that Vallis needs

[22-Dec-21 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**collot999**:	Here on vallis I calculated production prices for O are around 27NCC/u

Vickrey Auction
A Vickrey auction is a sealed-bid auction where bidders submit bids without knowing the bids of other people. However, as opposed to other sealed-bid

[23-Dec-21 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	one you've read that, it's very simple... we use our discord bot to facilitate accepting/verifying bids


[23-Dec-21 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and technically our auction is a "reverse-auction" - so rather than bidding to buy a certain good, your bidding on a price to sell certain goods at


[23-Dec-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	so in this case, rather than the highest bid winning (like a normal auction), in a reverse auction the lowest bids win


[23-Dec-21 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	You're affectively saying "I'm willing to sell you x MAT for $total" when you place a bid


[23-Dec-21 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	That said, I'm thinking of moving to a more open-reverse-market model, so everyone can participate without worrying about auction timings, availability, etc


[23-Dec-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	As upkeep quantities are skyrocketing, it makes more sense to have a system like this than periodic material injections (current auctions)


[23-Dec-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	So over this next week, I'll be playing around with creating an inventory sheet everyone can look at to determine what we need


[23-Dec-21 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	and we'll use an algorithm dependent on CX pricing to determine the purchase price

[03-Jan-22 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	so anyone can look at those and see what's available to sell, and depending on the material, we might even be able to leverage the LM for non-pro players


[03-Jan-22 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	The current list is available here, on the Vallis Procurement Shop tab... it's still a work in progress, but prices/quantites are up

[11-Jan-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	i fly vallis > moria 480/480 free throw up some contracts


[11-Jan-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	wow i think the smog around vallis will clear up with those O prices


[11-Jan-22 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	140/u


[11-Jan-22 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jan-22 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	135/u


[11-Jan-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	still way to expensive for a mat that only requieres upkeep transport and basic Folder


[11-Jan-22 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	*food


[11-Jan-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	@nocknuck is the ship still docked or is it en route already


[11-Jan-22 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	that ship has sailed long ago sorry


[11-Jan-22 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	all good, I just woke up and got on


[11-Jan-22 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is no hurry on the stuff


[11-Jan-22 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Yep, most primary resources are very expensive, btw, O is no different from H or other gases or ores.


[11-Jan-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	just got to know the people who harvest it en mass. I get my O pretty damn cheap compared to the CX.


[11-Jan-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	yes o is as expensive as h is valid but you can harvest o from normal planets


[11-Jan-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	for h you need atleast aef and ins


[11-Jan-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	true. Best O near Moria is on Verdant and people prefer to grow food there and don't build collectors. Shipping is also a big pain.


[11-Jan-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	shipping is the big bottleneck


[11-Jan-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but im sure you can get an entire shipload of O (438u) for less than 30k (68.5/u) if you buy it locally and ship it yourself


[11-Jan-22 12:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I get it through a corp mate so we have special pricing. but im sure they would be more than happy to sell at that price for open market. (tho i cant speak for them exactly)


[11-Jan-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	There used to be sell ads for O at MM buy prices on LM when I started, but not anymore. There is 1 buy ad for a low price rn, it must be one of corp ads. I didn't notice people selling O recently there. I think most ship it straight to Montem or Vallis or elsewhere.


[11-Jan-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if you tossed a buy ad up on Verdant it would get filled pretty quickly. at least faster than you can get a ship there


[11-Jan-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	At prices above 100/u, it's better to ship to cx.


[11-Jan-22 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	I think.


[11-Jan-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is a shipping calculations that need to be handled. thats why I said a shipload. the fuel costs split between over 400 units on O gets reduced quite a bit.


[11-Jan-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if you only buying 10-100 O at a time it wouild be better just to do the CX at higher prices


[11-Jan-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	or see if you can get it on planet for cheap too


[11-Jan-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but Vallis's O collection rates are pretty crap


[11-Jan-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	not completely worthless. but will do in a pinch. I did it for a good bit when i first started out


[11-Jan-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I also extracted my own FEO too. but now my base here is pure Metallurgy.


[11-Jan-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Well, you said 30k for a shipload - 438 O plus round trip Verdant MOR ~8k: 38k/438=86.75/u.


[11-Jan-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	Current price at cx is 135/u. I think, people sell on LM what they don't want to ship.


[11-Jan-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I know a few people who actually backed up because they had sooo much.. xD can only ship soo fast


[11-Jan-22 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	yeah. :)


[11-Jan-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there was a time where one person offered just below CP if you could come get it asap to drain their stocks


[11-Jan-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**blueGeek**:	especially if storage fills up and production stops.


[11-Jan-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	selling slightly below even prices is better than idle machines

**CapitanIncognito**:	O is not like H. You can't put 500 on a ship :(


[11-Jan-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You can put 300+ H on some shipments that are heavy but not bulky


[11-Jan-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	there's a lot fewer things that are the opposite


[11-Jan-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you can fit 438 O on 1 ship.


[11-Jan-22 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	and yes, filling a hold with FE/O, STL, CU/O or AU/O and H is a nice way to go

**Lorddirt**:	Really hate these taxes, whole production went offline overnight because I didn't realise I was low on money


[12-Jan-22 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	I need to start keeping more excess money on hand


[12-Jan-22 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lorddirt**:	Alright, maybe that's a strong word. It's just pretty annoying to me to realise that only having 1k on hand isn't going to cut it anymore for production


[12-Jan-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well depends on your base size


[12-Jan-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I had almost 11k in production fees last period and almost 5k in transaction fees


[12-Jan-22 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	Unemployment is super high for Pioneers, Settlers and even Technicians, do we really need these high taxes?


[13-Jan-22 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	I think so, yes, if we wanna get to SCI at a somewhat decent pace


[13-Jan-22 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	is there a way to see the fee breakdown?


[13-Jan-22 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	or I'm pretty sure there is, but how do I do that?


[13-Jan-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Agree with Rubicate, they are pretty high - I wonder if dropping them would reduce some of the consumable prices and entice more players to start here


[13-Jan-22 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'm of mixed minds since the hope is to raise funds for further infrastructure for higher tiers, but that doesn't help the new players who want to settle here and are not using the higher tiers


[13-Jan-22 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yeah, just like ethically speaking, the people that benefit should be the ones paying for the new infrastructure, but taxes indiscriminantly uses everyone to pay for it


[13-Jan-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	devs are supposed to be working on individual taxes per tier


[13-Jan-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	that would be really beneficial


[13-Jan-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Oh absolutely, but until then, I'm not sure I'm satisfied with 'just suck it up and wait', ya know?


[13-Jan-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah that's fair


[13-Jan-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	The taxes of the many cranked up to serve the eventual goals of a select few? Leaves a sour taste in my mouth too :P


[13-Jan-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Now, I would be more in favor of a specialized COGC with higher taxes, but lower taxes for those that dont benefit from it


[13-Jan-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I could get behind that potentially


[13-Jan-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	it's again just benefiting that particular category but if we could set taxes on that category higher it would balance it some maybe?


[13-Jan-22 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	leverage those who are specializing to pay for higher tier infrastructure while not penalizing those that are new and benefit less from it


[13-Jan-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	For example--higher taxes on metallurgy as there is a significant part of vallis that runs SME and FS


[13-Jan-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	use those funds to propel the infrastructure planning while tax cutting new players and those in other industries


[13-Jan-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	You do realise that FE isn't worth a dime this universe?


[13-Jan-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Opinions vary


[13-Jan-22 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Smelting FE for selling is not worth the trouble at this price


[13-Jan-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	ALO does seem to have the advantage but no ALO here on Vallis


[13-Jan-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	berthier is the AL powerhouse I believe


[13-Jan-22 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as one of the best planets to smelt on (regardless of the value in smelting) it makes sense to maximize its potential and use that as a springboard for progress


[13-Jan-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Not really. I can move my FEO to some other planet without/or lower taxes and smelt it there, especially when ships with WCB come available. That's what I did last universe anyway


[13-Jan-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	cargo...FEO?


[13-Jan-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	Perhaps we are talking about 2 different levels of scale here.


[13-Jan-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	But looking at some planets taxes : Promitor : 20 ICA / Montem : 35 NCC / Vallis : 60 NCC. That's really out of bound.


[13-Jan-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Rubi, I'm just mentioning people could move ore around if they want too


[13-Jan-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	I mean, what good are scientist / engineers etc when you are just smelting Iron ?


[13-Jan-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Doesn't like 90 iron fill up a ship


[13-Jan-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Idk if I'd call that moveable XD


[13-Jan-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	But yet, those metallurgy people will get taxed higer to improve the planet ( that they won't have use for )


[13-Jan-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	63 to be exact


[13-Jan-22 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	and I did move FE to montem as I had a planet full of PP1 there ;)


[13-Jan-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Thaun that's true, but they will have more a benefit from those higher taxes (metallurgy COGS)


[13-Jan-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	I would be of the opinion that smelting should have a lower tax rate than the rest then, because I'm sure that 10/10 smelter players don't care about the higher popi


[13-Jan-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	indeed


[13-Jan-22 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	but that's not what Shadowsneak mentioned above


[13-Jan-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	He said that smelting is the biggest thing on Vallis, so they will be taxed the most to pay for the higher popi


[13-Jan-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	*In conjunction with a Metalurgy COGS


[13-Jan-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	taxed for popi they don't use :|


[13-Jan-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	That will not happen


[13-Jan-22 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	pioneers are very cheap


[13-Jan-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Most people vote for pioneers on CoGc


[13-Jan-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Sure but it could! With the power of hope and belief and fair taxes for everyone


[13-Jan-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	wut


[13-Jan-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	that's not true


[13-Jan-22 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	?


[13-Jan-22 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Are you looking at the same screen I am?


[13-Jan-22 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Thuan**:	22.5 now ;)


[13-Jan-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	@Thaun there are basically two options - drop taxes because they're super high and most people aren't benefitting for them, or keep them the same and put them on a select group of the population that benefits more from a different COGS


[13-Jan-22 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I was only proposing it as a creative solution to get similar money from a smaller group of people


[13-Jan-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	The best option is to let the corp/people that wants the higher tier population , pay for it.


[13-Jan-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	doesnt mean its the nest solution


[13-Jan-22 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I agree Thuan, that is ideal


[13-Jan-22 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	That means taxing the professions that will have use for those higher pop


[13-Jan-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Is there a way to specifically target those sectors without hitting people downstream?


[13-Jan-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	When the higher tier pop exists, that structure makes sense. Transiently, taxes are higher to grow those populations


[13-Jan-22 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	So to alleviate high taxes to everyone, that was where the COGC focused tax idea came from (as a short term play)


[13-Jan-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Imho, things like Resource Extraction, metallurgy, Fuel Refining should never be taxed ( or milked ) to pay for higher tier population, as they won't benefit ( much ) on them


[13-Jan-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I mean just from an ethical perspective, Vallis is a starter planet, we have an obligation to help new players have an easier time here and the distance to the CX already makes it really difficult (I had to Coliq after starting on Vallis), so we should be doing everything else in our power to make it easier (i.e. low tax rates on exactly the things Thuan mentioned)


[13-Jan-22 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	you should run on Vallis Thuan


[13-Jan-22 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	you have my vote


[13-Jan-22 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheEnvoy**:	+1


[13-Jan-22 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	Well, maybe someday. Lacking time in real life actually.... Last universe I had more time, and maybe put a bit too much time in prun back then.


[13-Jan-22 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	If you ever get the time, you should! As someone who almost quit this game when I first started because of how difficult Vallis was to survive on, I think your line of reasoning would go a long way to making things a bit more fair and just.


[13-Jan-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	It's not that Vallis is being governed badly, just expensive and maybe not the right planet for their plans for higher tier popi


[13-Jan-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Thuan**:	speaking of not much time.... need to pick up the kids from school and drive them to hobbies, feed them, etc... :D


[13-Jan-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Yeah exactly! Slapping starter planet on something adds a level of duty


[13-Jan-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Jan-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Well Stelios did put out several questionnaires about the Tax Plans before the last few increases. Asking what people wanted and where comfortable with


[13-Jan-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I saw one about 12 hours before they changed


[13-Jan-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	and its not a critique of a person


[13-Jan-22 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	its a critique of the game mechanic


[13-Jan-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	if an AAF and a BMP always pay the same in tax per time


[13-Jan-22 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	obviously the bmp will be unprofitable first


[13-Jan-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	and its not like stelios can do anything about it, hes just trying to push the game mechanic to a place it probably wasnt envisioned going


[13-Jan-22 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	and on a starter world, that probably isnt the best for player retention


[13-Jan-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I also dont recall anything on that questionare about doubling taxes


[13-Jan-22 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I thought the top was like 50%


[13-Jan-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	and he doubled it


[13-Jan-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	so I dont know how he came up with those numbers


[13-Jan-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**collot999**:	I know the fees on production are based on a fixed amount every 24h of production or the ones of local market that is a fixed starter amount with a second fee for every day that the offer keeps on. But I don’t know what taxes you mean that are based on a percentage.

**parafort**:	@CraneArmy the tax is on every BMP on the planet. so it should just increase the cost and therefore the price of it's products.


[13-Jan-22 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	price isnt determined by one planet


[13-Jan-22 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	but it doesnt really matter, the point stands, the way the game implements the system, must always be regressive


[13-Jan-22 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	even if it effected every bmp in the system the same, it must effect bmp's more than aaf's

**StelioKontos**:	Yeah, it's a pain that it requires this much in order to maintain upkeep. That said, I use all of the gained funds to purchase things from people here on Vallis

[16-Jan-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Jan-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	so, just a not to everyone to reset your queues if you use those

**Koibu**:	Any new players looking to use one of their ships to make some good money? Look no further than the LM! You'll see a lucrative shipping ad for picking up a load of ALO in Celebdil, and bringing it back here!

[27-Jan-22 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-22 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	are these shipping contracts?


[27-Jan-22 07:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you trail so I assume you bought stuff on the CX? if thats the case you can use the CONT tab or turn on SDBR. as for picking them up you need to fly you ship to the CX that the goods are waiting on,

**Maces**:	LF 4 LBH


[28-Jan-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I think it'd be cool to be able to post shipping ads as the shipper. Like flying this route with this much space, asking certain price per unit, and then people can just fill pay and add cargo to it


[28-Jan-22 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I have a ship running Vallis to Montem here shortly with 480/480 space, anyone need anything moved?

[28-Jan-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jan-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Private contracts. Yes, hard agree.

**PawnStorm**:	Well I may have voted a week ago and forgotten :) Logged in this morning to find 14 idle SMEs due to a lack of FEO wasting the CoGC bonus.

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	ooof


[29-Jan-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I have a ton of CUO I can sell ya XD


[29-Jan-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	(or if anyone else here wants some CUO feel free to ask me)


[29-Jan-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I would like some


[29-Jan-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	ill do 180/u here. I currently have 300 available


[29-Jan-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	(more constantly coming)


[29-Jan-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Ok let me see what can buy


[29-Jan-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	how much I meant


[29-Jan-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Ok I will buy 110


[29-Jan-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	toss an ad up, or do you need me to


[29-Jan-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I will


[29-Jan-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Got it thanks


[29-Jan-22 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	enjoy that Fine Dwarven™ CUO


[29-Jan-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Cool


[29-Jan-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	let me know if/when you need more


[29-Jan-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	Metallurgy for the win


[29-Jan-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	holy crap, I dont recall the last time I was below 5k weight in my storage


[29-Jan-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	lol I know right


[29-Jan-22 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I have 3 STOs here. usually sit somewhere between 8-13k


[29-Jan-22 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	So, with these wonderful metallurgy bonuses, does it make sense to consider an alternating COGC? 50/50 Pio/Metallurgy?


[29-Jan-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that way the FEO doesnt run dry all the time


[29-Jan-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but there is a lot of other PIO industries here. I think 3 PIO 1 MET would probably be best


[29-Jan-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I think we recently lost a big FEO miner here. the market has been getting dry, I used to be able to buy 1k at a time


[29-Jan-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	FEO is just heavy. No one wants to hold it


[29-Jan-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	But since FEO is going to be in high demand. I am going to invest in extraction


[29-Jan-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	whatever its gunna be, dont change it every week


[29-Jan-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	if I didnt see this one, it would have thrown off like 4 production lines


[29-Jan-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	I usually just vote for it every week. Didn't realize it was actually gonna happen


[29-Jan-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	democracy is aweful


[29-Jan-22 05:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SR5473**:	It's a nice change might help with shipbuilding


[29-Jan-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	itll help me too, but what doesnt help me is having 4 lines go offline


[29-Jan-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-22 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	o?


[31-Jan-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	we'll have to figure out how we plan on selecting the weekly program - whether I just try to optimise, or whether we put it to a vote


[31-Jan-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	then what about all the upkeep goods


[31-Jan-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Jan-22 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	what do you want to fill?


[04-Feb-22 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	im sure some might drop their order down if someone can fill imediately


[04-Feb-22 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	ive had a few orders up with low rating and people took the full 3 day to fill. even tho that is usually just left as a default


[04-Feb-22 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	in general, I'm still starting up my production of FE, STL, and UTS


[04-Feb-22 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	so it may take me a week or two to get my production up to speed


[04-Feb-22 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well also in a week or 2 (dont know how long you have had pro) but your P rating will fall off after a little while


[04-Feb-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	i dont have pro lol only basic haha


[04-Feb-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	RedWolf StarMetals has only been around for a week after all


[04-Feb-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	and i just joined back in the game about 4 days ago


[04-Feb-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well you got the green name


[04-Feb-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	oh I did not realize i was back that long haha


[04-Feb-22 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	i used to be pro but not now


[04-Feb-22 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	all good, but once you get a letter grade in each category you will no longer be P


[04-Feb-22 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	my last one is stability lol


[04-Feb-22 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	yay boo me lol


[04-Feb-22 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	what is usually the good ratio to have when producing UTS? I have 4 ext, two sme, and soon will put up FS is the ratio good enough or should I increase the ratio to ensure constant production for FE, SPK, STL, and UTS?


[04-Feb-22 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if just making UTS (and some SFK) you will need more SMEs


[04-Feb-22 03:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	thank you for the advice :)


[04-Feb-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you can say a FS needs around 1 FE/hr to make UTS (least when you get experts)


[04-Feb-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	oh wow thats a lot fe :P


[04-Feb-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thats my speed


[04-Feb-22 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	interesting speed hahaha


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I also have 5 metallurgy experts and both luxuries filled


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	so I'll need two more sme then


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	and I have one lux filled


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	1 UTS = 6.2 FE


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	but as I just started back in the game, I need time to get up to production speed I want


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	who are the usual buyers for UTS?


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	.2 FE as SFK


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	MM mostly


[04-Feb-22 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**RedChoasWolf92**:	understand I just cmae back to this game after a year hubris


[04-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	oh interesting


[04-Feb-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	and how does hse related?


[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	This was actually a response to a conversation hours ago


[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The planet only has two scientists


[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	what is HSE used for


[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and 3 people trying to hire them


[04-Feb-22 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	HSE is for settling high pressure worlds


[04-Feb-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	ah catcha


[04-Feb-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	surprised that it is very slow to get more scientist on here


[04-Feb-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean most worlds have 0


[04-Feb-22 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Circe I think is the only one with "lots"


[04-Feb-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	By which I mean 66


[04-Feb-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	so... a lot more than 2


[04-Feb-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	where is circe


[04-Feb-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	nice job snf lol


[04-Feb-22 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	so why is the governor not encouraging more popi growth in the higher teir?


[04-Feb-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Vallis is way ahead of the starter worlds


[04-Feb-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but money really


[04-Feb-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	a large pioneer pop and lots of small bases eat up a lot of it


[04-Feb-22 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the CoGC maintenance is expensive


[04-Feb-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	that makes sense :O


[04-Feb-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The other issue is the free rider problem


[04-Feb-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	I'm a small base lol mostly focusing on production of FE, AL, TI, STL, SFK, and UTS


[04-Feb-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	free rider


[04-Feb-22 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	?


[04-Feb-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	like I would be willing to pay a lot for more popi if I could be guaranteed the extra workers from it


[04-Feb-22 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	like scientist popi?


[04-Feb-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah


[04-Feb-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I  donated 600 TUB to the UNI's upkeep


[04-Feb-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	holy smokes!


[04-Feb-22 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and I think the university cost like 1 million?


[04-Feb-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	dang


[04-Feb-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	wow


[04-Feb-22 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	we need to import sh** load from that waterful planet


[04-Feb-22 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GhostXD**:	I think most governors break even, or make negative profit


[04-Feb-22 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[04-Feb-22 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Feb-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Feb-22 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-22 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	Rek in SNF sells them. Aprrox 550-600k for the LHP version.


[08-Feb-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	GTU can do them as well, but we're booked for probably a month right now on them


[08-Feb-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-22 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lovehungusall**:	I wouldn't touch the PBH, absolute crap of a PoPI building


[09-Feb-22 04:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	is the Art Gallery our best bet to raise culture then?


[09-Feb-22 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	cost wise yes


[09-Feb-22 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	They really need to rebalance all POPI buildings to make the "Big" building worth it over the small ones


[09-Feb-22 04:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	and split buildings are never ever worth it to build


[09-Feb-22 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'm assuming upkeep would probably be enough to at least bring culture back up


[09-Feb-22 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yea, filling up all 4 upkeep would bring us to max if we weren't capped by by the stuff before it


[09-Feb-22 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	I'm not even sure if taxes can cover that right now tho, that is really costly


[09-Feb-22 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, I guess it's all somewhat questionable if we can buy scientists


[09-Feb-22 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	You will still likely need PoPI to keep those bought SCI, just not as much


[09-Feb-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	wow, that art gallery upkeep is not friendly at all


[09-Feb-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I could see myself contributing 2/6 to the PBH, but the ART is almost entirely beyond me


[09-Feb-22 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	except maybe if I were to buy UTS at MM price


[09-Feb-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	interesting, I am working on producing UTS.


[09-Feb-22 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the real issue is I don't know how much money I want to throw at getting more scientists on a planet where I'm not actually guaranteed to get those scientists


[09-Feb-22 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	I just need to put up a barraak, a FS, and maybe two more SME


[09-Feb-22 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	are sci that important for this planet?


[09-Feb-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean, getting another FTL is critical to me if I'm to keep playing this game


[09-Feb-22 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	It requires too much interaction otherwise


[09-Feb-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	well for anyone who has basic, that will be impossible to get another ship


[09-Feb-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	if you have pro then you can build a another ship


[09-Feb-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	that is a big barrier for non paying players


[09-Feb-22 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	from what I understand


[09-Feb-22 07:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean without scientists, it's impossible to get that other ship


[09-Feb-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	with 1 scientist it will take me about 7 months


[09-Feb-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Feb-22 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	pfft


[09-Feb-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	most of the UTS made is sold to the MM


[09-Feb-22 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its a good dump for FE


[09-Feb-22 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	was the SCI immigration funded by the tax revenue?


[16-Feb-22 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	because I do agree it isn't fair to put the bill for bringing in SCI at the foot of lower tiers, especially since they aren't seeing any benefit from those SCI


[16-Feb-22 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Stelios just has been very busy with RL lately, so probably hasnt tweeked them much yet.


[16-Feb-22 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but I agree, SCI should be taxed higher to compensate for all the infrastructure that went into them.


[16-Feb-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Personally I dont really ever seeing Dwarven SCIs in the future


[16-Feb-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	(no metallurgy buildings that high)


[16-Feb-22 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lovehungusall**:	yes Stelios has a new job, moving and all that, so he has been very busy


[16-Feb-22 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Personally I think Stelios has done a great job until recently. I think that this recent RL events shouldn't weigh down his accomplishments and organizations too much.


[16-Feb-22 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Life is more important than a video game - if he comes back in a few days and apologizes / sets more reasonable taxes I'm content


[16-Feb-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	^exactly


[16-Feb-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thus my message to kind of quiet down the rioters that seemed forming. "Everyone, put down your pitchforks. It will all work out in the end"


[16-Feb-22 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	LOl


[16-Feb-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	I mean I think it's hilarious I'm the only person that's not GTU or SNF in this conversation


[16-Feb-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	LOL


[16-Feb-22 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well those to corps have a decent % of the plots on this planet.

**CraneArmy**:	thatsthepoint.jpg


[16-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	not trying to call out Stelio at all, and if he is busy in RL then that absolutely takes priority over the game here


[16-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	just was wondering if he had plans to alter them all


[16-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and didn't know he was busy IRL, but that makes sense


[16-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	just looking for some clarity


[16-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	he was present enough to change the pios to 45 when the update came through


[16-Feb-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	which is the kind of token breadcrumbs the plebs should expect


[16-Feb-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CraneArmy**:	I'm saying its just how democracy works


[16-Feb-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	We're playing Space Excel not deciding the role workers have in the means of production


[16-Feb-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	it should be the expectation


[16-Feb-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	this is an important civics lesson


[16-Feb-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Thanks dad


[16-Feb-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	your mom says hi


[16-Feb-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheDoctor1786**:	Oof, take me to the burn ward


[16-Feb-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its also a new system. It will take some time to get things dialed in.


[16-Feb-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	totally agree


[16-Feb-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and as always, if anyone thinks they can do better, we do hold elections regularly for the role of governor


[16-Feb-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Ill PM him and let him know of the conversation and get some answers.


[16-Feb-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	my intention wasn't to say Stelio isn't doing a good job but just to look for further info


[16-Feb-22 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and for the record, Stelio, I am happy to offer some contributions to upkeep and immigration of higher tiers if that would help make lower tier taxes more affordable


[16-Feb-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Relayed message from Stelio (working and cant log in) "Cool, I'll go ahead and lower the PIO taxes to minimum, so people are happy. I've got plenty to fill in the gap, and then later when we know how much were missing, we can all discuss the higher tiers" these changes will probably happen sometime this evening (USA)


[16-Feb-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedChoasWolf92**:	anyone produces EXo and PT? I would like to buy some


[16-Feb-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	Thanks Butane, for looking into that and reaching out


[16-Feb-22 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	@RedChaosWolf92 how many are you looking for?


[16-Feb-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	NP. RL can be a bitch sometimes.


[16-Feb-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Ive worked too many jobs where I worked 60-80hrs a week and just vanish


[16-Feb-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah too many other things in life take precedence over a game


[16-Feb-22 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	well I guess not too many other things, but I mean the game shouldn't take priority over real life stuff


[16-Feb-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	The idea of being able to run a government as a group with a separate account for tax revenue and such would be really nice, so if one person is busy others might be available to help out here and there


[16-Feb-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	it's just so much easier financially to be a separate solo corp to run it


[16-Feb-22 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	a council you could say


[16-Feb-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	all funds needs to be voted on. But since time zones and stuff can get a little crazy coordination can be a little tricky at times


[16-Feb-22 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	would be interesting to see however

[16-Feb-22 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I was thinking that was something they were working on for governments, the ability to have the funds separate from your regular funds, so councils/groups could be more feasible

**MadMonk21**:	welcome! glad to have you join us here on Vallis!


[16-Feb-22 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	Really excited, certainly a lot of information to take in on Apex. Hoping to get up to speed quick, we'll see how it goes :p


[16-Feb-22 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	well I say dig in and see what you can figure out, and feel free to reach out with any questions you might have. Lots of people here are willing to help or talk with you about things


[16-Feb-22 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and this game is kind of get started and then wait for things to be produced


[16-Feb-22 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	and if you get into it a few days and decide you don't like the direction you're going, you can restart pretty easily


[16-Feb-22 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	Production queues full, shipping contract in progress, and purchase ads placed. I've been looking for something like this that's kind of "as involved as you make it"

**GhostXD**:	Nice


[16-Feb-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Hey folks! Sorry I've been awol - I went ahead and lowered all PIO taxes to 10 ncc, and haven't adjusted any of the other fees. I'll be moving and transitioning to a new job over the next two weeks, but will still try to get on and maintain upkeep!


[16-Feb-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StelioKontos**:	Things should calm down by the end of February (fingers crossed)


[16-Feb-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-22 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-22 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	yes


[21-Feb-22 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	oooh, good to know. Got a pro license today and I'm still figuring out everything.


[21-Feb-22 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	nice, I got my license two days after starting. Liked the game that much.


[21-Feb-22 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Same for me, it felt like the part of eve online I wanted to do all that time, but without spending 8 hours a day 3 days a week to do it.


[21-Feb-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	yep, or getting ganked. I son't miss getting ganked.


[21-Feb-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	*don't


[21-Feb-22 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	God does this man understand me


[21-Feb-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	lol


[21-Feb-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	The first day I got a plex, a friend gave me the isk for a retriever and we went to get some trit


[21-Feb-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	and 15 mins later some dude ganked it


[21-Feb-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	yep


[21-Feb-22 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	then I wouldn't fly without a procurer


[21-Feb-22 07:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	yep, I went into Nullsec. Last mistake I ever made in that game.


[21-Feb-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	I used to live in WHs for a whole summer. My uni/sleep life was fucked


[21-Feb-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Played from 11am to 5pm, then from 9pm to 4am every day


[21-Feb-22 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	The paranoia that place gave me was insane.


[21-Feb-22 07:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	WH was fun. Nullsec was alright if someone had the right alliance. I just wanted to mine and not be ganked for it. lol


[21-Feb-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Even then, if you went to mine in nullsec it felt like either you used a rorq or you sucked


[21-Feb-22 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	I maxed my orca skills for hs mining then left.


[21-Feb-22 07:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	I had an Orca for a longtime. Never lost it. Ice mining in Jerma was my way of relaxing for the day.


[21-Feb-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	The thing that bothered me (and that even started worrying my partner) about eve is that you feel the need to make more isk than what the sub cost you,


[21-Feb-22 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	So it turns into an addiction real fast. Was it like that for you too?

[21-Feb-22 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-22 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	welp, I've officially done my first coliq


[21-Feb-22 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Oof how come?


[21-Feb-22 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	I was in a low-liquidity situation that was a little unfortunate for my future plans and mostly just wanted to restart in an industry I liked the "natural" progression of better


[21-Feb-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	What industry was that?


[21-Feb-22 08:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	We might have done the same thing a few hours apart ahah


[21-Feb-22 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	I was in construction, now I'm in manufacturing


[21-Feb-22 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Sweet! What do you produce?


[21-Feb-22 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	I was in manufacturing, but moved to metallurgy


[21-Feb-22 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	Right now just basic PE; low effort and always in demand. My initial impulse is to move into electronics eventually, but I've only got a basic feel of the market thus far


[21-Feb-22 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	Course, I'm trying to get production to 100% atm, if anyone's looking to sell PWO and/or COF, I'm flexible on price ;)


[21-Feb-22 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	I don't have either of those sadly


[21-Feb-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Manufacturors usually have a harvester for oxygen, right?


[21-Feb-22 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	You wouldn't happen to have one of those by any chance?


[21-Feb-22 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	it's running hydrogen right now, but yes


[21-Feb-22 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Ooh, because I need oxygen to fuel my smelter and I was hoping to find a local source. :)

[21-Feb-22 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	I sent you a dm


[21-Feb-22 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Welcome to Vallis!


[21-Feb-22 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	careful running those collectors on H, that's risky business


[21-Feb-22 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	oh yeah? limited resources, or not worth the effort?


[21-Feb-22 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	H on vallis is almost a trace resource


[21-Feb-22 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I made PE on vallis almost a year ago, it was horrible


[21-Feb-22 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	Lol, I noticed it wouldn't be enough to run full time production


[21-Feb-22 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	now that the gas giants are up, its almost not even viable.


[21-Feb-22 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Running O on vallis is almost reasonable, but its better to do on Montem or Verdant


[21-Feb-22 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	vallis is very much a smelters dream, with the FEO deposits, planet bonus to 25% smelting and metalworking doing anything else is extra difficult


[21-Feb-22 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Do you know if there are many carbon farmers on Vallis?


[21-Feb-22 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i too was once one


[21-Feb-22 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	farming on vallis is difficult


[21-Feb-22 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	no natural water source, and poor fertility


[21-Feb-22 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it can be done, i farmed GRN to make into C, and collected O, bought FLX and became a smelter


[21-Feb-22 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	oof, then I guess I'll have to import my carbon


[21-Feb-22 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	C is very heavy, you can only fit 222 into a ship, but in the early game it isnt too bad


[21-Feb-22 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	sometimes buying local market C can be better, especially when the CX is far away


[21-Feb-22 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the game is a lot of trial and error, some people like that, it took me 4-5 months to learn what was good and not good lol


[21-Feb-22 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but it certainly doesnt have to be that way


[21-Feb-22 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	I'm asking around a lot to figure it out


[21-Feb-22 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	I coliqed on day 3


[21-Feb-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i probably should have


[21-Feb-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Turns out manufacturing isn't only producing complex goods


[21-Feb-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	I needed to actually harvest stuff


[21-Feb-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	making OVE on Katoa is one of the easiest starts for manufactuing


[21-Feb-22 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	well darn


[21-Feb-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	they are actually excessively overproduced down there


[21-Feb-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so much that the price is always low


[21-Feb-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	Is Katoa far?


[21-Feb-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	in Benton


[21-Feb-22 09:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	so, not close


[21-Feb-22 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GingerDanger**:	6 jumps away


[21-Feb-22 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	OVE.NC1


[21-Feb-22 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	OVE.CI1


[21-Feb-22 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	oh wow, OVE finally went back up


[21-Feb-22 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	must be the new player influx


[21-Feb-22 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	well I chose to manufacture on Vallis because I'm a patriot. Gonna look at what's most profitable to focus on, but any suggestions?


[21-Feb-22 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	besides FE, most of the other industries here are more advanced than PIOs and Settlers


[21-Feb-22 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the other good thing to get into is BBH using PP1s


[21-Feb-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	basic fabs are the backbone of this game, and BBH takes more FE so its always favorable to make here


[21-Feb-22 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	BBH.NC1


[21-Feb-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	well that's not in my core competencies :p I mean, I really ran my construction business into the ground


[21-Feb-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	into the ground? thats impressive


[21-Feb-22 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	eh, it wasn't actually that bad


[21-Feb-22 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	I just liked the manufacturing industry better and thought I could get a better start and not be crawling my way back up to net profit


[21-Feb-22 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well the good news is H on MOR is very cheap, so COLs arnt required


[21-Feb-22 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as you can see, its cheaper than O, so extracting H instead of O here is losing even more money


[21-Feb-22 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pryde**:	well at least I can default to PE at a profit XD

**stilrz**:	noob question:  What is the cost of "demolishing" a building?


[22-Feb-22 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	From the above conversation demolishing my collector plant in favor of  feo extraction my be better.


[22-Feb-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GhostXD**:	Nothing. You might lose some fabs, based on the amount it says you can reclaim.


[22-Feb-22 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	When you open your list of buildings in the base it shows the material reclaimable upon demolishment.


[22-Feb-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	And do kill the collector, wrong planet for collecting O.


[22-Feb-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	great -- looked it up -- fully repaired building has not cost. Mine is lightly used so it will cost 1 BSE and 3 MSG


[22-Feb-22 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	one more day to collect 20H


[22-Feb-22 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	... and if not producing I would have no labor costs?


[22-Feb-22 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Your population will consume consumables regardless of production


[22-Feb-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	So you would have labour costs :)


[22-Feb-22 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	sigh, my last run to pick up rat and h20 was 2200 in fuel costs -- and I think I am on planet


[22-Feb-22 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**PawnStorm**:	yeah it's harsh at the start. With pro/basic you can buy/sell on the LM to avoid so many CX trips.


[22-Feb-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	This games needs project level accounting (and division and company levels too) .   Seems there is only one or two devs and they are working towards steam integration.  I do have a CS major son...


[22-Feb-22 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	noob hints: Don't upgrade your base. build/buy consumables before building fabs that use higher level workers. For instance I have already made PWO for settlers.


[22-Feb-22 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GhostXD**:	You need POW for pioneers


[22-Feb-22 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GhostXD**:	*PWO


[22-Feb-22 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	yes, POW -- power tools. sorry


[22-Feb-22 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	POW is power cells


[22-Feb-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	PWO = padded work overalls (PIO consumable), PT=Power Tools (SETs Consumable) POW=Power Cell, input material.

[24-Feb-22 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MadMonk21**:	that doesn't seem bad at all


[24-Feb-22 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Feb-22 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah, it's much better value than any of the Immigration programs


[24-Feb-22 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Good thing about that is we could put Adv Edu III in right away, without waiting a week like some other planets lol


[24-Feb-22 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Feb-22 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	how much?


[28-Feb-22 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	they are worth4k each to me


[28-Feb-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thats a bit steep....


[28-Feb-22 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	still working on working out the ECA inputs


[28-Feb-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well i make all the inputs, maybe we could work something out


[28-Feb-22 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	sometime soon I'll have a local ECA where that would be excellent


[28-Feb-22 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	but there's no rfabs to purchase on the exchanges so I can't make any progress


[28-Feb-22 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GhostXD**:	We should mabey fund one person to start making trans, exclusively for vallis


[28-Feb-22 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GhostXD**:	* instead of trans R-Fabs. Autocorrect is weird


[28-Feb-22 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I would give that person probably half a mil credits in all


[28-Feb-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I make rfabs exclusively for myself, does that count?


[28-Feb-22 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Also, not on Vallis, but I mostly use them here


[28-Feb-22 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GhostXD**:	You could sell them for a lot


[28-Feb-22 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	ive said this a couple times, but the choke on rfabs is epo


[28-Feb-22 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	must be people on dedicated pg bases still driving the price for that down as epo goes thru the roof


[28-Feb-22 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Armpit**:	I would like to run goods to and from the CX but the fees everyone on the local market are paying don't even cover the fuel costs for me. Please put some reasonable offers and I will take them. my ships are doing nothing


[23-Mar-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Armpit**:	2400 is the highest cost of fuel for a round trip


[23-Mar-22 05:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	hello! there's a whole lot of lowball offers on our LM. always remember the ads that stand are the ads that do not sell. I'd be happy to rent a full shipload from MOR


[23-Mar-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Armpit**:	ahh okay I was a bit bummed that they are all bad offers whenever I look and thought nobody uses this


[23-Mar-22 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	yeah do not feel obligated to accept lowballs. let the ads expire and realise nobody is going to sell RATs for 40 or gold ore for 165


[23-Mar-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I digress. what would you like for a MOR -> vallis trip?


[23-Mar-22 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	place both materials into the hold


[23-Mar-22 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	@armpit most people put up shipping contracts to help fill someone's hold who is already making a trip (small orders) usually around 3-5NCC per t/w sometimes people pay big money if they want it quickly or a high value cargo.


[23-Mar-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	This is a CASH based accounting/profit system. I know very confusing to plan


[23-Mar-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if people want to move whole ships worth of goods they usually pay more


[23-Mar-22 05:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Armpit**:	gotcha


[23-Mar-22 05:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	usually announce in chat when you are about to make a trip. some people will see that and go "Hey I got a small package you can take for me"


[23-Mar-22 05:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	So, soon to be Vallis Grand Negus, Get we get volunteers to run two trips to MorStation each week?


[23-Mar-22 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	@armpit, BTW Iron ore has crashed. Right now there is FEO available for 20 NCC a unit. The price support bot on the CX will pay 32. Alas only 84 will fit in a ship


[23-Mar-22 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its not the best thing to ship for profit when you can sell it locally


[23-Mar-22 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Mar-22 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

**PawnStorm**:	Is there any point funding popi currently. Butane could just run planetary festivities, everyone gets 20% happier. Sufficient folks hang around to keep us in business.

[24-Mar-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Armpit**:	but I am not renting a storage so wehre can I see it?


[24-Mar-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	check "own orders" to verify you bought it


[24-Mar-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CptWaffles**:	Check if you have a contract with the MOR CX in CONT, if you inventory is full it is sent there


[24-Mar-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CptWaffles**:	Then once you've got the space you can pick it up from there usually


[24-Mar-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	333 tons should fit in either space


[24-Mar-22 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Apr-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Also, Hello Vallis, We got out POPR last night. Without completely filling all the POPI we are still having growth in all areas! we only have 1 unemployed SCI and 64 ENGIs. Seeing how we had 93 last period and we gain 61, more buildings where added than growth.


[13-Apr-22 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Having a few open jobs also helps with growth. As unemployed pop hinders happiness. Saddly this also brings me to the 2nd major point. Stelios dropped Taxes hard at the end when he couldn't maintain it due to RL. I will be increasing taxes this week to help offset. Been spending a good bit more than we are bringing in.


[13-Apr-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	It will be curved so the high end pop pays more, as they cost more to keep. If you have any questions or comments feel free to DM me. (and sorry for the long posts)

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Hello Vallis. Filling the POPI from nothing is a huge pain. Ive updated the order list. DM me if you wish to sell goods to the Vallis Procurement Shop. Note the requested prices are usually lower than the open market, as this is not for profits but to better this planet for everyone on it. It also helps the Taxes to go farther. Also there will be a series of tax increases over the next few weeks to help with the depleting funds. I will strive to keep them as low as possible, but if people want high tier pop, then they have to pay more. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qWTf-pyPrTXM005QU6wfc85b-h-WTJt6ojV2e0Bi26E/edit?usp=sharing

[15-Apr-22 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I honestly wish I could find out how much taxes Im getting broken down by tier.....


[15-Apr-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	it seems that pioneers set at 16-20 pay for themselves. the other tiers vary widely with market supply


[15-Apr-22 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	Im sure its still weighted towards the low end, just because of scaling effects


[15-Apr-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well I set just set taxes on a scaling curve. higher for higher tier pop


[15-Apr-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I see that


[15-Apr-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	majority of the high tier buildings are most likely just farming the MM anyway


[15-Apr-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	the cost of taxes is like XX per 100 worker per day or something right?


[15-Apr-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	although I have ENGIs and they dont touch the MM


[15-Apr-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	you should be able to break it down by using popi and unemployment


[15-Apr-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	something like that


[15-Apr-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its just I would like something easier. But if I have to dig deep and get the numbers the hard way it is doable


[15-Apr-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I use eng, but not sci. still Id feel fine if you worked tiers like supply and demand. if there are unfilled jobs, I'd have no problem with paying a premium


[15-Apr-22 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	they do cost the most to maintain


[15-Apr-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	if thats the only way youre going to get the extra $$$ to boost them


[15-Apr-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	well we are currently running with a deficit right now. If I bought all the requested goods at the requested price we would be short 1.7 mil to pay it all off.


[15-Apr-22 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	up from 1.3 M when I got Gov


[15-Apr-22 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but 400k Isnt that much of a deficit growth when you think that taxes where kept as low as they where for as long as they where


[15-Apr-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	around 130k a week. So if I get tax income in the green about 50-100k to help pay off the debt that would be gold. then I can taper it off once we get a nice surpluss


[15-Apr-22 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean, I poured in a couple hundred K of stuff during the transition, so I think that deficit is probably larger if you were trying to fund everything through taxes


[15-Apr-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	All im accounting for right now is the VPS funds with needed goods.


[15-Apr-22 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	at avalon I get 110k in taxes and we have like 100 engineers. those higher tier taxes can go up


[15-Apr-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	last cycle I received $325,950 in taxes


[15-Apr-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	oh gotcha


[15-Apr-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I'm just hitting the MM right now with my eng's its still like 10k/day profit


[15-Apr-22 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	when I said 50-100k I ment 50-100k in the GREEN, not total


[15-Apr-22 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	and im on less than 100 engs, like 60 was free, 250 wouldnt be a lot


[15-Apr-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I mean if everyone who ran higher tier pop said to up taxes on engis to 250 (and sci above that) I would be more than happy to do so.


[15-Apr-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I need to figure out how to do those surveys that Stelios did. Maybe ill ping him again and see hows hes doing


[15-Apr-22 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I mean ask around, but If you needed the money, Id rather pay it there than on pio/set


[15-Apr-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	althought, like someone else said, ~20 would be fine down there too


[15-Apr-22 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Right, thats why the tier taxees are great


[15-Apr-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	sweet jesus, I just looked at Montems taxes, Engies are at 1k and SCI are at 2k


[15-Apr-22 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	im still SUPER cheap


[15-Apr-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	i dunno give it a couple days, check in with people, if you doubled it, tomorrow and again in a week, its not gunna hurt people at those teirs


[15-Apr-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	or more, im just saying for me, fwiw


[15-Apr-22 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	brb im going to bump those numbers up again..... not THAT much but still some


[15-Apr-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I probably should have looked at those numbers first. downside of just waking up


[15-Apr-22 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-22 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-22 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Dwarden**:	hi Nocknuck ... wanna trade those ? i'm newbie with U rating still trying to orient in the maze of UI


[18-Apr-22 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	Your gonna need a Pro account or you can buy from the CX


[18-Apr-22 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dwarden**:	wait, i can't trade at all ?


[18-Apr-22 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	cx is open to all


[18-Apr-22 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	You cant trade on the planet local market however if you take your ship to the CX it is an open market for the entire solar system


[18-Apr-22 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dwarden**:	oh so no direct / local trade available w/o pro account, only public


[18-Apr-22 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	yep


[18-Apr-22 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dwarden**:	oh so except CX i'm sort of screwed ... cause i can't take any trade/tasks as U and nor LM as trial


[18-Apr-22 04:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	Yes unfortuantly


[18-Apr-22 04:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	I dont like this system either.


[18-Apr-22 04:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	it is unfortunately needed to keep random people from coming in, grabbing everything and then disappearing with your precious goods; however, once you paid once, you can still accept LM offers even after your PRO expires

**Nocknuck**:	Still you can't make shipping contracts and you can only have 2 ships flying at a time.


[18-Apr-22 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nocknuck**:	So any larger expansion gets impossible without PRO


[18-Apr-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	over a year in and i finally understand why needing more than 2 ships flying is a thing


[18-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-22 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	regardless, we can do our part by being welcoming and helping folks get over that initial hump


[19-Apr-22 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	It would be nice if we could share screens.


[19-Apr-22 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-22 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Well that did reach out to folks to do some recording (I did a handful of videos for them) and one of the ones I did was "Okay, you just made your company... here's a very basic screen you can use"


[19-Apr-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	So maybe they'll have enough material to get people going


[19-Apr-22 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	We as a planet should be able to put up an add BEFORE they found their first stating just that. 1) 1hr of user tech support  chat/shaired screen


[19-Apr-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	yeah that wouldn't be a bad thing, hopefully people join here or the discord and ask.  I am sure plenty of people would be happy


[19-Apr-22 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Apr-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Techen**:	Why is it smoggy :P


[20-Apr-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lokiorin**:	Well for starters you've got @Butanethedwarfking and dozens of other smelting focused companies just burning 24/7.  Plus others (including myself) are shoveling plants into furnaces as fast as possible to make C.  End result, the air quality takes a minor... dip.  Don't worry though, CEO offices are built with the finest air scrubbers money can buy, just best not to think too much about your PIOs


[20-Apr-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Apr-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah smelters is probably the #1 building on this planet. But for the last few Cycles we have ran Metallurgy in our CoGC (Chamber of Global Commerce) to give all metallurgy a 25% production boost! The people votes for it and we have kept it for many weeks with out any real complaints


[20-Apr-22 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**shadowsneak**:	hello!


[21-Apr-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	Hoi chummer


[21-Apr-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	theres been a lot of new people, its not always so quiet


[21-Apr-22 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	Yeah I'm new, too. I saw an ad for this game on some random youtube video ages ago, but forgot to join, and then saw it launched on Steam so I thought I'd give it a go.


[21-Apr-22 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	well, if you love numbers and spreadsheets, real live market dynamics, youll have fun here


[21-Apr-22 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	be patient with the first few weeks, its a slow burn though


[21-Apr-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	I played industrial in Eve Online for a while. We'll see how it goes and if I have time enough to commit to it, but looks fun so far.


[21-Apr-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	this really wont take much time at all in the start


[21-Apr-22 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i played 5 months on basic less than an hour a day


[21-Apr-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	Nice


[21-Apr-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but pro....and trading with people, working in a corp, its all so much better


[21-Apr-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	Right now I'm working out how to organize my screen. Wondering if I even need the big universe map there at this point. Thinking no.


[21-Apr-22 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i dont use the base screen they give you at all


[21-Apr-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	part of the joy of this game is making your own layouts


[21-Apr-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	Oh, I didn't realize it was possible to change screens until you mentioned it.


[21-Apr-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	That opens up options.


[21-Apr-22 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its a blank canvas :D


[21-Apr-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**mdk31**:	So is the metallurgical market gonna be pretty badly saturated soon?


[21-Apr-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	not here. There is a use of FE

[23-Apr-22 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	lots of iron here. Extractors will pull out FEO and then you need SME -- smelter to make your own.


[23-Apr-22 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hanzyfranzy**:	yeah good news is i am making MCG and BSE, i can use those to build those buildings


[23-Apr-22 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	I wil lhave a tiny amount ot spare in a day or so. Others have more


[23-Apr-22 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-22 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I always need more PE XD


[23-Apr-22 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hanzyfranzy**:	well the spread on FE is high so my orders aren't being filled


[23-Apr-22 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-22 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	NORMALLY it sits around the low 300s


[23-Apr-22 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but the prices have been all out of wack lately


[23-Apr-22 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**stilrz**:	me too


[23-Apr-22 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	But seriously its because I bought a supporter package


[23-Apr-22 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I got a lot of time spent in this game, its worth a few bucks to me


[23-Apr-22 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	The real secret is that we both have beards. It helps filter the Smaug from the smelters


[23-Apr-22 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	indeed, I also have a massive beard IRL too. XD (you can see it on the steam page as I did some recording for the Devs)


[23-Apr-22 05:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Both mostly


[23-Apr-22 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	or in my case The corps is what collects the taxes, and I get a share of them. But since im the only one, I get them all

**hanzyfranzy**:	trying to get extra cash but apparently ratings are a thing


[23-Apr-22 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hanzyfranzy**:	how does one increase their rating


[23-Apr-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	You have to buy pro-license atleast once to get a rating


[23-Apr-22 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hanzyfranzy**:	Ah so they local markets are basically just for pro license, got it


[23-Apr-22 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hanzyfranzy**:	i assume this is to stop griefers


[23-Apr-22 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Assanova**:	ive heard that reason be said before, but i feel like the same effect can be done if people started requiring ratings beyond "P"


[23-Apr-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**hanzyfranzy**:	sounds like it is time to go pro


[23-Apr-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	if you just get 1 month and let it expire (there is no auto renews) you will downgrade into a BASIC, you can still acess the LM, but you cant post.


[23-Apr-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Good morning Vallis. Well good news and bad news time. Good news is we have TONS of new people, bad news is that means the POPI requirements EXPLODED! The CoGC over doubled.


[25-Apr-22 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Hey, at least we’re not promitor!


[25-Apr-22 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	facts


[25-Apr-22 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	For all the new people, I run a procurement shop to buy all the goods for the POPI (population Infrastructure). A way to buy back your taxes. You can sell goods that are needed on there to me. The prices set there are recommended prices to help keep taxes low. However we are running at a large deficit. Hopefully thats due to the population boom before a full week of taxes. However there will most likely be a tax increase again. Planned tax hike will be after the current cycle resets. For those currious of our planets current needs feel free to check the spread sheet for the VPS here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qWTf-pyPrTXM005QU6wfc85b-h-WTJt6ojV2e0Bi26E/edit?usp=sharing

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Soon I will be dropping 3 more STOs tho


[25-Apr-22 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	Well, I figured it might be hard to sell since I know everyone else is cooking FEO, but it is more than I need right now and thought I could try and sell it.


[25-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	I did not see extracting FEO as profitable on Vallis. I do smelt it though


[25-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	I'll take 200


[25-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its pretty profitable, as its mostly profits as there is no imputs other than food costs


[25-Apr-22 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	let me make a sell order


[25-Apr-22 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	make it only 100 plz


[25-Apr-22 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	sure I am making the order right now


[25-Apr-22 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	nvm, I forgot to upgrade my account to pro. I can not post to the Vallis CXL :(


[25-Apr-22 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	interesting I've had pro, but I had let it expire. Saving my money for Dune Spice Wars.


[25-Apr-22 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Apr-22 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	Carbon is the expensive ingrediant. I have a seperate base doing some of that


[25-Apr-22 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	sounds like you need to ship carbon from hortus. it's sold at MM prices on boucher


[25-Apr-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	shipping is very expensive in this game and there is no simple way IN GAME to compute that.


[25-Apr-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	which is why longer trips on less popular routes demands the use of your own ships


[25-Apr-22 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	operating an STL ship on the exchange system will give your FTL ships leeway to undertake these less popular routes


[25-Apr-22 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Yeah I have seen some opportunity to get cheaper resources from elsewhere but, I do have one small problem in that I can't seem to get there


[25-Apr-22 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	for very long destinations you need to pack fuel in your storage and fly to halfway points


[25-Apr-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	plan for round trips too... Once ship has landed use fly button on ship


[25-Apr-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	ONLY when landed can you plan trips


[25-Apr-22 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	single destiination with fuel bars rated in full capacity of tanks


[25-Apr-22 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	I'm currently just making a spreadsheet of known costs of goods to plan my next move here


[25-Apr-22 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Idk if I'm ready to tackle shipping and FX quite yet haha


[25-Apr-22 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	look for the amount of fuel used and the amount of time secondarily


[25-Apr-22 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	sure you are. doing 3000 ncc shipping runs can pay expences and perhaps get you to the Morstation for free


[25-Apr-22 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	or get you stranded Muhahahaha


[25-Apr-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	@Jay2smooth, being a manufacture is not terrible on Vallis as you can get your metals pretty easy and cheap since there there is no shipping on this metallurgy world

**CapitanIncognito**:	Manufacturing is very versatile


[25-Apr-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the BMP has a ton of recipes


[25-Apr-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I forget what it starts you with though


[25-Apr-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I guess starting with that many recipes can be overwhelming because you don't really know which ones have a good market


[25-Apr-22 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	the STL -> PT, STL + SFK -> PT, STL + TRN -> PT recipes seem decent. PE is probably better right now


[25-Apr-22 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-22 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Manufacturing is painful as a new player.  It's going to be a month before I raise enough capital to build new buildings


[26-Apr-22 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	starting out is slow, but that seems extra slow. what are your current plans?


[26-Apr-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	It's going to sound lazy but, I'm bringing PE to market to sell once I have enough to make the shipping costs worth it

**Xrash**:	are you collecting your own H on Vallis :P ?


[26-Apr-22 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Yes I am


[26-Apr-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	Vallis is a pretty poor source of both H and O, you might wanna consider buying instead and investing into another building instead


[26-Apr-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Def not building another collector


[26-Apr-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	More so hoping for a WPL or POL


[26-Apr-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	But, I'll need more Habs or Settler hab which is a considerable cost


[26-Apr-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	yes, those first couple additional buildings are kinda steep


[26-Apr-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I think I took ~ 10 days to get mine


[26-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	What did you start out at @cranearmy?


[26-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	constructor


[26-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I think thats what its called


[26-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Ah you're the devil with the expensive parts I need ;)


[26-Apr-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xrash**:	the first few days are super enjoyable in that regard - looking at where to expand, what to produce, I'll let you enjoy that on your own unless you're actively looking for help.


[26-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	ya, sorry. I've diversified since then, Ive only got one pp1 and it mostly feeds my pp3


[26-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Yeah I'm just poking for timelines.  I went absolutely nuts yesterday and made a spreadsheet


[26-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I'd also consider looking for the community resources


[26-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	there are some really well done tools in there


[26-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	What is a community resource?


[26-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Ohhh


[26-Apr-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Apr-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	?? I make carbon off planet on celebdill due my bonusses for extractor services.  HCP/GRN/MAI can somtimes be bought here on Vallis LM otherwise on CX MorStation

**Jay2smooth**:	Boys I just found out I can demolish my collector.  This changes things drastically.  I might be able to make some moves after I recalculate everything after work


[26-Apr-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zeishud**:	The one from the Community Resources in the handbook?


[26-Apr-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	yup alas a 20% cost


[26-Apr-22 08:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	yes


[26-Apr-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	25% bonus in production for metallurgy here on vallis plus you will gain your own experts


[26-Apr-22 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	Be sure to run with 100% consumables -- that is the hard part starting out -- keeping ( and paying for) supplies

[26-Apr-22 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	need FLX? new batches on the LM!


[26-Apr-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	I'll be ready to deliver my powerpoint by 10pm tonight lol


[26-Apr-22 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Also is it a bad idea to build a FRM on Vallis?  Found out that H isn't a great thing to be collecting here


[26-Apr-22 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	you remind me of my first time settling vallis


[26-Apr-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	H collectors, Farms, and C burners to make PE was very painful


[26-Apr-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	That being said farms are half decent if you are planning to supply your own C to smelt with


[26-Apr-22 10:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	outside of that, hard pass


[26-Apr-22 10:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Yeah mainly considering either reducing cost in my own C production or making RCO to turn into COT.  Which after doing the math is a losing proposition


[26-Apr-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Vallis is basically a smelters paradise with the 25% bonus to metallurgy


[26-Apr-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	most other starter industries are at a disadvantage here


[26-Apr-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	I have noticed that my Manufacturing plant is out of place lol


[26-Apr-22 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Frelix_Arcadia**:	I started with manufacturing also...but I'm gonna make it work dammit!


[26-Apr-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there are some good recipes that use STL and FS outputs


[26-Apr-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Yeah unless there's a starter planet that provides me with benefits for manufacturing I don't think I'm going to coliq again


[26-Apr-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	Katoa


[26-Apr-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i think....


[26-Apr-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Do smelters need any of my outputs in manufacturing?


[26-Apr-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as consumables yes


[26-Apr-22 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	as inputs, no


[26-Apr-22 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Hmm this is an interesting argument for the coliq option haha


[26-Apr-22 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Who requires SUN?


[26-Apr-22 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
***Nontrox** joined.*


[26-Apr-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	SUN is a maintenance upkeep material for Safety Stations, it is used in very small quanitites


[26-Apr-22 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the entire planet uses about 30/d


[26-Apr-22 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	several of the BMP recipes are similar in that way, OFF and STR as well


[26-Apr-22 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Crap, so I might need to consider doing something different here


[26-Apr-22 10:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	its possible to run BMPs here, but its not as easy as smelting :D


[26-Apr-22 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	I have a day before I can COLIQ so I might as well try something crazy in the meantime


[26-Apr-22 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Hey where'd you get that consumption data on SUN?


[26-Apr-22 10:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	planet infrastructure, safety station details


[26-Apr-22 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but its somewhat of a nuance ;)


[26-Apr-22 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Jay2smooth**:	Okay I'm following.  What happens if that number remains 0 when consumption occurs?

[27-Apr-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	all tiers dropped except ENG


[27-Apr-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	looks like we need safety boost, and then comfort/culture/edu


[27-Apr-22 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Apr-22 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	i feel like that road leads to a purge lol


[27-Apr-22 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but for real, to raise safety drone stations will be a thing


[27-Apr-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	i can cook up an ADS for it


[27-Apr-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i would talk to Butane 1 on 1 about that, hes sourcing parts as far as i know


[27-Apr-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	will do


[27-Apr-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	Better approach: There was a scenario in SimCity of Old Detroit. Everyone was leaving. So the simple solution was to bulldoze the roads till you could get enough jobs and parks developed. Did not work in real life though


[27-Apr-22 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	@Madmonk I cancelled the order since I filled it from the CX. I ended up tearing down my EDM and I plan to get out of drones production as well


[27-Apr-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	So probably the last POW I'll be buying for some time


[27-Apr-22 03:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Although..  with the new pops, maybe drones will be for more than just the MM?


[27-Apr-22 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	possible we'll see more drone stations being built


[27-Apr-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Of course, I'm sure other people do drones


[27-Apr-22 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	part of me wants to stop trying to produce everything, just for my own sanity


[27-Apr-22 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	The problem is we keep running out of one thing or another


[27-Apr-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and so now I'm tempted to start up a base for CUO -> CU


[27-Apr-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	But of course, once I do that, I kind of have to use it too


[27-Apr-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I mean I need a bit for making HMS


[27-Apr-22 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	but a full base will make a whole lot more than that

**CapitanIncognito**:	@JimmySmithers Mostly planning, but some people also spent early times trading at the CX (buy low/sell high type thing) or trading between CXs. The one at Hortus usually has cheaper DW/RATs but paid more for construction stuff. You'd have to double check because I haven't looked at those prices in awhile


[27-Apr-22 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Greeting Vallis. Im sorry, but due to the state of the POPI demand and the boon of people we received I have no choice but to spike the taxes once again. We are getting just too little. We have been spoiled with rock bottom taxes for far too long. Specialy with the costs of all the POPI goods increasing. Of course the higher tier population will feel the hit, but I tried to keep all tiers a rough % increase


[01-May-22 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	If the Coffers of the Vallis Gov start growing more than anticipated I will drop them at that time. I too am burdened with paying taxes afterall.


[01-May-22 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Im going to run 1 week of Education to push some of the mass of POIs and SETs we have, and hopefully that will alleviate some of the POPI requirements. As the last POPI we had almost 40% of our PIOs unemployed.

[01-May-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah, and seeing how I currently have only 1.37M...


[01-May-22 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	time for a tax raise?


[01-May-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	scratch that def numbers, just over 1.6 Mil in the red. and thats not even fully filling the UNI and PBH


[01-May-22 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	this population boom is killing me


[01-May-22 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	what's the cause? the massive influx of players? XD


[01-May-22 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	mostly


[01-May-22 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	causes the CoGC to over double in requirements because its based on # of bases.


[01-May-22 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but that also means more tax revenue. its just the main factor is we recently transitioned from an absentee Gov (no hate on him, RL just got in the way) and caused a bunch of neglect to the POPI, about 2 weeks before they left they dropped all taxes to pretty much nothing as a sorry.


[01-May-22 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	so what now? all the new guys will get taxed to death as they figure out how to properly play?


[01-May-22 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah, the CoGC is killer because the new guys pay next to nothing but the cost to run it is per base


[01-May-22 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thats why the lower tiers pay lower taxes, SCI require much higher taxes as they are the hardest to keep


[01-May-22 10:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	@Voyer Donations are always appreciated. I also look first to the people of Vallis to sell goods to the "Vallis Procurement Shop" (VPS). So you basicly sell your goods to the Gov and get tax money back.

[01-May-22 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Like I said, but it may help shape your growth


[01-May-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	in that regard you are saying that the deficit of whatever goods Vallis needs would be an avenue of expansion?


[01-May-22 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	no, its funds to cover cost of goods


[01-May-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	to buy every good on the list right now would cost 4.3 mil, but the coffers only have 1.3 mil, so the def is almost 3 mil


[01-May-22 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-May-22 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	that population chart seems like these digitized people forgot all about Thomas Malthus


[01-May-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	thus the tax increase to help close that gap


[01-May-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	so would me helping just involve like a cash donation?


[01-May-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	or mats that are sold to you for the upkeep


[01-May-22 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	cash donation are always appreciated, or donation is goods is also good.


[01-May-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah, I buy them all since im the Governing entity


[01-May-22 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	then i put them in the POPI


[01-May-22 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	i mean the expenditure charting would infer to us, newbies, that there is significant demand with basic manufactured goods, and as such, market opportunities to be had on NC1


[01-May-22 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	however against that, Moria isn't the best place for certain goods, like most of the raw recources for various smelting processes that we specialize in on this planet


[01-May-22 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	so to diversify, or not, is the question


[01-May-22 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	exactly, but I do try to get as much as I can from people who have A base here


[01-May-22 11:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	i see, like the requested qty of DW is like 5.4k lol but i can make MCG and PE so


[01-May-22 11:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is several things that take DW, but its terrible to make here. So I need to go off world. Or buy it semeone who HAS multiple bases and 1 is for DW


[01-May-22 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	Right it all depends on the planet resources in regards to determining what players will generally specialize on it


[01-May-22 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Vallis is pretty much the FE capital of the Verse. and the Moria system makes soo many bfabs its silly


[01-May-22 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	haha yea noticed montem is LST and FEO so this is the prefab central, probably something i was going to get into eventually


[01-May-22 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but im very tired. havent been sleeping much lately. so im going to bounce. Sorry again for the tax hike but its kind of needed


[01-May-22 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	it is what it is, have a good night


[01-May-22 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	our FE/O is way better than Montem, usually end up shipping a lot of FE over there on ships that bring LST over here


[01-May-22 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	full both ways is always nice

[01-May-22 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	i mean i know i cant make a base on montem so.. lol


[01-May-22 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	BBH is better here since its 2 FE, BSE is better on Montem since its 2 LST


[01-May-22 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	well if you accidentally chose the metallurgy package like i did, and landed on here as well, you're stuck with mining iron and putting in smelt jobs until next week


[01-May-22 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	i picked manufacturing :P and yea i saw the recipe ratio


[01-May-22 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	@Roh, you can always reset with the COLIQ command


[01-May-22 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but its also nice to push through and learn as much as you can from 1 go


[01-May-22 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Voyer**:	yea thats usually my strat


[01-May-22 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Roh**:	mmm that might be a good idea - especially considering the two week timers going on my production plants


[02-May-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sentinel_Mara**:	just there i complete 6 of them for 60k


[02-May-22 12:22 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sentinel_Mara**:	yeah, but but HRT station have it for 229 last time i check


[02-May-22 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sentinel_Mara**:	if i buy it in bulk, i can sell Carbon for 400 here


[02-May-22 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sentinel_Mara**:	but i have only 1000 ICA... 20k CIS and 30 NCC


[02-May-22 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sentinel_Mara**:	*30k NCC... so cant buy there


[02-May-22 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	not outragous so if it sold it sold and i make some profit, but when the planets align i can transfer them over

[02-May-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	yeah C prices right now make it challenging for new smelters


[02-May-22 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	not a bad time to go into C, although it probably won't stay long at those prices


[02-May-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-May-22 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Carbon-Space**:	One week ago, i started my very first try of this game as metallugist. Everything is developing fine and i got my first profits. Can i assist the comunity on Vallis in any case? Don't know yet what for is the governor. I can vote, but don't know what it really means.


[04-May-22 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	There are population upkeep resource requirements, the governor typically sources them from residents to help reinvest the tax money. Being in metallurgy there are limited goods that are consumed for upkeep purposes. For now, focusing on selling and growing your base is very important!

However our open jobs for ENGIs and SCIs grew more than the units we received. We just need to increase education a bit more. Perhaps Ill run a 2nd term of it.

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	@Jwce, FEO isnt really profitable to ship to other CXs, as the cost for an entire ship is pretty low since its soo heavy. The reason why FEO is soo low to MM here is because its soo readily available. But at the same time there is many people who go through more than a single ships worth in a day

[12-May-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	and MHP 2800 would be nice, However all prices for the VPH is negotiable, as I just try to get the POPI goods as low as possible.

**CapitanIncognito**:	Ah yeah, I don't think I can do AAR nearly that cheap


[12-May-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I could do some math on the MHP, but my EDM isn't here anymore


[12-May-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I'd have to build a new one


[12-May-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Well the last AAR sold on the CX was at 10k.


[12-May-22 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but AU prices have been rising, now as much as CU prices. I really need to scale up 929b

[12-May-22 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-May-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I struggle to make enough KV


[12-May-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	Only have 4 WPLs and they do COT and NL too


[12-May-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and they only run  at 127% because Prism's CoGC is no help


[12-May-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	I considered moving them to some sort of manufacturing world, but the only one I know of is out by Circe and I'd probably want to do higher end stuff out there


[12-May-22 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	although... my TCL does come from Circe


[12-May-22 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	At the end of the day the real limiting factors are permits and sanity


[12-May-22 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	There's parts of me that want to burn it all down and just do electronics


[12-May-22 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and then I remind myself that half my bases exist to secure consumables or inputs for my electronics


[12-May-22 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-May-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-May-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	place a buy ad


[14-May-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you said you wanted to sell me SOL at 1900/u, but SOL should only be around 800-900/u and SP should be around 1900/u


[14-May-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	think you got a bit of a mix up


[14-May-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	I have never since I placed an ECA on vallis 3 months ago have sold SOL anywhere near 800


[14-May-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-May-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	SOL.NC1


[14-May-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	SP.NC1


[14-May-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	they sure do. there's a buy ad for SP right now at 2200


[14-May-22 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	anyway. if we can't agree on a price it's no problem. take the glass back


[14-May-22 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	it takes 2 SOL to make 1 SP, so if I bought SOL @ 1900/u I would need to sell SP at 3800 to brake even....


[14-May-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	which is why I rarely sell SP cause there's plenty of demand for SOL


[14-May-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	but every once in a while when I have leftovers I put them up


[14-May-22 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Broot**:	PP1s can do well on vallis, lots of iron is produced here and montem is full of limestone


[15-May-22 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	But past that, unless you're also smelting and hauling in ALO then it can get tricky with the higher tiers


[15-May-22 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	AL is pretty light compared to iron


[15-May-22 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	and its cheap AF because people dump it as a biproduct from BE production

**CraneArmy**:	how much soi do you need?


[18-May-22 08:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I dont think id be able to do it "soon", but I can probably make an extra trip to circe to build another CHP/EXT that I was gunna built anyway


[18-May-22 08:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	like ~160 in 7-10 days, I dunno how profitable it is, but if its an emergency I could definitely ramp that up for a few days


[18-May-22 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	To fill the POPI I need 600, but Vallis' rate of consumption is about 20/d

[19-May-22 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I dont think I can keep up 20/d because the shipping of all that stuff is just too heavy


[19-May-22 12:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	203 days and no pro, thats kind of impressive.


[19-May-22 01:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but it can show all the new people you can play for quite some time and not get pro

[19-May-22 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	Ill put up a week's worth at the input price, I'm just asking because it doesnt look like the inputs move quick on the exchange, and if I put in to buy it at the current ask its like 450


[19-May-22 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	if you want it lower I cant promise when you have it


[19-May-22 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I will buy for what I can get it at. But I always try to get as low as possible. this helps the tax money go farther.


[19-May-22 12:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	yep, I just dont know how its used, like if it becomes an emergency

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah.


[19-May-22 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but I also mine and process CU/O myself


[19-May-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	appreciate it!


[19-May-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	one reason for the spike is because I havent been able to supply the CX for a while.


[19-May-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	people keep cleaning me out before I could get some there


[19-May-22 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	ah


[19-May-22 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I recently dropped 8 more EXTs and my 3k-t ship should also help moving that extra ore out


[19-May-22 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I just got to wait on population out there


[19-May-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	ahh


[19-May-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	ya, thats kinda the problem on the perimeter isnt it


[19-May-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	I thought I remember looking for a planet with cuo and O and couldnt find one, then I ditched the idea


[19-May-22 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	but if you can afford a bunch of big haulers its probably less important to worry about


[19-May-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	now I can have ships full of O/SIO/PE heading to the planet and full ships leaving as well


[19-May-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-22 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-22 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	and it never sits on the cx for long


[19-May-22 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	its harder to get rid of au


[19-May-22 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	so any problems with it are not "too much supply"


[19-May-22 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-May-22 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CapitanIncognito**:	Yeah... use EDC


[19-May-22 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	unless you're already doing that


[19-May-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	and just trying to increase the amount of stuff


[19-May-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CapitanIncognito**:	You could probably even get 2 IDC for less than 10 AARs


[19-May-22 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**XoverN**:	anybody know the rate for the gas collector?


[24-May-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordraz**:	depends on the gas and experts


[24-May-22 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordraz**:	3 units of O ~9 hours


[24-May-22 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	and 2 units of hydrogen i am guessing?


[24-May-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	not really worth it then


[24-May-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordraz**:	1 unit of H ~7 hours


[24-May-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	ah


[24-May-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	It’s way better to buy the gasses elsewhere


[24-May-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordraz**:	depends, I've been a gasser for a few months now, still going


[24-May-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	buying it is for me then. would need 2 collectors to run a poly-etylene 24/7.


[24-May-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I did that for the first 2 months I played, self producing it was sooooo slow


[24-May-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	buying would be nearly as good as collecting, not really worth the 25k in materials for the building


[24-May-22 08:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordraz**:	yeh thats the choice, I've considerd thing slike making my own water etc but ultimately specialisation is probably better


[24-May-22 08:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	vertical bases come at the cost of efficiency and profit, horizontal bases come at the cost of shipping and market prices for inputs


[24-May-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	yah


[24-May-22 08:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordraz**:	and its not the end of the world if you market crashes out, happenned to me once, I just hoarded what I could and waited it out


[24-May-22 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mordraz**:	no food, no water, was able to restart on what little stock I had


[24-May-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	used to profit from basic overalls. buy RCO and make carbon and PE. Then someone dumped 28k stock, lowering the price from 90 to 59. I am now switching to Drinking water...


[24-May-22 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	At the other end when you start buying 10,000 ncc of certain items it is better to invest 25k in new buildings or even new planet


[24-May-22 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	When the need becomes that large, that is true


[24-May-22 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	I am about ready to build a POL unit


[24-May-22 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	POLs are great! They’re hungry to feed though


[24-May-22 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	thx, I learned that lesson trying to feed a FS


[24-May-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	Alright, I knew that h20 extraction in Vallis would be bad


[24-May-22 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Naut**:	Yeah. I spend a bunch of time going over the handbook etc., looked at some of the provided resources and devided to stick to pure FEO extraction for now.

**Naut**:	I found another good planet for feo near hortus as well with almost double the feo through the fio.fnar.net tool, but I added the base cost together...100k for just the base alone...Let's see how long I have to dig for feo on valis until I can open up a second location down there


[26-May-22 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stackem**:	Consider logistics when you do that. You can only move 183 FEO per ship, so If you want to do major manufacturing you need to account for that. As well, more jumps is more fuel and more ship repairs


[26-May-22 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stackem**:	You can consider that if it's one jump, or not much consumption. But much more of either condition is a recipe for a bad time


[26-May-22 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stackem**:	So there are planets with better concentrations of FEO, but they are usually inconveniently far away or underdeveloped by comparison. Convenience dictates Vallis is the, if not best, least bad FEO


[26-May-22 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	don't be afraid of  going vertical on your production. 1) Build EXt 2) make money 3) build smelter AND buy flx, C,O to 5 days of production


[26-May-22 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Like I said, Vallis is the best t-1 planet for FEO, its a decent deposit and its right next to the CX, take it from me, Metals and ores are a pain to move


[26-May-22 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its one of the reasons why Moria is like the bfab capital of the 'verse

**XoverN**:	kinda wandering if i should build an extractor


[26-May-22 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	operating one would cost me 308/day, but buying the FEO at ask amount(moria) would cost me 476/day


[26-May-22 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	depends if the kind folks of vallis has extra FEO to sell, I guess...


[26-May-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	but considering that there are buy orders in the local market 50% above the CX price, I better build one, huh...


[26-May-22 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	the bigger deal with ores is being able to mine them where you use them


[26-May-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	shipping what one extractor will pull out on vallis in a day is expensive and complicated


[26-May-22 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	aye. 5.9tons per unit, I aint touching that. so I thought to buy locally, but I was too optimistic


[26-May-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	shipping Limestone is making me cry as it is


[26-May-22 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	if you can stock it far in advance on lm you might be able to get away with it


[26-May-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	but it just gets really easy to streamline everything with heavy goods like feo


[26-May-22 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraneArmy**:	if you can mine it locally


[26-May-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	aye. tbh, i am crying over building habitations. I could build 2 smelters NOW, or i can build an extractor then a habitat and then a smelter


[26-May-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	for me buying FEO is better because then I can focus my space and experts on refining said FEO


[26-May-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but I ran EXTs for a LONG time


[26-May-22 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	not everyone has a kingdom m8. Check your privi***!


[26-May-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but with 20 SMEs I cant have enough EXTs to feed them all


[26-May-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	XD


[26-May-22 04:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	it took me a long time to get to this point tho


[26-May-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I started out as a small operation here on Vallis


[26-May-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	still a newb to game, but aint that an overkill? wouldn't that use a little over 220 FEO per day..?


[26-May-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	how do you even get that ore long term?


[26-May-22 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	yeah, I go though a lot, but I also smelt ALO, CUO, TIO...


[26-May-22 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I know people who have bases where its basicly just EXTs


[26-May-22 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	aah, so vallis is the main smelting point for you? doesnt shipping cost too much then?


[26-May-22 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	but I also have a lot of higher tier production that takes all those metals and processes it farther


[26-May-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I have 6 Metalist Studios and 4 High-power Blast Furnaces


[26-May-22 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	I ship very little metals off world compared to what I make


[26-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	welp, i still dont have a single settler, i aint even looking at that stuff.


[26-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	thanks for the info, m8. Its 1 am for me, good night/day to you


[26-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	there is a ton of settlers available from the pool


[26-May-22 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	we have almost 16k settlers who need jobs


[26-May-22 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Zeishud**:	Hey. Anyone willing to buy some Iron Ore and willing to help me out? So im on BASIC License, im running out of money to pay for the production fees and I just have ~70 Iron Ore that i can sell. Problem is, there is no BUY order for Iron Ore on the LM. I dont want to upgrade to PRO just to post one ad and I dont want to fly a half full ship to MOR to sell Iron. If possible, could anyone put up a BUY order for idk maybe 50 Iron Ore on the LM? I would be willing to sell for cheap, as long as my Production doesnt have to stop.

**JarJarBings**:	We are slowly getting there maybe Butane can help here 😀 As the WAR has no upkeep costs but creates rev. maybe the GOV. can finish it off 😀 I am not sure if the current fees are paying for a previous update 😀

**Shuchou**:	What is with all the BS buy orders for iron ore on Moria Vallis


[01-Jun-22 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**XoverN**:	ehhh. a unit of iron ore is 5.9 tons, making it impractical to carry it to station. Its basically taking up space if your smelter/extractor lines are not adjusted. might as well give throw it away for chump-change at that point. Thankfully, there are people who still buy it at a reasonable price.


[01-Jun-22 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shuchou**:	12NCC per unit isn't reasonable xD


[01-Jun-22 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Green73**:	It may be a mistake in the price or contract for someone in the same corporation.

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	We also had taxes SUPER low for a VERY long time, so a lot of the long term people got spoiled.


[09-Jun-22 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Last week we had growth on all the higher tiers (not counting PIOs since we have SOOOO many unemployed)


[09-Jun-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Montem lost a lot of ENGIs and SCI last period and their taxes are significantly higher than what we are currently running


[09-Jun-22 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Jun-22 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Blue_Eagle**:	ooo


[10-Jun-22 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Blue_Eagle**:	need to learn the markets


[10-Jun-22 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	the simplest advice is to try to trade on LM ( Yes, getting pro for a month is required)  that way you reduce transportation costs. Also taking on shipments now works -- instant cash flow from idle resources.


[10-Jun-22 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	@Olou even with a 3k hauler (I have one) You can only transport 381/u of FEO.  Say you can sell it @ 450/u thats only 171.5k for an entire ship.

**Olou**:	I gues its not a ton of profit but I calculate a cost of 7990 round trip, if you make 50/u profit, assuming you buy it here at 350 and sell for 400 it comes out to 19,050. Im not sure on the damage  cost to the ship in the calculations. At 450 you clear double at 38k


[15-Jun-22 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	2 day round trip...

[18-Jun-22 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koibu**:	The costs (parts and consumables) at market rates right now are about 10k to make. I'm buying them for 20k each, so that's >10k/day in profits

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	Hey Vallis, While I thank everyone for their support and faith in me, I feel like my time here is coming to an end. I have been getting super busy with RL stuff as I am starting my own business. I will not be going for re-election this term. I will however be handing over the Gov funds to whoever wins along with any POPI goods I have aquired. As much fun as I have had playing this game its starting to become more of a chore to keep up with everything and my IRL tasks. I will be staying on for a while yet, just not as active.  Thanks again for everything. Butane The Dwarf King

**Zeishud**:	What in the holy mother of Jesus is going on with FE in MOR


[08-Jul-22 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zeishud**:	I dont want to sell at 275/u, but my upkeep is running out :(


[08-Jul-22 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**armorlord**:	sounds like you need to divest away from FE, likely the most common product this planet produces


[08-Jul-22 08:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zeishud**:	The thing is, I don't have the financial capabilities to rearrange my production lines


[08-Jul-22 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	time to start smelting ALO!


[08-Jul-22 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illiterati1**:	maybe even CUO


[08-Jul-22 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zeishud**:	I have Extractors supplying my Smelteries with FEO. Let's say I were to switch to smelting ALO or CUO, will the Workers from the Extractors cost me upkeep when they are just sitting there on Idle?


[08-Jul-22 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	yes. you would need to tear down the extractors to not spend consumables on them


[08-Jul-22 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zeishud**:	Sounds like a risky undertaking....


[08-Jul-22 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	FE goes through waves of prices every few months


[08-Jul-22 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	but since the steam wave it has been higher than usual


[08-Jul-22 09:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there was a while when FE was <300/u on the MOR exchange. people started to make other things at that point


[08-Jul-22 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zeishud**:	At ~300/u of FE I'm not turning a profit....


[08-Jul-22 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	fortunately since you have LM access, I would recommend trying to find someone who needs something smelted for their input processes


[08-Jul-22 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	I'm an AL supplier to a bunch of constructors on Danakil, thats how I pivoted my base to get off of iron


[08-Jul-22 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zeishud**:	FE prices are at a 6 month low....Do you think there is a chance its not going to drop further at this point? Or will it be a decline for a while from now on. I mean I dont't think most people can sustain a profitable FE production with prices lower than 300/u


[08-Jul-22 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	panic: People can not simply dump FEO or FE into space. They have to sell to clear space in their base/warehouse.


[08-Jul-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats when the price collapses to 250/u and people take losses as they pivot


[08-Jul-22 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	It is very heavy to transport so even dumping it -- at loss -- on cx is the best solution. I can sell you som ALO if you want to help


[08-Jul-22 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	ad up  PM when you need more


[08-Jul-22 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	that is a quite generous price as well


[08-Jul-22 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	muhahah


[08-Jul-22 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	I have 1000 ALO and may have my own space issues soon


[08-Jul-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	thats what 2 STOs are for


[08-Jul-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	if you got a few extra I could use a bit of ALO as well. just ran out of the last batch i bought. Prices have sky rocketed!


[08-Jul-22 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	It is fun to watch danakil use 60 AL in a day


[08-Jul-22 09:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	@Olou how much are you looking for?


[08-Jul-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	36 units to keep going for about a day...


[08-Jul-22 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	i could probably spare 252 if you want a weeks worth


[08-Jul-22 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	or up to that. 100/u


[08-Jul-22 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	just got it taken care of. Thanks appreciate it!


[08-Jul-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-22 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Jul-22 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ankou29000**:	Hello, how can we increase the production of an extractor or a smelter? Do we have to build several or can we upgrade them?


[15-Jul-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pu_bot_3**:	You can reallocate to increase production a bit where you need it, but at the expense of something else.  Mostly you just build more.  I'm at 13 smelters right now and I'm sure I'm just small potatoes compared to others.


[15-Jul-22 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jul-22 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	its usually better to refine it farther than shipping it. Highly recommend building an FS


[29-Jul-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Gruff**:	Question for the metallurgy peeps on Vallis. Right now I have 1 EXT:FEO, 1 SME:FE, 1 BMP:PE, 1 PP1:BDE. I've been poking around with the base planners and price sims and stuff, and I think it'd be better for me to remove the EXT and put in a second SME, then pivot to making AL with both smelters. Just looking for some general advice with getting stuff up and running. This makes sense to me, but the amount of ALO I'd have to import might make it not cost-effective with flying ships back and forth. Tips?

***afi** left.*


[30-Jul-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illiterati1**:	Both ALO and AL are fairly light compared to FE so you could probably keep that going a while, particularly if you invested in PP2s. Sell a load in BEN every so often for cheaper SF. At some point it will become prohibitive to move, but you should have decent reserves by that point to expand elsewhere.


[30-Jul-22 08:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gruff**:	what do you mean by prohibitive to move?


[30-Jul-22 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	you cant access the LMs with a triall account. Until then you need to use teh CX


[31-Jul-22 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ButaneTheDwarfKing**:	all you need to do is buy 1 month of the PRO and you will always have access to the LM, even once it expires and you downgrade into a BASIC account. You can still accept orders at that point you just cant post

[01-Aug-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	iron is hard. you can make some money on the LM trading it. If you ship it to the CX you wont make anything


[01-Aug-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	you probably need to switch to AL, you can get the ALO on the CX or post an ad on LM


[01-Aug-22 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Aug-22 03:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Aug-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Aug-22 03:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Lovehungusall**:	I was also at the 2-5 million a week point as him. I had 11 Bases and most of them were full 500 area with some maxed at 1k. My main industry was Chemistry. I would guess I've made the most FLX out of any other individual in this whole universe. (I was also the first person to make/sell FLX this universe to give you a reference on how damn long I've been making it)


[08-Aug-22 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DrTom**:	What is the best way for a new corp to sell FE?


[22-Aug-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nodaz99**:	Take it to CX on Moria Station or LM on Montem. From what I've found.


[22-Aug-22 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and then put in a limit order so i get a good price?


[22-Aug-22 07:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nodaz99**:	You can go just above the bid price on the CX but it might take a bit to sell. On Montem you can go around half way between the market bid and ask price and it will sell quickly.


[22-Aug-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Ah, have to have a look at that then ;) Right now i have one of my freighters on the station to pick up new supplies.


[22-Aug-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	WOuld it be advisable to go all the way to steel for a total beginner? Or does it sell a lot harder...


[22-Aug-22 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	or would I need to at least do my own oxygen for that to make sense ...


[22-Aug-22 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nodaz99**:	Do you have PP1 yet?


[22-Aug-22 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Given that I do not know what tis is... no


[22-Aug-22 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nodaz99**:	i would get one of those running first. Under pioneers in the construction tab


[22-Aug-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	doing my own prefab?


[22-Aug-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nodaz99**:	You should have the Corp group chat now as well. much more experienced players in there  to help.


[22-Aug-22 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nodaz99**:	yes prefab


[22-Aug-22 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	funny. this is one thing I thought to ignore - like: buy building materials when i need them for now, but go more independent on my production chain


[22-Aug-22 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Nodaz99**:	they get expensive quickly


[22-Aug-22 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah, but i think "quickly" is way beyong my planning. my base now has one extractor and one smelter ;)


[22-Aug-22 08:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	jut st f*** up and did a reset today.


[22-Aug-22 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**luckymario8910**:	every time i try to start producing something with the collector at least it displays as halted


[23-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	did you build an HB1 first?


[23-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	you may not have Pioneers


[23-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	yes


[23-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	i have 200


[23-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	is your storage full?


[23-Aug-22 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	but i think i may be 70 pioneers short


[23-Aug-22 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	halted usually means lack of consumables or lack of space


[23-Aug-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	it displays i need 270 required workers but i only have 200


[23-Aug-22 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	and i dont believe i have enough money to purchase all the materials


[23-Aug-22 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the 200/270 will just make it go slower, but it shouldnt stop completely


[23-Aug-22 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	huh


[23-Aug-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	because my storage is very low and ive been trying to just use the collector


[23-Aug-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	for oxygen


[23-Aug-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	hm


[23-Aug-22 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	did you move the consumables (RAT, DW, OVE) from your ship to your base storage?


[23-Aug-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	oh


[23-Aug-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	i have no consumables


[23-Aug-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	ah, that will do it


[23-Aug-22 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	they give ~7 days of consumables in the starter materials


[23-Aug-22 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	i guess i better make a food processor


[23-Aug-22 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	usually its better jus to buy those things here in MOR, the planets here arent great for making food/water


[23-Aug-22 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	ah okayh


[23-Aug-22 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**luckymario8910**:	by the way, are you able to make multiple bases?


[23-Aug-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	you can't make multiple bases on the same planet, but you can expand your base up to 1000m with extra permits


[23-Aug-22 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	you can settle other planets for additional bases

**DrTom**:	Are PWO and COF worth it at the start? I see the price and consumption, bt no idea about the possible productivity gain


[23-Aug-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I would say yes absolutely up to certain price points, depending on what you're making


[23-Aug-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Well. right now iron ore and smelting it


[23-Aug-22 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	your PIOs will be around 79% efficiency with neither, 87% or so with 1, and 100% with both


[23-Aug-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	25% more


[23-Aug-22 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	not nad. yeah, price depending. have to try. for now I have my first supply consumables coming in ;)


[23-Aug-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	works towards making you own PWO., PT, PE, OVE, EXO. It helps.  COF needs MHL which is not sold and hard to make early on


[23-Aug-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	don't make your own, just buy from me :)


[23-Aug-22 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	but yes, making own consumables is a good way to cut costs


[23-Aug-22 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Well, I think I will get into making O first - sems I use al ot in he smelting, in particular fif O want to go to steel.


[23-Aug-22 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	that not only would then reduce my outflow financially, but also seems take out quite a lot of supply route


[23-Aug-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	If you are really good HMS is the goal. Plus it sells well on the market

**Assanova**:	You get to choose


[24-Aug-22 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	In production screen you can tell it what to make


[24-Aug-22 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Ah, so I can only select one then (i.e. O OR H), it does not produce both at the same time. THanks.

**Carefulrogue**:	@MadMonk21, production is running, just flying to town and back to get materials to setup.  Should have a decent steel/iron in a few days.


[01-Sep-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	nice! you're off to a good start! now it's just a waiting game. Or a planning game


[01-Sep-22 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	Vallis is a good place for smelting. You can tell from the excessive smog levels


[01-Sep-22 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ota_Skyworker**:	Hello, i just started a few days ago and probably have many questions but for now can somebody tell me what is this CoGC  project where I can add resources? And what benefits i got from adding?


[01-Sep-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	I would say do not bother. Like at all -- for the next 2-3 months. So then you an contribute witout seting you back weeks.


[01-Sep-22 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	COGC: Click in the planet on "Chamber of Global Commerce"


[01-Sep-22 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	in Planet Info.


[01-Sep-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	yea production! and at least cash based profit


[01-Sep-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ota_Skyworker**:	Yes, I know where. But I cant find or just dont understand what this project is for?


[01-Sep-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	You dont need to contribute to planet upkeep. The governor gets taxes from the planet and purchases all the upkeep needed


[01-Sep-22 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ota_Skyworker**:	ok, thanks.


[01-Sep-22 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Sep-22 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	How can you not understand what it is for? It says "Advertising Campaign: Metallurgy" in blue. Click on it and a window opens that tells exactl what it is about (Metallurgy sector boost 25% for a week)


[01-Sep-22 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ota_Skyworker**:	Actually it was pretty easy not to connect those two. Upkeep talks about 10 days and Programs are every 7 days.

[06-Sep-22 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-22 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-22 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiapet**:	so pretty new to the game just started yesterday still tryin to figure things out


[17-Sep-22 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiapet**:	was not prepared for the the slow pace :)


[17-Sep-22 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiapet**:	but still like it so far


[17-Sep-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	Hello! @Chiapet


[17-Sep-22 04:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	Just started myself, about 30 mins ago :)


[17-Sep-22 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	Just figured out how to send a ship to the commodity exchange!


[17-Sep-22 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	if you started 30 mins ago and jsust sent a ship - then you should have not wasted the fuel. you do right now now need a commodity exxchange but set up your first base and operations.


[17-Sep-22 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	then likely go to th cx and get more supplies-  they DO run short


[17-Sep-22 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Chiapet**:	yes I just did a supply run today myself and am realizing the costs involved


[17-Sep-22 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	First base is extracting ore, 13+ hrs to go. I had 40 FEO in my base inventory, so I sent a ship with 20 FEO to try to sell it, and see about buying material to build a Smelter.


[17-Sep-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	selling feo makes no sense via ship


[17-Sep-22 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	if that is where you want too go (not going straight to fe with a smelter) you need locl buyers or you loose too much


[17-Sep-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the cost of shipping feo basically makes it ridiculously bad. stuff is heavy and has little value


[17-Sep-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you had the 40 feo because the setup for miners advises you to set up a smelter and smelt it down - so you get some feo t ostart doing that ;)


[17-Sep-22 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Olou**:	Need to smelt feo locally.


[17-Sep-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	FE has away higher value and a way lower mass (2 feo become one fe)


[17-Sep-22 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	Okay, so I can buy the materials to build the Smelter locally, instead of at the exchange?


[17-Sep-22 05:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	And abort my ship's current destination?


[17-Sep-22 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
***user2cd26309ca** left.*


[17-Sep-22 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you should have the material


[17-Sep-22 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	unless you did not follow the building steps in - your tutorial


[17-Sep-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	Ah okay, apparently I built a Basic Materials Plant in error.


[17-Sep-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	easiest way: restart


[17-Sep-22 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	liquidate and new beginning


[17-Sep-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	I demolished the BMP, then had the materials to build the SME. Thanks for your help! :)


[17-Sep-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	great then. remember that the smelter works a LOT better if you get FLX


[17-Sep-22 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	with the next supply


[17-Sep-22 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and you may want to go into getting another smelter and a collector asap - that takes the oxygen production out of supply runs (which the smelter uses)


[17-Sep-22 05:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**StevetheNPC**:	I have no idea what you said, but it gives me something to research!


[17-Sep-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	look at the smelter formulas


[17-Sep-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you have 2 for FEO to FE


[17-Sep-22 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	one takes O and C as input (on top of the FEO), the other ALSO needs FLX


[17-Sep-22 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but it has a MUCH better yield (output per FEO)

[17-Sep-22 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Sep-22 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DrTom**:	Jup. I would have assumed the term supply run is common enough knowledge - military, camping etc., sorry. It means going somewhere just to pick up... supplies. A lot is traded on local market or contracts, but you will rely on the nearest exchange for quite some time.


[18-Sep-22 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	SO, it is not jus buying - you buy something on the local exchange it is useless for your base. Needs to be transported first ;)


[18-Sep-22 02:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	wWhich, btw., you can pay someone for. Rent some warehouse, buy stuff, set up a shipping contracts, have somone else ship

[22-Sep-22 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	yes, real time. yes agian double yawn. It can take many weeks to required more than a few minutes a day --- unless you start PLANNING on spreadsheats


[22-Sep-22 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Olou**:	the (49) means that you pull that many workers from the planetary pool. There is a portion of workers reserved in the pool for new buildings. Once the pop report for the planet hit it will either fill all your workers if there is enough or evenly redistribute them among all players

[03-Oct-22 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Soulvenom**:	This simulator is incredibly detailed


[03-Oct-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Atually no. You need place for it (you can rent warehouse space)


[03-Oct-22 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and the goods need to be moved where you want them - but you do not have to do that yourself, you can put up a contract to have someone do it.


[03-Oct-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	Even if you don't have a warehouse the CX will hold onto your commodities for free until you get there


[03-Oct-22 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rubicate**:	when your ship arrives, you have to find the contract for the commodities (one is created automatically when you bought) and resolve it to have the goods pop into your ship


[03-Oct-22 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Soulvenom**:	Thank you both

**MemoryAlpha**:	i had thought about doing it a long time ago but its not worth doing if u cant find 3-4 ppl to make sf and that might be too much production.


[25-Oct-22 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Oct-22 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	well I can fly some up from the station to this planet if you're willing to buy it, but of course the buy price will be inflated by the fuel cost to get it here, so in the end it would be cheaper for you to fly down and buy it yourself??


[25-Oct-22 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I have more OVE for sale in local market


[25-Oct-22 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	I found once you have a chemical planet set up (Circe) It was easy to make NAB and thus SF..  He3 and H are always available at CX for FF


[25-Oct-22 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I havent looked into it seriously, soon as I heard that the market was oversupplied I looked at other products to produce


[25-Oct-22 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I'm talking about Steel STL, not fuel


[25-Oct-22 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	there has been a STL shortage for a bit now, I'm hopeful that some of these new metallurgy people will take advantage


[25-Oct-22 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	im gonna be making some soon. ifk how much extra ill have. if you need o you buy off digginglake at ot-115d


[25-Oct-22 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	ah ok, Ill be setup to start making STL Steel in about a week'. happy to sell it to you locally then


[25-Oct-22 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Same here, I should have STL running in the next day or two, but I'll only be making a few units per day


[25-Oct-22 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	my only warning to STL makers, connect with a local buyer first, as getting it off planet and to the CX is hellish


[25-Oct-22 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Because of fuel costs?


[25-Oct-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	the density of STL makes it terrible to move


[25-Oct-22 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	producing and selling locally will save a lot of fuel for sure


[25-Oct-22 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	oh gotcha that's good to know thank you


[25-Oct-22 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**QuantumOasis**:	How much STL is needed? I have 8 units cooking right now and will be done in about 1h 40min


[25-Oct-22 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	problem with stl is the ridiculous amount of O that is needed to make it. considered going into it - just happy producing fe now and stay there


[25-Oct-22 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MadMonk21**:	I might look to start with like 40-50 units/week, would use them right here on Vallis to make PT


[25-Oct-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah. that is 200 O that is needed. 4 O per STL -  unless somene hasa base specializing on that, this is insance toget here


[25-Oct-22 02:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	especally as we do not have a bonus on resource extraction on vallis


[25-Oct-22 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	newbie here, is it worth it to put collector for O on vallis for STL?


[25-Oct-22 03:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**stilrz**:	in the long run O on vallis is not very profitable.


[25-Oct-22 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	if I build pio hab, how long till I get 100 new pioneers? Also want to confirm that I dont pay any upkeep for unemployed pop

**WildcardWolf**:	Total n00b question: If you buy something at the commodity exchange without setting a storage location, where does it go?


[21-Jan-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Into a contract


[21-Jan-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	the contract is between you and the CX.  Get a ship to CX or rent a warehouse and you can deliver


[21-Jan-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WildcardWolf**:	Cool. My ship is on the way to the CX.


[21-Jan-23 09:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WildcardWolf**:	So it's not necessary to pay to store the physical items at the CX until you get there?


[21-Jan-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	technically, no. But you wouldn't be able to sell anything on the CX until you have an inventory there (i.e. a warehouse or ship)


[21-Jan-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WildcardWolf**:	Ah, thank you so much. Now I understqand why there's warehouse rental.


[21-Jan-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	No but it’s more convenient to have a warehouse, it’s only 100 per week


[21-Jan-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	its a really small amount compared to the Ks and Ms you will be making soon :)


[21-Jan-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WildcardWolf**:	Look out 'verse. I'm about to corner the market on FEO


[21-Jan-23 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	this is why you have a 1000 in other currencies, so you can hire warehouses in each faction if you want to do CX to CX trading.

**BlackAnthrax**:	@Studybreak. that's kinda normal. as you need to buy lots of input materials and ship stuff around. I'm also constantly fluctuation between "i'm able to buy something" and completely broke


[22-Jan-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Cash flow is king for the first couple of weeks, the balance of building up a reserve so you can build goods to build or pfabs to expand is the challenge


[22-Jan-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i am just wondering whether a start as metallurgists is actually viable now. because when i started C prices were fairly low compared to now. I can imagine lots of beginners wouldn't be able to scrape by when paying 600+ for C


[22-Jan-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	remember you do not NEED c


[22-Jan-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	ah, sorry


[22-Jan-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you acutally need it


[22-Jan-23 03:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	not sure. definitely something you need help with


[22-Jan-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	because putting up your own C production is not worth it


[22-Jan-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	at the start. makes a lot of money, but you can not do it on the side


[22-Jan-23 03:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	no with starting capital


[22-Jan-23 03:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	a lot is hard now- we also have lack in h20 and food prices sseem high


[22-Jan-23 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and let's not go into coffee ;) so, may be hard for now - bt then how long will that last?


[22-Jan-23 04:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	also, - you can start as carbon farmer ;)


[22-Jan-23 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	that is just a start package. i sell my carbon surplus for quite good money


[22-Jan-23 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	All the starting packages should ideally be viable though, to be fair, if they're being suggested to new players


[22-Jan-23 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	not possible unless you dynamically change them


[22-Jan-23 04:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the market is a little unusual at the moment - there is no way to make packages static and always viable


[22-Jan-23 04:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ofc you can start as C farmer, but this requires some knowledge about the current market. so unassuming players like me who just go "metallurgist sounds fun" will have to cope with the pain. if you had a friend that tells you "start as C farmer and make bank" would be a fortunate situation


[22-Jan-23 04:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah, that's the thing. starting packages can become a trap if the market shifts into an unfortunate direction.


[22-Jan-23 04:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and yesterday i just realized that even my expansion plans won't work, since montem is completely overpopulated and setting up a chem base there wouldn't really work out :(


[22-Jan-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	Circe is a near-ish alternative for a chem base


[22-Jan-23 04:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	uh, do you have the planet code? too lazy to open FIO right now and PLI is more convenient xD


[22-Jan-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	QQ-001b


[22-Jan-23 04:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	merci. hmm.. no LST though


[22-Jan-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	tip: Type PLI in a new buffer and press enter. You can search using the planet's name


[22-Jan-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that's new to me..thanks :D


[22-Jan-23 04:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I only learnt it a few days ago myself


[22-Jan-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TyraelRaven**:	Nah, but it's got HAL, which is perfect if you want to make CL.NC1


[22-Jan-23 04:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i could use the NA myself for GL though ..mhh


[22-Jan-23 04:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ahh finding the perfect planet for a 2nd base is more pain than i hoped xD


[22-Jan-23 04:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's best if it complements what you're already doing now, e.g. Avalon was a natural choice for me as my first base was on Promitor


[22-Jan-23 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	my main problem atm is that the increasing C price and stable FE prices make FE unattractive to produce.


[22-Jan-23 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I think it makes more sense to do complementary bases up to base 3, then explore other industries (if you want) from base 4 onwards


[22-Jan-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so i offered my SMEs to other players .. so basically contract production / outsourcing xD


[22-Jan-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Yea, I've been contemplating where to go with a proper second base as well.


[22-Jan-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	How about mining ALO and smelting it on Vallis?


[22-Jan-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that was my initial plan


[22-Jan-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	need to find an attractive ALO planet though


[22-Jan-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	first i thought about ementior, but it's so far away


[22-Jan-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Celebdil, Berthier, etc


[22-Jan-23 04:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i went the other way. started with FE, then added consumables (Carbon, oxygen, water) locally


[22-Jan-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	now the second base does the o and h20 and starts eliminating my dw and rat and i can hopefully sell the surplus


[22-Jan-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	reuce my exposure to the market price of input


[22-Jan-23 04:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah i have corp mates selling me DW and RAT on reduced rates. not worth it going in that direction


[22-Jan-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	besides me liking to have that under my own control - the prices are right now quite high. Good enough to make good money selling


[22-Jan-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	additional income stream ;)


[22-Jan-23 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i started with FE, then added occasional C, now I will add O, H20, DW and RAT it seems


[22-Jan-23 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	given how unpredictale the prices are - self sufficiency helps and can generate additional money from surplus

**WildcardWolf**:	Trigger alert: Salty new guy complaint ahead. Are these 'Faction Contract Offers' ever worthwhile? I'm on day 4 here and looking for something to do while I wait for my smelters to spit out a few units of barely profitable material. But every time I plug a faction contract into a simple cost benefit analysis it's laughably out of the question.


[23-Jan-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WildcardWolf**:	I'm trying to decide if I should just wake up and reject them all without reading them or if I will eventually be rewarded with a worthwhile endeavor.

[23-Jan-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WildcardWolf**:	I had a feeling this wasn't going to get better. It looks to me like they are calculated to be profitable if you don't take the return trip into consideration.


[23-Jan-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 01:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	probably same one that kept buying C at 600 instead of making his own


[25-Jan-23 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	making your own is cmplex for some people


[25-Jan-23 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	first they need free space, second they need time to ramp up


[25-Jan-23 01:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i know some people that just do not bother - if your chain ends up high enoug in products, you can afford to pay that much for at least some time


[25-Jan-23 01:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	If you make more profit doing other stuff why build carbon if you can buy, speak as someone who doesn’t build carbon

**Wyper7**:	I started playing when C was in 350-400 range so I got spoiled a bit, but my ship for Vallis always flies full and I can fit more GRN then C on ship too

[25-Jan-23 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	The price of C is driven by the high prices of agricultural stuff, which in turn are driven by the stupid price of water. If you want to normalize things, then dump big amount of H2O at 30 in the CX.


[25-Jan-23 03:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	What amazes me though that people still are price dumping DW. H2O is currently at 50, DW is at 60. If that trend goes on, soon the farmers should water their plants with DW.


[25-Jan-23 03:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	H2O.NC1 vs. DW.NC1


[25-Jan-23 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	But does DW have what plants crave? Electrolytes.


[25-Jan-23 03:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	C price was already rising before the water wars, seems like a gut of FE and PG atm and PE is also at a high price.  All of these are pushing C up as well as the water price


[25-Jan-23 03:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	I wouldn't think the price of H2O on CX would affect the DW price too much, the vast majority of all H2O produced is either used or sold on location (Verdant, Etherwind, Promitor, etc). We're only seeing the excess H2O not meeting the external demand of those that just buy H2O on CX, probably just for FRM's on Vallis/Montem, or even for CL production.


[25-Jan-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Basically, a dedicated h2o supplier could knock the entire price chain down?


[25-Jan-23 03:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Probably 2-3 full RIG bases, but yeah, it's not much compared to the total production.


[25-Jan-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	CL production is minor demand and could absorb a huge H2O rise without impacting profits


[25-Jan-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	As in 2-3 bases to meet the full demand


[25-Jan-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	yeah, CL is a minor one but still worth mentioning I think


[25-Jan-23 03:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Primarily it would be FRM's on Vallis/Montem

[25-Jan-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Yeah, probably a few H2O producers that sell excess H2O would bring down farming prices in Moria and Danakil.


[25-Jan-23 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Trouble would only be finding someone willing to ship H2O, rather than converting to DW and shipping that

[25-Jan-23 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 03:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	But yes, the HSEs are a pain


[25-Jan-23 03:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	noone CAN sell you anything - they only can put an order on an exchange as this is the only place you can accept it


[25-Jan-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	my earlier message indicated it poorly i assume


[25-Jan-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah, but if someone pujts it up the c, someone lese may buy is


[25-Jan-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	isn’t that good for them? I think you meant that theres still the lack of trust if someone was to actually buy it at all in the end


[25-Jan-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	in the end if it were to get sniped because i failed to communicate a proper schedule for the trade to take place then so be it he still profits off


[25-Jan-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	if someone with a 3d printer wants to make an extra 2k or so the next time someone has a ship headed to CX send me a dm ill buy it for 6k

[26-Jan-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The average on CX is about 11k H2O per day over the last 24d (30d, excluding first and last). Maybe over a certain day or two it reached 30k sold in a day, but not on average. And lately it seems to be more of a spike in demand. 4-5 RIG bases to supply the full market seems more accurate though.


[26-Jan-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	maximum in a single day looks to be 40k, about 2 weeks ago. Most days it looks to be around 10-15k

[27-Jan-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFireFly**:	fuel

**Cloude**:	I'm sorry to say this but this isnt an ideal spot for you to start on


[27-Jan-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFireFly**:	yeah there was none


[27-Jan-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	switch to Benten


[27-Jan-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFireFly**:	?


[27-Jan-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFireFly**:	how


[27-Jan-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	there is in the mercantile


[27-Jan-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	COLIQ command just type it in a new buffer


[27-Jan-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TheFireFly**:	k thx


[27-Jan-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	open a new buffer (bar below) and type COLIQ to destroy your current company. then you can create a new company


[27-Jan-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	tbf the game doesn't really let you know much about it before joining.. then you get to hear "you picked a bad start" and need to waste your first COLIQ


[27-Jan-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i was just lucky back then that C was rather cheap and i could make some money as metallurgist.. nowadays i would tell any metallurgist starters to go Food / C

[27-Jan-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	made sure he would atleast learn stuff on his own and hopefully he doesn't need to restart for the 3rd time, if that does happen i'm sure he can find his mistakes

[27-Jan-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	in hindsight going metallurgist was also dumb becuase it's the least attractive job with lots of liquidity issues


[27-Jan-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	but for now i found a way to get a steady cash flow without oscillating between broke and not so broke all the time


[27-Jan-23 06:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	^^^ my biggest mistake is being a metallurgist


[27-Jan-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	I'm doing prefabs, it's basicly a jump between broke and swimming in money, no inbetween lol


[27-Jan-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	already COLIQ once because this profession can go wrong really fast


[27-Jan-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	can't imagine if i was still on the starting phase with these carbon prices


[27-Jan-23 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MoLab**:	Why are carbon prices so expensive? When will they come down?


[29-Jan-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	A combination of factors from H2O prices being up, Mor region being pretty bad for growing crops, opportunistic peoples and such.


[29-Jan-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes but the region was also bad when prices were lower


[29-Jan-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	The area is sparse for water and there aren't any good farming planets. That is the biggest disadvantage. Plus huge demands for C with montem being a chem planet and Vallis being a Metallurgy planet


[29-Jan-23 12:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Jan-23 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Oh its cheaper on Hortus? Thanks for the tipp !


[29-Jan-23 09:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it is also way far out - transport costs have to be paid, and it is a looong way


[29-Jan-23 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and transport is what? 25 per ton?


[29-Jan-23 09:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	more like 20 and if you buy like, what, 10 carbon you already even


[29-Jan-23 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	wll, then do i t ;) just saying - it is not that easy. Not even sure if there are many people doing the trip - starter ship can not reach hortus from here without refueling


[29-Jan-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	the starter ship *can* reach hortus, it's just incredibly expensive


[29-Jan-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Mnementh**:	@Spes91: You are on Trial license, so you cannot set repeating orders. I think at the start you can queue five orders, once an extractor is done it takes the next order from the queue, but once the queue is empty it stops. Do you mean that? With paid license you can set repeating orders.

[01-Feb-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	No no, he provisions 100, then you have to pick it up.


[01-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	The 1200 payment can be made at any time.


[01-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	How it is supposed to work, is provisioning and payment happens in the "same time frame"


[01-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Which is 3 days.


[01-Feb-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Then you have 3 days to pick it up.


[01-Feb-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	yep what he said


[01-Feb-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	otherwise mark on my record.  Welp, let's get this iron to market then.


[01-Feb-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	it will complete after you pay


[01-Feb-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	just drop me a DM if you need more time


[01-Feb-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**ZoyRat**:	Hey. I just started I am looking at my production line and it says that my rextractor order was done an hour ago how to i get it to start on a new order and get my or


[01-Feb-23 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	exstractor


[01-Feb-23 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it automatially does


[01-Feb-23 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	id there are new orders IN THE QUEUE


[01-Feb-23 10:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	they will be taken


[01-Feb-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	if not - what do you exect? As a Pro (license) you can set an order to be recurring, so when it triggers (in the queue) it gets reentered at the end


[01-Feb-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	ya and it just stays at 100%


[01-Feb-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Need to manually put the orders into the ueue


[01-Feb-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	f it just stays at 100% then either it is not finished (rounding error to sohw 100%- what does the time say) or you lack any storage space


[01-Feb-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	given that you startwith soem storage space - an that extractor orders are not that large to overlaod that - there must be space


[01-Feb-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	the time says 1h 45m age


[01-Feb-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	so it still has 1h 45 minutes to o


[01-Feb-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	ya just stated the order this morning then went to work


[01-Feb-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	ago not age


[01-Feb-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	just make sure to get rid if the output before the next ends


[01-Feb-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	iron ore i.e. is very heavy and you have limited weight and space withot more storage


[01-Feb-23 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	i put just transferred 40 iron on to my ship and it still is not doing any thing


[01-Feb-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	what do you mean "stil not doing aynthing"


[01-Feb-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it tells you it takes 1 hour 45 minutes until it is finished


[01-Feb-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	what do you expect in the meantime? Pixie dust?


[01-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	no i think it is already done because it says ago like it finished an hour ago and also the time keeps going up and not down so now it says 1h 49m ago


[01-Feb-23 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	if it tells you it takes anotehr 1 hour 45 minutes it OBVIOUSLY is not done


[01-Feb-23 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	if the time is going up then it is because efficiency was dropping at some point, i.e. when running out of luxury ocnsumables (PRO, COF) and thus now has a lower efficiency


[01-Feb-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and what ou mean 1 h 49 minutes AGO - the timer under the order in the processing slots is not how long it TOOK, it is how long it WILL TAKE


[01-Feb-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	I know that its just the fact that when i started it said "in 15h" now it say"1h ago" like past tense


[01-Feb-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i have never seen ago


[01-Feb-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	that likely means it can not unload


[01-Feb-23 11:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	which means - as I already said - there is not enough storage to unload into


[01-Feb-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	I wish i could show you my screen, but I will just wait and see what happens


[01-Feb-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	because WAITING has EVER, even once, resulted in a computer deciding on different bhavior?


[01-Feb-23 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	do you ahve enough storage?


[01-Feb-23 11:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	I should When I look at my Inventory my volume is less then 1% full ( the yellow Bar)


[01-Feb-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	ok,


[01-Feb-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	AND THE WEIGHT?


[01-Feb-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	because there are 2 numbers - volume and weight


[01-Feb-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	an iron ore is HEAVY


[01-Feb-23 11:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	a little more then my volume


[01-Feb-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	from what you have said this seems to be a support case


[01-Feb-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	257.93/1,500t


[01-Feb-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	how much are you extracting?


[01-Feb-23 11:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and 257.95 of 1500 is NOT 2% or so


[01-Feb-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	14 units( one Order just testing out how the game works)


[01-Feb-23 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yeah, that starts sounding like an error - and thus a support case


[01-Feb-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	how are your consumables? not that it should matter given that if it says "ago" it should be finished


[01-Feb-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	still have water food and work gear


[01-Feb-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	which means you made someting wrong


[01-Feb-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	sprry, no


[01-Feb-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	all 3 of te basics


[01-Feb-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	NO reason for it not t o do something


[01-Feb-23 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	sounds like a support case


[01-Feb-23 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZoyRat**:	all right thx for your help


[01-Feb-23 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	sorry. never seen that before


[01-Feb-23 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	looks like it is not processing the end of production


[01-Feb-23 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it is not a general issue - i had produciton end while we talked actually - so it is limited to maybe extractors.

[04-Feb-23 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aethean**:	all of my stuff is pioneer run. 6 BMP, 4 SME, 1 EXT


[04-Feb-23 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	How the hell are you operating 4 SMEs inside 50 days?


[04-Feb-23 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Yeah just finished my Third BMP, Mostly for PE though, and in between con. stuff. Started my PP2 and POL a Week ago, otherwise it's 3BMP 6 PP1 and 4 WEL right now


[04-Feb-23 08:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I finally have just 25 Settlers working in a PP2 and 875 Pioneers smelting and other stuff


[04-Feb-23 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I had an FS but honestly no demand for the products and tore it down


[04-Feb-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	My total current build is 2 BMP, 2 EXT, 1 INC, 3 PP1, 1 PP2, 5 SME


[04-Feb-23 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	my next builds here will be CHP and POL, then later a WPL and maybe a 2nd INC to fill out the 500


[04-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	POL is so worth it the prices on the CX are pretty high, so making your own PG worth gold


[04-Feb-23 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	POL?  PG?  Sorry, can only look up so fast.


[04-Feb-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Polymer Plant


[04-Feb-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	ah


[04-Feb-23 08:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	with the PP2 and the BMPs PG demand is up and I decided soon after to do a POL


[04-Feb-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	PG is a commonly used plastic product


[04-Feb-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	and since everyone is going for the carbon rush, market soon is gonna come down in like a week, max. 2 , so plastic is not gonna be so pricy to make


[04-Feb-23 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Eventually I found the answers.  You guys are still faster.  hah.


[04-Feb-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	This has been super useful purpdrag, thanks for all the info!


[04-Feb-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I plan to produce carbon just for myself.  A bit more reliable.


[04-Feb-23 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	At present running 1 COL, 1 FRM, 1 INC 1 SME


[04-Feb-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	been a fair bit of trial and error.


[04-Feb-23 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	not a great planet for COL or FRM


[04-Feb-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	no, but to produce my own carbon, eh...


[04-Feb-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I opened a whole other base on Verdant just for the INC inputs


[04-Feb-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	where is verdant?


[04-Feb-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	a FRM here will never produce enough to keep the INC happy


[04-Feb-23 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I think 6 jumps away just outside NCC territory


[04-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	great planet for farming, best in the Moria area


[04-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Is it worth it to build an COL for O to supply SME?


[04-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	no


[04-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that is the other thing Verdant does


[04-Feb-23 08:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	it would be better to just extract and smelt here, sell that stuff and buy the O on the CX


[04-Feb-23 08:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	or do the BMPs and stuff but the planet is set up for metallurgy, which at the beginning is just smelting


[04-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Sorry pretty new, but that is just because the bar for atmospheric is not super big right?


[04-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	right


[04-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	actually quite low here


[04-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	only the Iron Ore is significant enough to be worth it


[04-Feb-23 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	So is Montem kind of crappy for everything then?


[04-Feb-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	compare the bars for O and H2O to Verdant and some other planets


[04-Feb-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	well I would say Montem is kind of average at everything and overall is good


[04-Feb-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	you can get enough of multiple things there to do different stuff profitably


[04-Feb-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I am here because I chose metallurgy


[04-Feb-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	pick your starting planet to match your profession ideally


[04-Feb-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Okay, so for now I should probably just expand SMEs and eventually move to PP1 and BMP to help with expansion and some extra cash


[04-Feb-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	although you aren't really locked into you starting profession in this game


[04-Feb-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	what is your profession?


[04-Feb-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Metallurgy as well


[04-Feb-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	then yes


[04-Feb-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Whyo isn't here...


[04-Feb-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I started with 1 EXT feeding 2 SME,


[04-Feb-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	probably what I should have done, but I'm too commited to my errors at this point


[04-Feb-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I soon added another SME and the INC, but some do the BMP or the PP1, all those are good choices


[04-Feb-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	INC for C I am assuming


[04-Feb-23 09:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	by the time you get there and have all that flowing you will know much better how you want to build things out


[04-Feb-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	yes, it was cheaper when I started but was still my major expense with 3 SMEs going


[04-Feb-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	so I got the INC and then my biggest expense was HCP, GRN, and MAI


[04-Feb-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Do you usually use the FLX recipes? If my math is right with the increased production  you make more money (at least with the FE recipe)


[04-Feb-23 09:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	which led to me looking for a place to farm, thus Verdant


[04-Feb-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I ALWAYS use the FLX recipe


[04-Feb-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Since discovering it, same


[04-Feb-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	from the first trip I ever made to the CX


[04-Feb-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Cool, just switched over to it after making some spreadsheets lol


[04-Feb-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	at ~100 per unit, selling iron for ~380, it works well


[04-Feb-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	been buying ever since but finally I said hey if I have a CHP I won't have to buy that anymore either


[04-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	the FE was consistently selling over 400 for a while so 380 doesn't seem great to me but still makes money


[04-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I'm barely in the black over hte last few months, so 380 is around what I've been selling at


[04-Feb-23 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	granted, I'm not playing excellently


[04-Feb-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	well I routinely travel to Benten or Hortus to sell for more and by inputs for less but the trips cost time and money


[04-Feb-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	usually Moria is the worst place to sell FE


[04-Feb-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	And it's the time that gets me, trying to keep a consistent uptime.


[04-Feb-23 09:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I rotate around it take more planning for the 3 day round trips though and helps to have pro to exchange the money types


[04-Feb-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	right, that's a thing I can do now...


[04-Feb-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	not that I know the strat of it


[04-Feb-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	it remains challenging to keep everything fed and running continuously


[04-Feb-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	and of course metallurgy stuff is heavy so just shutting all that product to the CXs keeps the ships busy


[04-Feb-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	yeah...


[04-Feb-23 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	so all the selling and shopping needs quite a bit of planning


[04-Feb-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	not to mention the bid ask spread so just paying the ask and selling for the bid will kill your profits ...


[04-Feb-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	but thats all you can do at the beginning because you have to get the next load of stuff and get back to base


[04-Feb-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	so another goal is to build up enough cash to be able to leave orders on the exchange so some of them can get sold higher and bought lower


[04-Feb-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Carefulrogue** deleted this message.*


[04-Feb-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	some of them can sit there so long you might have to give up and pay the ask or whatever but it sometimes works


[04-Feb-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	tends to be the problem.


[04-Feb-23 09:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Yeah that has definitely been an issue I also burned through almost all the fuel on one of my ships before I realized I shouldn't max out the fuel consumption since I don't have the money to refuel


[04-Feb-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	anyway I've spent too much time staring at these screens and that is a little of what I picked up in the first few weeks


[04-Feb-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I've learned quite a bit in these chats from experienced players


[04-Feb-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	I appreciate the help!


[04-Feb-23 09:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	a stray thought about the different cashes... are they roughly valued at the same rate?


[04-Feb-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	roughly but about 5-10 variance maybe


[04-Feb-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	All appear to be within 0.9-1.1 of each other


[04-Feb-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	5-10% I meant


[04-Feb-23 09:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	do FXOB NCCCIS etc with the different currency pairs to see the going exchange rates


[04-Feb-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	that a window command?


[04-Feb-23 09:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	trading money generally costs about 5% or if you want to be the "seller" prepare for a long wait


[04-Feb-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	yeesh..


[04-Feb-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	yeah new buffer and then FXOB NCCCIS


[04-Feb-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	yeah... not gonna mess with that for a while


[04-Feb-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	priority one... get back to smelting just vast quantities of iron... or something else


[04-Feb-23 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	simpler to just keep going to Moria then


[04-Feb-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	cheaper too... don't need to mess with FF


[04-Feb-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	pump out the FE and a little STL at first, then decide what to add


[04-Feb-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	that's the plan I think.  first gotta want for some industries to tap though.  I've committed to some errors, and made some plans around them...


[04-Feb-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Yeah, I was going to make STL but at least with the current price it is way worse then FE (if you buy all the raws, idk if you make the FE for the STL)


[04-Feb-23 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	oh well


[04-Feb-23 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I've been making my own FE for the STL.  The Oxygen has been the squeeze point


[04-Feb-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	O is relatively cheap but still the quantities are a challenge, just mix it in occasionally if you can then


[04-Feb-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	I spent all my money on 300 O tbh


[04-Feb-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	holy shit dude


[04-Feb-23 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Idk if that was a mistake but I definitely have enough


[04-Feb-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I"d say so


[04-Feb-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Also buying the COF does improve efficiency enough that it covers the cost


[04-Feb-23 09:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	@purpledragon it's trying to figure what's expensive and what's cheap.  For a newbie, everything seems expensive


[04-Feb-23 09:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	well, teardown in a week  I've all this water now...  will probably just shunt it into some fast grain, and call it good.

[05-Feb-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Feb-23 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	I'll send you a dm


[05-Feb-23 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	There was discussion not too long ago, not a lot of efficiency in producing your own oxygen/hydrogen here.


[05-Feb-23 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NuclearWinter**:	Is that so?


[05-Feb-23 09:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I said that and heard it from others first with specific examples and the short story is that the COL is not close to a good deal on Vallis although people sometimes do it


[05-Feb-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Has anyone looked into taking a loan early game to help build up a production base faster?


[05-Feb-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	in global chat you can see talk about Prunner which lets you see ahead of time how much you would extract on whatever planet


[05-Feb-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I hear of many people doing that


[05-Feb-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that was just in global chat as well


[05-Feb-23 09:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	has to come from a generous/trusting player


[05-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Yeah, I was thinking about it. Just don't want to get scammed


[05-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	they are the ones who would be scammed


[05-Feb-23 09:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	you would just have to convince someone


[05-Feb-23 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	some people will help out new players just for asking but all of that assumes you have Pro or basic because without that they have no way to give you money


[05-Feb-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Okay, I forget you can not fulfil contracts


[05-Feb-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	looks like you are Pro now


[05-Feb-23 09:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Rames1126**:	Yeah I am


[05-Feb-23 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I never asked for it but I saw in chat a couple times where someone was giving gifts to new players and raised my hand for it


[05-Feb-23 09:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	anyway I got to go and good luck see you around maybe

[05-Feb-23 10:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I'm trying to figure a sense of how and when you might want to locally extract O or H or produce H2O or crops... and I think the only answer I've come to is crazy market imbalance.  Like what we're seeing with carbon prices of late.


[05-Feb-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	nope, also to basically HAVE a stable cheaper spply


[05-Feb-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	I do h20 and O loally


[05-Feb-23 10:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	o goes into smelters, h2o well, i did - now i imort) into farms to run incinerators for carbon for the smelters


[05-Feb-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	I moved h20 and O off here to another planet soon - but I did that up to 9 smelters being fed and surplus being sold


[05-Feb-23 11:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the maket is imbalanced AT TIMES and preparation for that does make a certain sense. obviously at some üoint you realize other planets are better - but multiple planets cost a lot of money


[05-Feb-23 11:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I was doing some local production, but I think I'm going to outsource at this point and travel for trade a bit more.  I can manage it.


[05-Feb-23 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	A single collector would be ok if it were meant just for your own convenience.


[05-Feb-23 11:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i think i had 4 at some point and i did not makea lot of suplus


[05-Feb-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I had a collector, rig, and extractor operating all at the same time... was operating in the red I think.  Hav e a farmstead now... going to tear it down and build a second smelter in a week.


[05-Feb-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Like you wouldn't use collectors to get enough to make steel, but if it saves you additional trips to the exchange for O....


[05-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	stee is isane in consumption - yeah, that is likely out


[05-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but care, you say take down A farmstead and build a seond smelter INSTEAD


[05-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	why not just build asecond smelter and start scaling up smelters WHILE using your own carbon


[05-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and you run a large surplus with just one smelter - that is not efficient


[05-Feb-23 11:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Remember, you gotta feed the Smelter with C. And C is big problem for people, especially starting out.


[05-Feb-23 11:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it also is a major cost factoreven if the market is not crazy


[05-Feb-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but one farm can not feed an incinerator - that is why you are red


[05-Feb-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i think i was running 4:1 (4 farms to one incinerator with leftovers) and that is despite using experts


[05-Feb-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	though i used the fast (and input intensive) recipe


[05-Feb-23 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Eh, I'm running an incinerator, but I think it's cheaper just to buy foodstuffs to burn.


[05-Feb-23 11:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	A self sufficiency idea when looking at hte various costs just doesn't work

[05-Feb-23 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Feb-23 11:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Maybe I'll change my mind.  I've a week to think on it, and at worst I change the water to grain rate.


[05-Feb-23 11:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	It's the "here" bit that's getting me though.  I think I might brach ot to one of hte other rocks out there, and start bottling and mining.  Might have more fortunes on some other star.

**DrTom**:	definitely is, but if you are on the "seonc smelter" phase be warned that just OPENING the second base is a MAJOR investment


[06-Feb-23 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and then you better pay someone for tansport as you transport quite empty (though that is fixable fast - oxygen can be used to fill up the space and you can sell it for enough to make it worthwhile)


[06-Feb-23 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but the 2nd base is like a quarter million WITHOUT production buildings.


[06-Feb-23 12:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	this is why I FINALLY opened a second base on Verdant - moving o2, h20 and DW and RAT There (i.e. starting DW and RAT), but the price was eating into my cashflow for am onth

[14-Feb-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	Collecting Oxygen on Vallis is not worth it, you are better off using space for something more useful and just buying O


[14-Feb-23 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	Fertility slider just shows you if you will have bonus or penalty efficiency on your farms, Vallis for example is -10.91%


[14-Feb-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	thx


[14-Feb-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	if there is no fertility slider then you cant grow crops


[14-Feb-23 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Wyper - that may be the case, but it means you are dependent on a supply that may go up brutally in price AND the logistics is something you may not want at the start. I have since moved O production out to my Verdant base.... but Iit worked nicel on Valis as a start, AS DOES FARMING AND WATER FOR THE FARMS


[14-Feb-23 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	allowed me to not think about i.e. the price of C exploding ;)


[14-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Self sufficiency is ok, once you can begin to outsource needs is when you can specialize.


[14-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	1 col can supply 4 sme's generally speaking.


[14-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	For O


[14-Feb-23 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	So it is worth it, as long as the operation isn't too big.


[14-Feb-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	problem is that every piece of land that you use for inefficient farms on Vallis is less land you can use for high efficiency metallurgy industry


[14-Feb-23 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	for example I only have INC here on Vallis and used to import plants from CX before I started growing my own on Verdant


[14-Feb-23 04:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	but for me its also added benefit of weight since imported GRN weights less than C

**Wyper7**:	I dont run farms but I struggle for space here, cant imagine how much space I would have left if had farms here


[14-Feb-23 04:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	@DrTom while I also strive for self sufficiency as much as I can, I find 100% to be inefficient, especially for me with limited space due to FREE license


[14-Feb-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	some inputs have more effect on price and I try to cover them myself, while others are better to take from markets


[14-Feb-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	also I hate JIT so I always keep supply to survive market shocks


[14-Feb-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Gratulations. That is spoken as a player that has multiple bases, NOT as a player that is just starting up where a bad step means ruin


[14-Feb-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you are right, once you open up another planet - it is time to moe. I moved O and H20 off, my farms come next. But as a new player I really liked being less dependent on the price of my inputs to a degree I knew I can make a profit.


[14-Feb-23 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and when C went tthrough the roof, I had a small surplus I could sell.


[14-Feb-23 04:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and 100% self sufficiency is a dream - not worth it. ut you can eliminate the main costs. I am independent now on all inputs of the iron production, and do my own RAT and DW and COF is likely next


[14-Feb-23 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	my 2nd base Verdant is less than month old, and my 3rd is only 2 days old, so I was limited to one base not long ago


[14-Feb-23 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	8 different industries here on Vallis


[14-Feb-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	my first advice is to not have Iron as goal


[14-Feb-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	transform it into something more profitable and transportable


[14-Feb-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I use my iron to make prefabs


[14-Feb-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	like BBH


[14-Feb-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pablo_Noscobar**:	do you go for settlers before then


[14-Feb-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you can make PP1 for prefabs without settlers


[14-Feb-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	upgrading to settler industries is also viable


[14-Feb-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	for example I got couple GF here on Vallis to make glass for my PP2


[14-Feb-23 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pablo_Noscobar**:	do you buy your LST or make it?


[14-Feb-23 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-23 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Check your Contracts.


[15-Feb-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	See if the cx is holding onto the stuff you bought.


[15-Feb-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	You might have purchased too much.


[15-Feb-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Was your ship in dock when the purchases were made?


[15-Feb-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	my ship was at the exchange i assume, i didnt tell it to return to base yet as i needed supplies


[15-Feb-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	and i also rented a wharehouse at the exchange i


[15-Feb-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	i think


[15-Feb-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Check the warehouse then, see if that inventory filled


[15-Feb-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Otherwise Navigate into your contracts and select the order.  If the items are being held, you should be able to click "FULFILL" and it'll dump it into the ship storage.


[15-Feb-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Oh wait, did you hit the Buy price for the order?


[15-Feb-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Or sell?


[15-Feb-23 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

**hhillman**:	rush on CLI? one big purchase a couple days ago, but CX inventory is fuller than when I peeked a few weeks ago


[16-Feb-23 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Nobody had any interest in it until the big purchase and now there are a few people who decided to stock it. I prices have also increased quite a bit too.


[16-Feb-23 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	hmmm. maybe a bunch of people just saw the number go up and wanted to join in. takes a lot of manufacturing time to make use of the CLI


[16-Feb-23 03:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-23 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	so i have to wait


[16-Feb-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	if you click "set" next to the ask price it should match


[16-Feb-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	ty i will try that


[16-Feb-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**shadowsneak**:	it only fails if the quantity is larger than the ask


[16-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**hhillman**:	CLI is a very low volume resource because its uses are very long production time


[16-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Rubicate**:	yes with the command CXOS


[16-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	also why do i have to post an ask price instead of just buying whats already listed for sale


[16-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	and ty for the command


[16-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DrTom**:	basically 25% faster cycle


[16-Feb-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I think of it more like a penalty if you DON'T give them the coffee and puffy overalls, 100% satisfaction is my baseline.


[16-Feb-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	ill get there, just starting. scratch is a little tight atm


[16-Feb-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	yeah PWOs are recommended ASAP, hopefully for ~200 each or less, and the COF is more debatable especially at current prices, depends on your setup


[16-Feb-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	if i have basic and puffy both, do they use them at the same time or better 1st?


[16-Feb-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	at the same time, click on the workforce button in your Base panel to see usage rates


[16-Feb-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	they are consumed as totally separate items at the same time but PWOs at a much lower rate


[16-Feb-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	roger


[16-Feb-23 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	COF is in a weird spot for me.. it makes you produce more yes but you don't get economies of scale from it.. it's even making your production more expensive.. so the net win is the little more margin you get from producing a few items more per week


[16-Feb-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	well, you get more output in the same time, which means the output is cheaper as you need less maintenance per unit and pay less for the workers per unit on other things


[16-Feb-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	all true and if all you are producing is Tier 1 products and COF is at 500 each it is very likely a money loser for starting players right now but I haven't done the math to that detail and each person's numbers are different depending on their specific setup


[16-Feb-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	even 450 each probably not worth it for starting players but I feel less sure about it at that price


[16-Feb-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	when I did my calculations COF was selling for about 380 each


[16-Feb-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	at least when i calculated for FE it was making FE way more expensive than it was traded on CX .. and pushing out more volume wouldn't fix it if people aren't buying for your prices.. let me just enable COF for AL in my spreadsheet and see how that is going


[16-Feb-23 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	just did quick calc and I could produce COF for about 230/u if I wanted


[16-Feb-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	hm, actually with the prices i could get COF for it's viable :o


[16-Feb-23 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	what we're debating is the value of buying COF to bump worker satisfaction to 100%


[16-Feb-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah, in my older calculations it would make produced goods more expensive because COF is traded on quite a high price


[16-Feb-23 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I remember I came to conclusion of worth it


[16-Feb-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	Same


[16-Feb-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	@BlackAnthrax that is what I thought and right now COF.NC1


[16-Feb-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	with a bid of 454


[16-Feb-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	so you can't even get it for 450 at Moria at the moment


[16-Feb-23 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	it was also worth it for me but as I said COF was 380 then and I used that for my calcs


[16-Feb-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	I miss cheap COF


[16-Feb-23 03:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I miss cheap ALO


[16-Feb-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I now make my own but theoretically I guess I should recalculate and maybe sell the COF and not even use it but that is not going to happen because I am stuck on keeping my people at 100% satisfaction


[16-Feb-23 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I'd have a nervous twitch if my people weren't at a 100%


[16-Feb-23 03:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Feb-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	as long as i make money


[16-Feb-23 03:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	question is what is value of your production


[16-Feb-23 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	to me 13% eff is worth much more than about 100NCC increase of COF price


[16-Feb-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	just tried to remove COF in PRUNner and my net profit dropped 2k


[16-Feb-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Feb-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	It should go into it automatically. make a new buffer and type in CXOS, this will show all the orders you've made on the CX, maybe you're orders weren't filled


[19-Feb-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Feb-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Feb-23 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Feb-23 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Feb-23 08:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Hey man, might as well ask.  A great many of us are newish to the game anyways.  We were also at one point lost in the wilderness of weird menus.


[19-Feb-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Ships can only be built. They aren't listed as a separate commodity, you are just going to have to buy/make the parts individually until you can make what you want.


[19-Feb-23 08:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valter_von_Arkonor**:	thats so cool


[19-Feb-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valter_von_Arkonor**:	i figured out i do 98 ncc an hour as a new metallurgist. is there an overview on how much it cost /hr for upkeep of the workforce?


[19-Feb-23 09:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valter_von_Arkonor**:	and are the prices "better" in local markets. ie is the game easier in pro mode?


[19-Feb-23 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Valter_von_Arkonor**:	PRO dont use CE for other than selling stuff at premium price?


[19-Feb-23 09:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

**clanogrady**:	I'll send a dm


[19-Feb-23 09:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	so..that sparked a question


[19-Feb-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	if/when i make a 2nd base


[19-Feb-23 09:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	Prices usually aren't better, just more convenient than the CX


[19-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	does that base come with 2 ships/fuel/prefabs etc like the nub base?


[19-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	no


[19-Feb-23 09:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	A ship is worth much more than a base


[19-Feb-23 09:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	Each ship is at least a couple million while almost no bases are worth that much so they couldn't come with them


[19-Feb-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	I wouldn't make another base until you fill out your first one though by the way


[19-Feb-23 09:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	all good just much needed future info


[19-Feb-23 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	cuz im txc


[19-Feb-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	i feel like im spending more on fuel thatn i should becouse im impatient


[19-Feb-23 09:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	Don't worry I asked questions about things like ships when I first started even though it still hasn't even come up


[19-Feb-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	I would just spend up to 150 fuel per flight to the CX at most. Vallis's orbit is close to the CX right now so no matter what it won't take long


[19-Feb-23 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	But I'm also impatient, most people would spend like 100 or less


[20-Feb-23 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@MrfkngToxic i feel you man. but usually you plan ahead a little and try to fly on the minimal settings + 1 tick of the slider to have the most optimal fuel use. usually STL flights are the ones that take super long

[20-Feb-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[20-Feb-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	it might be because the automated creation of faction contracts are unable to keep up with changing supply and demand


[20-Feb-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Just out of curiousity, why might we prefer to make AL instead of FE and STL?


[21-Feb-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	profit


[21-Feb-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	because PP2 uses AL instead of FE


[21-Feb-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I'm gonna be that daft guy and ask what's the difference?


[21-Feb-23 11:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	where's the advantage, to beter prod the convo


[21-Feb-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	PP2 makes higher tier bfabs for higher tier buildings for higher profits


[21-Feb-23 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	AL is more profitable than either FE or STL per day.  FE is about 600, STL is 2.3k, AL is 3.1k (depending on your experts)


[21-Feb-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	since you need to make FE to make STL, AL is alot more profitable


[21-Feb-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Is that after removing material buy costs?  I'll have to do the math later, but same question.


[21-Feb-23 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Carefulrogue**:	I didn't even have to ask!


[21-Feb-23 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	alright, well, seems I'll start converting to AL manufacturing in the near future then


[21-Feb-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	while its true that AL is better for profit, FE is not as bad as you say, I think people will produce their own FEO rather than import it here on Vallis


[21-Feb-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Those costs then just get deferred into production.


[21-Feb-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Aiming to add, not detract


[21-Feb-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I used to import ALO from Antares while my ships were less busy for about ~70/u including fuel costs


[21-Feb-23 11:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	its probably still profitable if you have spare ship with current ALO prices


[21-Feb-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Looks like I'll need to start buying FF


[21-Feb-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	i just put some alo up on vallis


[21-Feb-23 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	i bring in 550 avg daily


[21-Feb-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	sadly I cant use LM, otherwise I would buy a lot of those


[21-Feb-23 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I was proposing selling on CX (LM not available for all players)


[21-Feb-23 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I am brokish.  I cannot buy that much.


[21-Feb-23 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I recommend sticking with FE as the primary smelting job since we extract FEO here, mix in STL and other things as needed like AL where you will need to import the ALO and smelt it (better) or just buy the AL you need.  Getting a good deal on ALO here is the trick though so it is a good offer.


[21-Feb-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I just demolished extractor yesterday so I can devote more smelters to AL ;..;


[21-Feb-23 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	AL BUY orders posted


[21-Feb-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Fortuitiously AL and FE smelting are fairly similar.  We probably won't lose too much in the dabbling


[21-Feb-23 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	And also fortunately, extractors are somewhat inexpensive...


[21-Feb-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	@carefulrogue just produce FE and when you get some ALO produce AL instead until you run out and go back to FE


[21-Feb-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	AL is more profitable even with these high ALO prices


[21-Feb-23 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Yeah taht's what I plan to do.


[21-Feb-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-23 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Feb-23 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	used to import GRN from CX until I started growing my own on Verdant

**Valter_von_Arkonor**:	how much does a BHP repair the ship? ie when should i use a BHP to repair a ship?


[21-Feb-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	I think 3%? You don’t have to worry about it for a very long time though, I haven’t repaired my ship


[21-Feb-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Divide the number of BHPs in your ship into 100, that the %


[21-Feb-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	yeah I probably remembered it wrong


[21-Feb-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	100/34 is a touch less than 3


[21-Feb-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	should i repair at 90% or 85%?


[21-Feb-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	I think it’s only affected after 80%


[21-Feb-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	mines at 86% and needs 7 bhp, which is why it seems like 2%


[21-Feb-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	It’s only when you drop below 80% that it starts impacting your travel time in a noticeable way


[21-Feb-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	thank you for the help


[21-Feb-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Ignore me it’s 100/48 so about 2%


[21-Feb-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	i always buy workforce consumables that is a multiple of the required item’s upkeep


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	my DW upkeep daily is 24 and i shipped 120 a few days ago


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	did you build some new buildings during that period?


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	No new production buildings were constructed during this consumable cycle since i was just consolidating from an expansion


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	did you build ANY building?


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	Not at all


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	afaik new buildings trigger consumption


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	Odd… I’m still recouping creds from the last expansion


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cloude**:	Does renting a warehouse also trigger consumption?


[22-Feb-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it should not as warehoses are not even part of the base


[22-Feb-23 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Feb-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Feb-23 09:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	I think you can tell it to auto-provision so they can grab the goods right away or if you don't do auto you have to click FULFILL to let it be picked up.  Either way it just disappears from your base storage or local rental unit when it is picked up

[25-Feb-23 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	on a side note, valis is a book trilogy by philip dick<do androids dream of electric sheep<bladerunner>>


[25-Feb-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	not much. a corp mate COLIQed his C farmer start on vallis because of that. if you want C farming it's better to go on a fertile planet and start as victualler actually. push out RATs until you can affort an INC.


[25-Feb-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	@MrfknToxic one FRM on Vallis using 4water GRN recipe can power two INC using 24h recipe for total of 8 C per day and some leftover GRN


[25-Feb-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	or you can just make INC and import GRN or whatever from CX like I did


[25-Feb-23 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-23 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-23 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DrTom**:	Or: READ THE HELP


[25-Feb-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Open Workfroce dialog- ther is a "?" there, that points you to exactly this page. Pretty much all dialogs have explanation of their relevant basic principles.


[25-Feb-23 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the help can be a bit confusing at first, and it's normal to ask each other for answers, I see no reason to shame anyone who functions better learning from peers than handbooks.


[25-Feb-23 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	help in wiki is pretty simple and straightforward


[25-Feb-23 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	sorry for interacting with other players drtom, ill refrain in the future


[25-Feb-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	by which I do hope you mean you'll ignore naysayers and ask for help when you need it because not everyone is the same and you should be just as entitled to ask questions as so many others have been able to do.


[25-Feb-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	yes, i was being sarcastic


[25-Feb-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	good good, just making sure you weren't actually intimidated down =)


[25-Feb-23 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	the sarcasm was clear but what you'd do in the future could go either way


[25-Feb-23 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	nothing wrong with asking questions, I personally do some research myself before I start asking


[25-Feb-23 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and there's nothing wrong with turning straight to people rather than documentation


[25-Feb-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	but to be honest I sometimes get irked by people who just ask and expect to be served all answers without putting any effort themself


[25-Feb-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	it's not exactly a lack of effort when the very act of asking always seems to risk getting people quick to jump on criticizing someone for asking at all.


[25-Feb-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	and not everyone is cut out to search wikis, no matter how straightforward they are


[25-Feb-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	when I was younger there used to be a phrase "google is your friend"


[25-Feb-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	not sure about it these days, but fact is there are plenty of search engines


[25-Feb-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	lmgtfy


[25-Feb-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	And as tracy morgan once said, "I google myself all the time"


[25-Feb-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	now I have to google who tracy morgan is... :P


[25-Feb-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	snl, 30rock


[25-Feb-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	go f'd up by a walmart truck


[25-Feb-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I assume those are some TV shows, and I dont have TV for decades now


[25-Feb-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	got*


[25-Feb-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**clanogrady**:	Questions


[25-Feb-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I'm always happy to help, I just expect people to put some effort into it themself too


[25-Feb-23 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	I mean, it seems silly to encourage people to try to learn the game, but "only if they do it the right way"


[25-Feb-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	there shouldn't be a "wrong" way of pursuing answers


[25-Feb-23 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	dunno what is this "right way" you speak of


[25-Feb-23 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	"looking elsewhere first"


[25-Feb-23 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	i will say this...i had not noticed the ? before it was mentioned, and i was told that by the game in the beginning that it was there i had forgotten.


[25-Feb-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	if i was told*


[25-Feb-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	so the ? button info was def a protip


[25-Feb-23 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	my point was still basically that not everyone functions the same and shouldn't be expected to, that's all.


[25-Feb-23 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	tell me, when you buy new stuff do you read the manual or skip it?

**MrfkngToxic**:	depends on what it is, a simple revolver no, an import semi auto yes


[25-Feb-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	would you classify this game as simple revolver or import semi?


[25-Feb-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	how about, no one person's answer to that question matters because everyone is different, and it also ignores the question of if there's other people nearby who already know how to use the thing that you could ask for pointers more readily anyway.


[25-Feb-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	you shush :)


[25-Feb-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Yes. GOod attitude. Give him a fish, soe he never learns to fish and stays hungry.


[25-Feb-23 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	oh good grief. it's a game, and a quick question, get over yourself.


[25-Feb-23 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	asking for help is so clearly shameful and to be avoided at all costs.


[25-Feb-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Oh god, it is agame - please do not shame the education you got from your parenty. This is getting quite disgusting, sorry.


[25-Feb-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	i think we all should log out for 20m drink a beer and relax


[25-Feb-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	what in the world. you're making a big deal and then scoffing at *me* for getting weirded out at what a big deal you're making about it


[25-Feb-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Yeah. what in the world - takeover of whimsies. Grats.


[25-Feb-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	whimsies?? so, what, you *do* think this should be sooper sureeous hardcore?


[25-Feb-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	sheesh


[25-Feb-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-23 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	nope


[25-Feb-23 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Opalesce-Spectrum**:	heh, because I don't drink beer and I don't feel like vodka right now, sorry :P

[26-Feb-23 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	Best faction contracts are to get X amount of certain stuff, but still they are like lottery so make your calculations to see if its trash or jackpot

[26-Feb-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	am i blind stupid or most likely stupid


[27-Feb-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that is correct


[27-Feb-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	am i blind or stupid or both is what i meant to say, so obviously im a super-genious


[27-Feb-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	the only things carbon can ever be made from (and it can only be made not mined) is GRN, MAI, and/or HCP.


[27-Feb-23 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	all C in the universe came from them via INC


[27-Feb-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	that is kind of funny when I say it that way


[27-Feb-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	essentially Earth is probably the only "natural" source of carbon.  Which it sounds like it was all used up just to get to this point.


[27-Feb-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	crazy universe here


[27-Feb-23 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 08:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Feb-23 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	No, ZPM's might not provide enough power, we should switch to using Arcturus devices... just preferably not on any of the main planets for now.


[27-Feb-23 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	do you want to get us all killed? stick to ZPMs... much safer


[27-Feb-23 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Mar-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	burning your workers for carbon is so inefficient... you have to first take out the organs, skin them to make hats and use meat to make protein paste instead of that algae crap


[01-Mar-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127

**purpdrag**:	I make a fairly consistent profit off of faction contracts although not a large profit.  Only about 10% of the time do I reject all three.  Provision contracts are the ones most likely to turn a profit and it is fairly easy to calculate profit based on CX prices and I don't go out of my way for it just accept if I can profit from buying it on my next scheduled CX trip.  Sometimes I do a combo of buy some and produce some.  Anyway, that is my take.  Shipping/exploration contracts are rarely worth it but have worked a few times for small profits.  Even then only worth it because it was "on the way" to somewhere I was already going anyway.  Honestly barely worth it to just land and take off somewhere usually, but I made a profit nonetheless even after fuel and damage costs.

**BlackAnthrax**:	the problem with having only 2 ships is: you either need to contract other people with more ships at hand to fly for you, or stay small enough so you don't get throughput constrained


[10-Mar-23 03:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I used PRUNner to calculate my daily input/output weight for each base


[10-Mar-23 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	its one of reasons why I dropped my dreams of metallurgy


[10-Mar-23 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Same, but that's only half the job. I'm not there yet but I also want to set up a schedule so I can supply my bases on different days so reduce the need for more ships


[10-Mar-23 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	But one ship is constantly flying between prism and cx for a corpmate. Nonstop. So technically i have only 1 ship at hand


[10-Mar-23 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	then you might redo deal with your corp


[10-Mar-23 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	It's a mutual beneficial deal, until he gets his WCB


[10-Mar-23 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you know best what is good for your company

**Tethraine**:	i started as metallurgist


[11-Mar-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LordGwyn**:	there's a different path through the menus to build without needing SEA


[11-Mar-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tethraine**:	how


[11-Mar-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	you shouldn't need SEA for vallis


[11-Mar-23 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	there's been a bug w/ the new update where it mistakenly does that sometimes, try waiting a bit and restarting prun to see if that fixes it


[11-Mar-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Tethraine**:	so i came just at the wrong update


[11-Mar-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	like i said, should fix itself


[11-Mar-23 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Mar-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so AL is basically -+0 in best case atm


[19-Mar-23 07:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	people probably buy the ALO to make their own AL, so higher demand for ALO but less for AL


[19-Mar-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BeBopLula**:	OneTry (OneCon)'s prices!


[21-Mar-23 04:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Danakil is primarily a Construction world, you hence get a bonus for building prefabs such as BSE, BBH, BDE


[21-Mar-23 04:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	to build these items you will have to import most of the goods


[21-Mar-23 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	all give about the same profit at the moment and all sell well


[21-Mar-23 04:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	if you let us know what your starting profession is we can help and guide


[21-Mar-23 04:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	a top tip is to sell all the SF fuel from your second ship at the CX in Moria to rasie extra cash


[21-Mar-23 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	you will not need the cargo space from the second ship for a few weeks


[21-Mar-23 04:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You will need the FF fuel however so dont sell that


[21-Mar-23 04:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	if you decide to go PRO then there a lots of opportunities to do cargo runs.  Especially shipping goods from Moria CX to Danakil


[21-Mar-23 04:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	as a general rule none of the resources on Danakil are worth extracting/mining.  This does make Danakil a difficult world to start on, if you get building prefabs quickly you will prosper but otherwise it will be slow


[21-Mar-23 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	with this game, cash flow is very important.  Dont spend all your money on expanding, you need consumer goods to keep the factories working so make certain you have enough cash for the next purchase


[21-Mar-23 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	im appear to be going very crazy, this is the Vallis chat and I thought it was Danakil!!


[21-Mar-23 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	okay ignore the majority of my advice whilst I go and sit in a corner somewhere


[21-Mar-23 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	for Vallis,  build FEO extractor and SME to get started with FE.  Add SME until you have sufficient SME to use all your FEO.  Build PP1 to turn FE into Prefabs.


[21-Mar-23 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	SI is currently the most profitable metal to smelt


[21-Mar-23 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	FE is not very profitable but is always in high demand


[21-Mar-23 05:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	buy O it is not efficient to collect O on Vallis


[21-Mar-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lacyluc**:	thanks i am metallurger have now build 1 EXT and 1 SME


[21-Mar-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	also worth adding that the planets and CX are constantly moving so the distance between them does change


[21-Mar-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	at the moment, Vallis is a long way from the CX.  in about a week's time it will be a lot closer and so fuel cost will be lower.


[21-Mar-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	remember at the beginning you may want to pay for transport or also take contracts (requires pro or basic)


[21-Mar-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	because you do not mnage to be anywhere close to efficient with your cargo space


[21-Mar-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	you can see the current locations in a new buffer with the command MS OT-580


[21-Mar-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	to be honest this is the absolute most expensive time to be travelling between Vallis and Moria CX


[21-Mar-23 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lacyluc**:	well i have quite some fuel with 950 SF and 350 FF


[21-Mar-23 07:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	you really need to avoid using too much fuel.  It will be your biggest expense to start with


[21-Mar-23 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	even though you get 3000 units of SF free at the start, with each unit costing about 15 NNC, you can burn through your cash very quickly by goin g faster


[21-Mar-23 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	its very slow but use the slider to reduce fuel usage to min or one click above min


[21-Mar-23 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	it should cost you about 56 SF to go to Moria CX at min, 71 at one click, 85 at 2 clicks


[21-Mar-23 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	but appreciate even at 2 clicks that is still nearly a day's journey


[21-Mar-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	it will get faster and cheaper to do this journey but atm it is a little bit of a killer for a starter

[21-Mar-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Febito**:	Quick question. Worth investing any amount of time with free license?


[21-Mar-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	pro/basic is a big advantage from the start.


[21-Mar-23 10:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you can do it on trial


[21-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	being able to use the lms and make money on shipping requests is really strong early game


[21-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	on trial theres no way to make money outside the cx


[21-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Febito**:	basic is not trial version?


[21-Mar-23 10:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	basic = free version after you buy 1 month of pro


[21-Mar-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Febito**:	oh, so buying one month upgrades you one level above free but lower than pro?


[21-Mar-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you cant list sells on the lm as basic but you can accept buys or contds from others


[21-Mar-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	yes


[21-Mar-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Febito**:	so basicaly with basic, you play by other peoples put prices while pro is the ones dictating prices ? :D


[21-Mar-23 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	i didn't fly to my first base for nearly 2 months when i started. i just took shipping requests.


[21-Mar-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	yeah on the open lm. a lot of trading is agreements made in advance though


[21-Mar-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you will get further faster if you work with people vs trying to ship everything to the cx and playing solo


[21-Mar-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Febito**:	right.


[21-Mar-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Febito**:	so if im not PRO license its playing with npcs ?


[21-Mar-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	theres no npc


[21-Mar-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	the cx is real people too but you have to ship goods to it


[21-Mar-23 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	vs selling for similar prices onsite


[21-Mar-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	vallis is mostly heavy goods it eats up your ship time


[21-Mar-23 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	there's a lot of zero shipping bases when you partner up


[21-Mar-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Febito**:	hmm okay. but i can just produce smth. ship it to cx. and sell it there for profit ? thats doable on free licence?


[21-Mar-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	yes


[21-Mar-23 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MrfkngToxic**:	im free, on valis, and doing FE mining smelting...my profits are slim vs expenses but i am making money and expanding, albeit slowly right now but i can easily see the snowball coming


[21-Mar-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	access to the lm would be nice but meh maybe i will buy a month of pro maybe i wont idk yet


[21-Mar-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	i currently use my ships as 1 way ferries to the cx, meaning 1 is at my base and 1 is at  the cx, that way i dont have to wait for round trip times for supplies or profits


[21-Mar-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	make it 15 (I use and consume multiples of 15) and i can jsut send you a clontract now. 500 per unit.


[21-Mar-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	problem is also a bit of financial shortfall.  Might be a few days before I can pay in full.


[21-Mar-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	how many?


[21-Mar-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	7? 14?


[21-Mar-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I've got 6k NCC on hand.  I can do you for 12 units if ammicable


[21-Mar-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i was saying time


[21-Mar-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i need a number to put into the contract - i am ok with waiting a week or two for payment


[21-Mar-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	A week is fine


[21-Mar-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's just some small consumables, nothing too wild


[31-Mar-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	just a lot of small orders


[31-Mar-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	@Carefulrogue you are playing for more than half a year and still have to race the upkeep clocK? Dont you have few weeks worth stockpile of consumables at least?


[31-Mar-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i dont have multiple weeks of stockpile either


[31-Mar-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	just a week


[31-Mar-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I keep my stockpile in 1 to 3 week range


[31-Mar-23 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	so when I reach 1 week left I restock to 3 weeks


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	no way i could afford 3 weeks of inputs at once


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I didnt fill my stockpile all at once


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i probably could, but be on the verge of bankrupty if i don't immediatly sell everything produced


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	it would cost about 610k for me


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	@Badger you are playing almost a year, what did you produce and sell all that time?


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	ive only ever done FE


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	not high profit


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I stopped selling FE after 2 weeks of playing


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	turned it into BBH for easier transport


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	ive considered running some PP1s


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	but i like the efficiency gain from specialization


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i stopped FE completely and import ores to smelt


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	because FE is just terrible margins


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I was smelting AL for months


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	im trying to make the money with volume


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	now I plan to demolish all SME due to ALO.NC1 prices


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	well i have still 1112 ALO stockpiled XD


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	badger problem with FE is that you cant put a lot on a ship so fuel costs cut into your profits as well


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	what are people doing with the AL?


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	only 288 ALO left, after that its OVER


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	oh i sell almost exclusivly on LM


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i sell mine directly to a friend who turns them directly in to LParts


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	ah


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	but you still have to run your ship to CX to resupply


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i think lots of people from steam are now in the area of LParts so the demand is incredibly high, thus the price hike


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	ya but those arent hard to move


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	ship does fly empty one way tho


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i tried negotiating with people on Celebdil. but no chance. none of them export ALO


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	my export from Vallis is very light bfabs, lfabs and glass


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i'd love to have a secondary base on montem. but it's so crowded there


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I wanted montem base long ago, but too late now


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah had i known that metallurgy was going to be lots of trouble, i would have done the constructor start at montem into chem


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	thank god for circe


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	circe doesnt have LST tho


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and this is by far my biggest import


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	who cares about LST


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	CL.NC1


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the montem base would be perfect because then i can focus circe completely on CL based recipes


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	if I had montem I would move my POLs there and focus circe on LABs


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i sold CL before i had the labs.. it's worth a lot, but doesn't sell all that well.


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	had to wait for long times often


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I have lots of liquidity so I can afford to wait a lot


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i don't xD


[31-Mar-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i really need to sell shit within a week


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	but my LABs use most of my CL production now


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	about 20/d


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah in the end EPO and DDT are worth more than CL


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	DDT.NC1


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's a 1:3 recipe


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	with current prices I like PG more


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	PG doesnt need CL


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	MG instead


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	also now I'm producing THF.NC1 so got some extra CL to put on CX


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah THF is also on my bucket list


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and it uses NA that is flooding my base lol


[31-Mar-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Mar-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Frankly, I think I average at break even, but like others, I bid on the local market and see if I can get someup to jump up and grab the FE or AL at a premium, before dropping to make a quick buck


[31-Mar-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I didn't much use the tutorials, I just... figured it out.  Slowly\

[01-Apr-23 09:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	at the least I can make my repairs locally.


[01-Apr-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Though, is there a good nearby market for buying consumables?


[01-Apr-23 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	for me there is only CX


[01-Apr-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	moving to pp1 from just selling FE is good, you will be able to move more stuff with your ship so less trips and saving on fuel costs


[01-Apr-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Eh, different expenses.  was producing AL too, a bit more prosperous. Will probably keep producing some, if there's space in a return haul.


[01-Apr-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	AL was super good when I was buying ALO for less than 50


[01-Apr-23 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	but now I would rather just buy AL than make it myself


[01-Apr-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	yeah... right now the market ain't great on 'em.


[01-Apr-23 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I was buying ALO for up to 200, hoping it would stabilize eventually but I had enough of waiting


[01-Apr-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	and my ships are too busy to run to other CX


[01-Apr-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Yeah, soundly jump back to iron


[01-Apr-23 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	going back to FE from AL is regressing


[01-Apr-23 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I'm not going to tell you how to play, but if you want more money FE is not the answer


[01-Apr-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Sounds like an awful lot of telling, and not a lot of grasping of the strategy.


[01-Apr-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Flinter**:	i had to switch to making steel since iron is just so saturated


[01-Apr-23 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Are steel prices high enough to justify that?


[01-Apr-23 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	haven't run the math, but the cost of running steel with the O and FE inputs feels... insufficient.


[01-Apr-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	at least, I suppose, for the rates I was seeing for selling.


[01-Apr-23 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	Honestly pretty much whatever type of metal that your smelting metallurgy just doesn't make much money by itself. The main purpose of smelting metal yourself seems to be so that you ca use the metal yourself without shipping it from the cx


[01-Apr-23 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	interesting.


[01-Apr-23 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperormouse**:	At least if your making something like iron which makes really bad money, the main reason to do it is because you want to for example turn it into construction prefabs without shipping all that heavy iron to your base

[01-Apr-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	i think the base size scaling is going to kill me tho


[01-Apr-23 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	140


[01-Apr-23 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	a new base gives you 500 area but expanding a base only gives you 250


[01-Apr-23 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	so i think im at an inherit disadvantage with this strat


[01-Apr-23 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I produce 250 glass/d here


[01-Apr-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	so why Vallis for glass?


[01-Apr-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	metallurgy bonus


[01-Apr-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	are the planet bonuses offsetting shipping?


[01-Apr-23 12:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	glass production costs come from consumables more than inputs


[01-Apr-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	inputs are 2 SIO and 1 NA for 10 GL


[01-Apr-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	glass in general is easy on shipping due to low weights


[01-Apr-23 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	i forget not everything is as painful to ship as fe


[01-Apr-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	FE forces you to make more trips with ship and that costs fuel


[01-Apr-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	also you cant move many at once


[01-Apr-23 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	not to mention every newbie that starts here produces FE so market is saturated


[01-Apr-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	i would have to fly alot faster if i moved all my fe to the cx


[01-Apr-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	i sell almost exclusivly on lm now


[01-Apr-23 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	you still have to import C I guess?


[01-Apr-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	mostly, i have a friend who recently started in the carbon business


[01-Apr-23 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	but his output is not enough yet


[01-Apr-23 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	i import O and FLX as well


[01-Apr-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	I actually had few INC here on Vallis just so I can import GRN instead of C to reduce weight of my import


[01-Apr-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Badger**:	did you import water as well?


[01-Apr-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	no, just GRN

[01-Apr-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	its not


[01-Apr-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Carefulrogue**:	There are a fair few local C producers.  Though the fluxuation in product prices makes it iffy


[01-Apr-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cervus**:	Should you have a planet near CX for all of your manufacturing, or should you put refining/manufacturing on planets that make the raw resources?


[01-Apr-23 08:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Depends on your shipping capacity - the more shipping you can spare, the further out you can build


[01-Apr-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	And if you have the contacts who will buy off you locally elsewhere.


[01-Apr-23 08:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Some players try to have everything in the production chain in the same base to simplify logistics, while others try to take full advantage of the CoGC production bonus (i.e. only build the specific industry on that planet)


[01-Apr-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Room to experiment too.  I would shy away from suggesting there's one strategy that will work without fail.


[01-Apr-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Assuming you smelt your own FE on Vallis, it may make more sense to expand into the construction industry on planet even thought the CoGC is for metallurgy simply because moving FE is a pain


[01-Apr-23 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'll have 2.7kt/880m3 available from Vallis to MOR, leaving in 5 hours

[18-Apr-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Apr-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Also, as a freemium guy, you're limited to two ships (not a problem initially) in flight .  So keep that in mind

[18-Apr-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Primaner**:	Thank you! :)


[18-Apr-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	doesn't tell you the cost, which of course varies widely but you can figure 500k+ to upgrade starter to a larger cargo bay and about 1.2 - 1.5 mill or more for a medium to large cargo FTL ship, if you can find the parts at an average price


[18-Apr-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Primaner**:	Alright thanks! These numbers are far away :D


[18-Apr-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	yeah, that's the main point, and with efficient logistics (and depending on your product and many other variables) the starter ships should be able to keep up with shipping needs for starter base plus 1 or 2 other size 500 bases before you'll be limited by shipping capacity and need a ship upgrade or new ship


[18-Apr-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	you'll have time to figure it out and plan way ahead to decide how, when, and where to start gathering the parts

[21-Apr-23 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	they can sometimes work if they are right on the way or super close and the planet is easy and low damage to land and take off from.  You can test fuel and damage costs using btf command, or test from blueprint if your ship isn't available right away to do that.


[21-Apr-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	even at best they barely profit after fuel and maintenance costs it seems though


[21-Apr-23 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Primaner**:	Alright ok thanks!


[21-Apr-23 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	in summary I rarely take the survey contracts, but the shipping ones are now offering from base to exchange after the latest update, which often works nicely.  Other shipping ones are rarely worth it, same math basically as the survey ones.

**--SCHAITR--**:	BUI xxx and MAT xxx are the most helpful commands - substitute the xxx with whatever you're looking for


[24-Apr-23 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	and if you make mistakes, you can restart using the COLIQ command


[24-Apr-23 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The game has a steep learning curve, so do ask questions whenever you have any :)

**RickyBobby22**:	I'll take some time to mess around for sure, thanks for the tips! time to mine some iron


[24-Apr-23 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Wyper7**:	selling iron can be a pain, I suggest you think about making BBH out of it first eventually

**RickyBobby22**:	If I want to make BBH should I have started on Montem instead of Vallis?


[24-Apr-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	You always can try to get LST from the CX, weighs a lot less than FE in that regard, but montem would been the best start for self sufficent Prefab Part Priting


[24-Apr-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RickyBobby22**:	Thanks for the reply. Currently just mining FE on Vallis, is there reasonable progression from here or would I be better of hitting a restart to start on Montem?


[24-Apr-23 06:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RickyBobby22**:	Still my first day btw


[24-Apr-23 06:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	I personally started as a Constructor on Vallis. If you wanna go full on BBH BSE etc then montem COULD be better, but it's chem focused for the moment. On the otherhand, importing LST is cheaper than importing Iron from the weight factor. Take the first days to look around a bit, see how the market and your own produktion works, and if you feel you ran yourself in a corner, you can just COLIQ and restart on montem


[24-Apr-23 07:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Glitchinthemaschine**:	And most people in the Global and Lokal chats are happy to help with questions normally :)


[24-Apr-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RickyBobby22**:	Alright, that's what I'll do. I'll take the next few days; see how things go, then reassess.


[24-Apr-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RickyBobby22**:	I really appreciate the helpful community, it's a huge change from playing mostly single-player games like Stellaris, EU4, etc.


[24-Apr-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Krokiet**:	I started as metalurgist on Vallis but mostly switched to construction with my own FE supply. If you decide to go this path remember that you need to sell some parts that you produce and not use it all for new buildings as you need to buy things to keep production


[24-Apr-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Krokiet**:	The only decision point here is that it's probably impossible to setup a base on Montem later on as it is over it's capacity so only a new fist base can be setup there


[24-Apr-23 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RickyBobby22**:	Construction seems very complex at the moment. I'm still unsure of transit times, build times, and any other time sink process. still waiting on my first 14 units of FE lol.


[24-Apr-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RickyBobby22**:	Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime or would I be better off coming back when my extraction is complete?


[24-Apr-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Krokiet**:	You can play around with the interface to fell more confident. You want to wait till you produce FEO then it's smelted into FE and you can ship it to the Moria Station for sale


[24-Apr-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Krokiet**:	Reading the handbook can also help


[24-Apr-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**RickyBobby22**:	Alright, will do. I'll watch some guides between now and then. See you all later :)


[24-Apr-23 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Krokiet**:	then when you feel comfortale you can build PP1 to turn your FE into prefabs BBH/BSE


[24-Apr-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Krokiet**:	But you will need to bring LST from Exchange apart from just food/carbon/oxygen

**purpdrag**:	or add another SME, I added a second SME almost right away, then over time went to a 2 EXT to 5 SME setup that required mixing in steel or supplementing additional ore.  You can also shift around your experts once you have more to balance the flow rates.  I also did an INC early to produce C onsite but not critical now that C prices are reasonable again.  I put in the first PP1 early as well and soon added another, then much later, another.  So awesome to build your own buildings and you think you can also sell the bfabs, but I never did so far. I just keep using em and using em.

**purpdrag**:	so yes, PP1 would be my recommended build right now after your initial EXTs and SMEs as a Metallurgist on Vallis.  So nice to "build your own buildings".  Maybe get 2 EXT, 4 SME going or something like that and you can support at least one PP1 without ever selling any of the Bfabs.


[15-May-23 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**purpdrag**:	or should be able to at least, just continuing to sell FE

**Arcetro**:	What is a profitable unexploited niche in Moria? Any suggestion?


[15-May-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	none i think xD


[15-May-23 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the planet is overpopulated .. so someone will do something for sure. building prefabs is always in need as purpdrag said.


[15-May-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcetro**:	so where do expansion play at? How is the expansion mindset in this?


[15-May-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so technically the expansion is limited by your numbers of permits (you start with 2 permits)


[15-May-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcetro**:	oh


[15-May-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcetro**:	at what point you need PRO?


[15-May-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the first permit on a planet grants you 500 area, the 2nd one 250 and the 3rd one also 250 .. to a max of 1000


[15-May-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcetro**:	then PRO?


[15-May-23 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	IIRC HQ level 5 is achievable without PRO. let me check really quick

**Arcetro**:	great info


[15-May-23 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcetro**:	also, there are clans/corps? is someone recruiting?


[15-May-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	Hayo :D


[15-May-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah HQ max level without PRO is 5. so you can have 6 permits.. generally as you can see it's better to use a permit to create bases at new planets. but bear in mind that as a beginner it might make sense to just build up to 1000 area on your starter and eventually tear stuff down to use the permits for other planets


[15-May-23 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	But you keep all HQ upgrades if you revert back to Basic after one month of PRO.  So if you are not rl wealthy, you can build a stock of pfabs, go PRO, upgrade HQ


[15-May-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Arcetro**:	thats actually a great tip. How corps/clans work here?


[15-May-23 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	They kinda don't. As in, there's no real functionality to them, except the corp tag at the start, and for distributing governeur taxes (which in turn means that 99% of all planetary governeuers 'leave' their corp to make a dedicate one to make tax accounting easier)


[15-May-23 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Alblaka**:	(Oh, and the Corp HQ building, I guess.)

**Mnementh**:	@Tek_Sten: dunno if your problem is solved already, but if you still need your inventory you can look to the left side of the screen, it has multiple buttons, click on the one titled 'BS' (Bases), which opens an overview of all your bases which for you currently is only the one, there click on view base and you get a view with multiple buttons, one of which is inventory. You can drag and drop the content of your buffers into an empty area of your screens to have it there permanently.

[16-May-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	sorry how long*


[16-May-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	cause it looks pretty costly


[16-May-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it is


[16-May-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	2nd base is a brutal investment


[16-May-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	any tips for a beginner?


[16-May-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	so far looking into manufacturing


[16-May-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	didnt choose the best starting planet i must say


[16-May-23 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	not really. well, do not got for a seond base until you can afford it  you may want tofill up your base, then add licenses to it


[16-May-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	less efficient than another base, but the start cost is something you may want to push a little to the back


[16-May-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	make a profit, then ask for someone to give you a helping hand ;)


[16-May-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	my planet is full, does it mean i wont be able to add licenses or is that differnet?


[16-May-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	2nd license means you asdd 250 land


[16-May-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	irst is 500, next to are 250 each. 3 licenses max on a base


[16-May-23 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	i see thanks


[16-May-23 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	also, worth doing the starter contracts?


[16-May-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	@shrewdsun do your math


[16-May-23 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	but mostly yes


[16-May-23 03:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and transport contracts are always worth it if you have space (but check that its going to the cx as some go elsewhere)


[16-May-23 03:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	also you cannot be full with a 19 hour old account


[16-May-23 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i think s/he meant the planet is not having free plots XD


[16-May-23 03:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	well you could make food - then verdant


[16-May-23 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	or moria and build fabs or chemistry


[16-May-23 03:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-May-23 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-May-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	I am currently planning the same, so I start looking into it. You can type BLU in a buffer, there you can design your new ship. Your starter ship is already there as a blueprint. On Pallada is a shipyard, once you have designed your blueprint, you can go to the shipyard (SHY OT-580d) and select your blueprint. You need the parts fly to Pallada. To save you can upgrade your current ship, by selecting the starting blueprint and the target blueprint.

**MrfkngToxic**:	ty


[22-May-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	The big problem is: as people build ships seldomly there are no offers on the CX for a lot of parts.


[22-May-23 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	i have a feeling that i have no where near enough credits now that ive seen the mat list


[22-May-23 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	if even available as you said


[22-May-23 07:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Mnementh**:	Yeah, my plan changed from building a third ship to upgradfing one of my starters. As I understand it I have only to provide the difference in materials.


[22-May-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Wekk, a ship is in the millions - hyperdrive being a large part of that. I was quoted around 6.5m for a large cargo hauler


[22-May-23 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	upgrading the first 2 ships is a LOT more cost efficient and should be done first, as you generally do not touch the engines.


[22-May-23 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Larger tanks, LHP hull plates and cargo update are basically it


[22-May-23 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i got that, ewith heavy cargo bay (1000m2, 3000t) for 1 million each


[22-May-23 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ships are also incredibly expensive. I'm currently working on creating a WCB for myself. that alone is about 300k . then you need additional thrusters and whatnot for the upgrade.

**DrTom**:	I would not say they are THAT expensive. as I said, i got upgrade ackages with all included for a million each, which is not low, but you can anage quite some time without - I am now running 4 bases and it started to get critical only when those are filled up.


[22-May-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	now starting to expand more and likely get a 2000t build at some point, but till then ;) they should suffeice


[22-May-23 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Talking about WCB. Anyone here got a SKF on Vallis and would create one for me if I deliver the material? It's not worth it for me to build my own SKF


[22-May-23 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I’m doing my absolute best to correct the lack of ship parts on the market, im up to 4 FLT drives a week and will be looking to build equal of the other parts based on that output over the next few weeks


[22-May-23 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Black I’ll take that order (well I’ll take your AST and sell you a MCB).  DM me


[22-May-23 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Sorry you wanted a WCB, I can do that as well just few days to get one built


[22-May-23 10:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	The problem with buying ships is that those who can need them. So you end up with no excess being sold


[22-May-23 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I’m currently sorted, four ships is good for my set up.


[22-May-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	i feel like i'm a few months yet from building a ship. first one is gonna be like a 1kt cargo ship without ftl just for use in MOR


[22-May-23 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	i'll probably upgrade instead tho, like DrTom said :p


[22-May-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	upgrade. The small shp would be useless and the engines are a major cost factor


[22-May-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	you get 2x or more with specialized cargo bays (weight mostly, unless you do gases)


[22-May-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	yeah, that's probably what i'll do


[22-May-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-May-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	yeah :p


[22-May-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	just looking at the prices, swapping out a small cargo bay for a high-density one will cost ~0.9MNCC :')


[22-May-23 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	and that's market so realistically 1M+


[22-May-23 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127

**BlackAnthrax**:	not sure whether the incinerator will really help. You'll have to check the plant market which plants are available in abundance and you'd at least need to run a double recipe. which means either HCP+GRN or HCP+MAI ..


[25-May-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i had a full set running here for a long time - inc, farms, water extraction


[25-May-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	worked like a charm to help me avoid price spikes. Even today i still run 3 incubators and 3 farms here - importing the HCG and H20 from other bases


[25-May-23 02:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	i think actually of moving all of that off world to another place now (the 4th base)


[25-May-23 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	vallis has negative fertility. INC does make sense, but only if you import plants from somewhere else


[25-May-23 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	ah, that is not true. It makes sense if you are at the beginning and the price of C is high


[25-May-23 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	it is suoptimal, but that is life for a beginner


[25-May-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	im new and ended up here as a metallurgist. any reccomendation what to build next after being done with the initial stuff?


[25-May-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	good question. i ended up with 3 incs, 4 farms, some o extractos etc. just making iron until the base was full, THEN expanded over to verdant to make my own food and oxygen ;)


[25-May-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and feed my incinerators. fhemoved the food production to midway-c and started moving water to xg-326d - that is still where i am ;)


[25-May-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	i'm in a similar place, except i went with just producing FEO/FE and BSE on Vallis for like a year


[25-May-23 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	it's slow, but it gives you steady profits and the most used early building material after MCG


[25-May-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	you should also try to build into your HQ specialisation, which gives you bonuses to metallurgy and construction buildings


[25-May-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	this is, with all respect, a better joke - nice tot ake if you have noethign better to do with the base permit.


[25-May-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the only real gain dcomes from chamger of comercee and specialists.


[25-May-23 07:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	yeah, that's true


[25-May-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spookuragee**:	fortunately Vallis has a metallurgy campaign and you start with metallurgy experts :3


[25-May-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	generally the most advice i hear is go from metallurgy into construction, since you can make your own building parts much cheaper than buying them on the market


[25-May-23 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and sell the excess more expesively than you could sell FE

**DrTom**:	large order. yeah, can take time


[26-May-23 04:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	vallis is not a good lpace for extractors - works as supply, but you get a lot more outwards on other planets


[26-May-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	want them faster - smaller size, recurring. requires pro license


[26-May-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	for extracting buildings you usually want to fill your queue with small sized, unless you have pro then you go one recurring, or go away for a while, then you can go big batches if your factories align with it..

[02-Jun-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	4 GRN into carbon for cost


[02-Jun-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	but only 2 can be done on a HYD


[02-Jun-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jun-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zonespace**:	really slow though


[02-Jun-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jun-23 07:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	repair when condition gets below 80%


[05-Jun-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	Ah, now I see the repair button... thanks!


[05-Jun-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	actually you want to idealy time your repair for the moment before it ticks below 80% if possible.


[05-Jun-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	easier said than done though


[05-Jun-23 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	just when I thought about expanding, then come the repairs.... weeeeee


[05-Jun-23 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	you may need to keep a stock of all the repair goods on the base and not have to wait for your supply ship to arrive too late.


[05-Jun-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	same as repairing your ships too!


[05-Jun-23 07:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	thanks!


[05-Jun-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	Any thoughts on how low I can let the ship conditions get before it's egregious?


[05-Jun-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I suppose it is a question of efficiency. You still burn the same amount of fuel for the trip, but it will take longer to get there as the condition suffers.


[05-Jun-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	ok, thanks


[05-Jun-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I am not an expert on this subject. Longer term players may have a better answer for you.


[05-Jun-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	it seems simple, until I start to understand it...


[05-Jun-23 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	For Ships  you want to repair when they go below 80%


[05-Jun-23 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Partihrl**:	Why is repairing right at 80% the swweet spot, why not repair sooner or later?


[05-Jun-23 09:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	partly repair cost goes up at 80% and theres prolly an efficiency loss as well and prolly 3 other things that im not smart enough to think of


[05-Jun-23 09:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	Because for ships the only difference between repair level is speed, and if you read the info of a ship - it ways the speed is only reduced if repair is below 80%. SO, 81% of 100% are no diference for ships.

**DogeConomy**:	especially in a weight-heavy metal planet, you're going to need all the tonnage you're going to get :)


[17-Jun-23 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	weight only counts for STL flights. according to BLU weight does not really increase the fuel costs for a full ship on min burn.. on 25% burn you need to spend extra above 200t.. but no one is flying with that much burn i think


[17-Jun-23 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so the few extra ncc by weight don't really matter

**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah but that's usually not the norm.


[17-Jun-23 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	regular cargo runs run at almost minimal consumption to be as fuel efficient as possible.. or later on maybe inbetween 2 and 25% to get your delivery windows timed right

**perryf**:	I found it because of its mention in a Hacker News post and I assume that's why there's so many joining today as well.


[23-Jun-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**perryf**:	Specifically, a comment in a post about EVE.


[23-Jun-23 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	if you need any help feel free to message me


[23-Jun-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Iv discovered this game a month ago and once the intial learning curve is passed, its a great game


[23-Jun-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	if you like this sort of game


[23-Jun-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**perryf**:	Really, I got attracted by the prospect of a crazy learning curve...

[23-Jun-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	my advice is dont get bogged down by the details at first. The start is slow regardless


[23-Jun-23 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	You'll figure out the game by the time you have money to do something


[23-Jun-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Well regarding Eve, I think this game is not as complex as Eve.


[23-Jun-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Having played both, I would disagree


[23-Jun-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	The complete war aspect is missing, there is no bounty, etc. No Low Sec, Null Sec, ...


[23-Jun-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	That doesn’t make Eve more complexe. There are more things in Eve but it’s a lot of simple things


[23-Jun-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	The economy here is has alot more depth


[23-Jun-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I agree, both games have mass production but the economy here is better


[23-Jun-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	I am biased as I played Eve for the trading and production and didn’t touch most other aspects


[23-Jun-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	You haven't been to Null Sec?


[23-Jun-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**perryf**:	I mean, I would assume this game is more comparable to just the industry portion of Eve.


[23-Jun-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**perryf**:	I did WH life in EVE and didn't do that much production and trade myself (though I always wanted to), and instead more focused on stuff that just wouldn't make sense for this game. (Exploration, scanning, fights, ratting...)


[23-Jun-23 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	I was drawn to Eve for the industry part but found that it was lacking


[23-Jun-23 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	but I have to admit I didn’t explore much of the figth aspects


[23-Jun-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	what was missing?


[23-Jun-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	in the Eve industry you mean?


[23-Jun-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes


[23-Jun-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Hard to articulate, just a general lack of depth

**Harmakhis**:	Hi I'm new. If I want to buy materials to build a second extractor, can I buy those materials on the market somewhere?


[23-Jun-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	Welcome Harmakhis


[23-Jun-23 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	well, as a free user you will have to trade at a commodity exchange (cx for short)


[23-Jun-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so you need to fly a ship to the CX and buy your stuff there and fly it back to the planet.


[23-Jun-23 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	on the left hand side of the screen you can see the button CXL . this is the list of all CXes . the closest one to us is NC1 (Moria) which is in the same system


[23-Jun-23 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	I see the moria window


[23-Jun-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	on the bottom there's this line with the button "new bfr" and then the numbered windows. on new bfr you can type commands to open windows directly without going through all the clicks.. this is a more advanced use which you will learn over rime


[23-Jun-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	*Time


[23-Jun-23 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so for example if you want to buy rations you can type "cxob RAT.NC1" to see the offers and requests for rations on moria station


[23-Jun-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	I'm entering in a new window and getting "illegal command"


[23-Jun-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	I will just try and buy some construction supp;lies normally


[23-Jun-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	*slowly?


[23-Jun-23 05:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	what did you type exactly?


[23-Jun-23 05:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the other way would the be longer -> left side -> CXL -> Moria station -> select the type of item in the dropdown and get the order for the item you want to buy..


[23-Jun-23 05:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	got it the slow way


[23-Jun-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	typed "cxob rat.nc1"


[23-Jun-23 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	now I need to pick up the stuff?

**Harmakhis**:	Okay 1 of my ships is flying over


[23-Jun-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the problem with the material ticket command is that you need to type RAT.NC1 in capital letters for it to work


[23-Jun-23 05:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and without the quotes :D


[23-Jun-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	yee the capitalization fixes it I hate that


[23-Jun-23 05:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Harmakhis**:	anyway thank you


[23-Jun-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	the beginning of the game will be rather slow. use the time to familiarize with the game more. create some spreadsheets, etc.


[23-Jun-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and ask in chat if there's questions. you will be helped

**anno1919**:	So I broke out the spreadsheet... I must have done something wrong, my cost per unit of or mined is wildly under the market prices.  Is that anyone else's experience?


[26-Jun-23 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	iron ore mining ain't worth it, switch to any different industry and you'll recieve a 2-10x gain in profit


[26-Jun-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I assume you have some funds available for the purchase of new buildings


[26-Jun-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(what I am referring to is pure iron ore mining)


[26-Jun-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chtag**:	I'm no the one asking he question, but extractor only has iron listed. I guees I need to read the manual more


[26-Jun-23 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	I've actually been refining it to STL


[26-Jun-23 12:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**anno1919**:	It only shows as iron, if that's all that's there.


[26-Jun-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	my calculations leads to a cost of 26 NCC/unit of iron


[26-Jun-23 12:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	even when sold at 70 per unit, it only makes 1.5k per day per extractor


[26-Jun-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hence me saying it's not worth it


[26-Jun-23 12:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Xk37**:	nope, unless you happen to get a shipping contract that you can combine with it or something


[26-Jun-23 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	careful with those missions... they often cost a lot in fuel


[26-Jun-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chtag**:	The answer might be in the manual, but reactor usage = min is faster faster 48%. Is it because min is a "smart" usage, like lauch quick then save on fuel ?


[26-Jun-23 12:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Chtag**:	I figured out the fuel usage a bit too late :D


[26-Jun-23 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I have no idea - i don't pay close attention to that since I make fuel. I should... but I often don't bother

[26-Jun-23 03:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-23 04:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-23 04:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madox**:	I could transport it back tbh


[26-Jun-23 04:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Jun-23 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MoLab**:	I think it makes much more sense to ship O2 from Verdant to Vallis


[27-Jun-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	a bit better, but also a logistical hassle with starter ships


[27-Jun-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	wb-947e is very good as well


[27-Jun-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	i was bringing a lot in


[27-Jun-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	what is the logistical problem with that?


[27-Jun-23 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	with a 500t ship you're better off shiping from mor or doing shipping requests


[27-Jun-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Pwnce_de_Leon** left.*


[27-Jun-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	but shipping costs about 93 FTL per trip. That is worth it, you can ship about 400 - 500 O2.


[27-Jun-23 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	you know what you can also do: just bring it from cx together with your consumer goods, and invest your money into something that makes you more money than a COL


[27-Jun-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	that is what I currently do, I buy lots of O2 from cx but it is about 100 - 150 NCC so quite expensive...


[27-Jun-23 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	So I thought I follow the production chain and produce at Verdant


[27-Jun-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	fair, but what if you just build something else instead that makes you twice as much money per day, as you spend on O per day


[27-Jun-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	but fair, at the end of day, money is money


[27-Jun-23 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes at the moment I am not logistically restraint. My ships just hang around...


[27-Jun-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	things became much more easy since I started to produce products instead of ore and iron shipping...


[27-Jun-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i mean you can start a new chain :D and not continue the old one


[27-Jun-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	what do you have in mind?


[27-Jun-23 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i recently started chemistry on circe


[27-Jun-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	though i have a food chain a montem manufacturing setup and... a bbh producer here


[27-Jun-23 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes I also thought about producing FLX with chemistry on Montem


[27-Jun-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I have a vallis manufacturing...


[27-Jun-23 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	yeah maybe that should have been my choice too...


[27-Jun-23 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	i want to produce low volume and weight cargo so... i guess ill move to pp3-s


[27-Jun-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	after all i already produce steel and soon with my chem base i will make epoxy


[27-Jun-23 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	(and ddt and tcl but thats a bit ahead)


[27-Jun-23 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes I also produce STL, that is why I have demand for O2 so that I plan to expand to Verdant


[27-Jun-23 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	hmm well i have food there - i am better off buying o2 from moria for my smelters


[27-Jun-23 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	that is about 50k NCC for a load of a ship. Are you sure?


[27-Jun-23 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	idk never calculated it if its more worth to produce your wown :D


[27-Jun-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	well i ship it with flx and c in batches so... i think i dont have the most optimal setup


[27-Jun-23 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	you ship FLX from Verdant?


[27-Jun-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	nope from moria


[27-Jun-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	and c too...


[27-Jun-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	well I have done some homework with spreadsheet but to be honest I think I have not calculated all options and compared them


[27-Jun-23 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	well i dont like to overthink... just to produce xd


[27-Jun-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes I just recognized that cx prices for O2 reached 150, that triggered me in some way. Now it is back to 100.


[27-Jun-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	well profit margins decrease but now its all great


[27-Jun-23 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**V.O.J.tech**:	*when o2 was at 150


[27-Jun-23 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes I thought with 150 a load of a ship of O2 is 75k NCC so that is not bad for a COL


[27-Jun-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	however the worst idea is to put the O2 COL to vallis (prior discussion). That's definitely not worth it.

[27-Jun-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Where is that located?


[27-Jun-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Ah XH I found it.


[27-Jun-23 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	No I think I will focus on my Verdant plan.


[27-Jun-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Is there a price where you would like it? It’s kinda stuck there for now so id like to get it of my hands


[27-Jun-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	I wouldn't focus on self supply early. If you want to grow fast find cheap bases that make 70k a day and don't need much shipping.


[27-Jun-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	5 of those and you grow at insane rates


[27-Jun-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	how should a cheap base make 70k a day


[27-Jun-23 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	you can try prunplanner. look for bases that are profitable with low build costs


[27-Jun-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	RE can be very good if you can sell onsite. it's hard to do without pro though


[27-Jun-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	well simply produce O2 on Verdant makes 75k with a simple COL per shipment when prices are at 150 NCC


[27-Jun-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	unless you join a project group you will have to buy inputs. this can put huge cash burdens on you


[27-Jun-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	i wouldn't bank on O staying that high


[27-Jun-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	thats a lot of shipping as well


[27-Jun-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	nobody knows the future


[27-Jun-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	no but i do know all the base profits in the area


[27-Jun-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes it is about 200 FTL per trip back and forth and some STL


[27-Jun-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	high profits low cost get grabbed up pretty fast


[27-Jun-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I also think production of O2 will ramp up at 150 per O2


[27-Jun-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	that is maybe some reason it is back to 100


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I have a base in mind that costs about 400k and makes 14k profit / day on Verdant. What is that RE - thing / where to start it?


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	People import form other CXs


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	so


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	prices are somewhat unifrom


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	galaxty wide


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	it can depend on the item since shipping costs variable amounts per item


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Peaks will resolve quickly from


[27-Jun-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	others inporting


[27-Jun-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	yeah indeed. More often than not the price difference is pretty much shipping cost


[27-Jun-23 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	like you don’t save anything buying limestone in benten


[27-Jun-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I think that is maybe not the best strategy with the starting ships


[27-Jun-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	avoiding any supply chain is nice. one thing to note is basic can create shipping requests to CX dest


[27-Jun-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	shipping in your supply chain*


[27-Jun-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	500t are pretty useless for most RE but some areas you can get requests filled well


[27-Jun-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes but would you build a COL for O2 on vallis to avoid shipping in the supply chain? I guess not.


[27-Jun-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	no but i wouldn't build a base for O either id just buy it


[27-Jun-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MemoryAlpha**:	unless you buy FE and run a full base of SME for STL you shouldn't need a lot of O


[27-Jun-23 02:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I run two SME on STL


[27-Jun-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Iv got 4 and I still buy my O


[27-Jun-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	in the grand scheme of things regarding what i have to pay in input for my SMEs, O makes up only a very small fraction. youll be fine just importing it. the price could even double, and as long as you arent doing STL youll barely notice


[27-Jun-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jun-23 01:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**chelvaric**:	i do iron and alo smelting and have one collector for that is enoupgh for my production at the moment


[28-Jun-23 02:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@clanogrady I said "is returning", not "have returned" xP


[28-Jun-23 02:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@chelvaric you might need to revisit your calculations soon to see whether adding another smelter would be more profitable than keeping that collector running.. (you're saving 169 NCC per extractor per day after consumables and taxes, before degradation of buildings, which can be far less than the profit that can be made from smelting metals such as steel)


[28-Jun-23 02:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	When I started out, I figured that making Steel without an O source wasn't worth it. Granted C at the time was around 400, so it was better to just make another batch of FE rather than refine it.


[28-Jun-23 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	literally do anything besides FE production


[28-Jun-23 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hear hear


[28-Jun-23 02:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	it and AL currently are THE lowest paying ones


[28-Jun-23 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	dont qoute me on the AL one though


[28-Jun-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	And how does a new person source the different ores? Tio ore used to be below 200. It was fine then but now it is........


[28-Jun-23 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	guess people couldn't be bothered extracting the ore themselves :/ (or newbies want to take a shortcut into higher profit metal refining)


[28-Jun-23 02:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(fyi, TI is worse than flux recipe for aluminium @Ventches)


[28-Jun-23 02:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	yeah tio at cx price it tough


[28-Jun-23 03:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**chelvaric**:	i make more fe then i use up with my two rpefabs right now


[28-Jun-23 03:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**chelvaric**:	so i think i better add a prefab first or smelt into steel and make something else with it not sure


[28-Jun-23 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**schlorp**:	you can just do it as a ratio


[28-Jun-23 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**schlorp**:	1 order w/flx gives 4 FE which is used up in 2 STL orders


[28-Jun-23 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**chelvaric**:	hmm yeah i use flx i get 16 fe a day right now from 2 smelters


[28-Jun-23 03:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**chelvaric**:	and i use up 8 a day for bbh


[28-Jun-23 03:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**schlorp**:	you can tool around on PRUNplanner and see what ratio can get rid of your iron surplus

[28-Jun-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no sane person would set up collectors here, they only save you 200 NCC per day


[28-Jun-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	so from MOR is shipping about 3/t?


[28-Jun-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well depends on how fast you want it


[28-Jun-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	so 100/u is still too low?


[28-Jun-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just send a shipping contract my way


[28-Jun-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Ok, I am just trying to learn what is correct to do here. I did not intend any to disrespect anyone.


[28-Jun-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	shipping is roughly 5/u


[28-Jun-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(last contract I took)


[28-Jun-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	no worries, just trying to help you gage prices


[28-Jun-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	LMA MOR/21030


[28-Jun-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	LMA MOR/20526


[28-Jun-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	even though currently MOR and Vallis are fairly close to each other in their orbits?


[28-Jun-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Someone will do it eventually at any price


[28-Jun-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	its just a question of how long you will wait


[28-Jun-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	second LMA was mine


[28-Jun-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I paid 10/t for shipping


[28-Jun-23 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	agree with 10/u. That my basic rate then i adjust if need be


[28-Jun-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	ok, I understand. I was thinking someone might have been sitting on a surplus inventory on Vallis already. I guess I wasn't really taking into account the haulage cost.


[28-Jun-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I would have if my primary industry here was smelting


[28-Jun-23 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I had like 5000 rations/DW at my Verdant base


[28-Jun-23 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	300x FE, 500x LST


[28-Jun-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	So current median price at CX is 91.85 and I need to add 10/u for shipping, so I should offer 102/u. Is that right?


[28-Jun-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	no not right


[28-Jun-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(if you want it fast)


[28-Jun-23 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just post a shipping ad instead when you get the oxygen


[28-Jun-23 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	this reduces the number of factors that goes into the problem


[28-Jun-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	It seems very Vilos Cohaagen of you to want to sell me Oxygen for a profit - Lol


[28-Jun-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	since you can't be 100% sure a person that just happens to have 100x O in their moria warehouse, decides to check the Vallis LM, and then decides to ship it here (if they even have shipping space)


[28-Jun-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I think you're getting an offer right now xd @Drevil


[28-Jun-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	yeah @100ea isn't really worth it


[28-Jun-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	lol linkify


[28-Jun-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and the offer disappears


[28-Jun-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well there you have it, from the oxygen seller themselves


[28-Jun-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	I don't really sell oxygen, just my excess imports :P


[28-Jun-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	loading oxygen onto ship


[28-Jun-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	sent, ETA 2hr 45 minutes


[28-Jun-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(you really could've done a shipping contract tbh


[28-Jun-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Thx, I do appreciate it.


[28-Jun-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You're welcome :)


[28-Jun-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I was still holding out some hope that someone local had 50 spare already on Vallis. I have my own ship landing at MOR in 3.75hrs, so I could have move it then myself.


[28-Jun-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	LM needs a "Zero" days option for truely immediate needs.


[28-Jun-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	yeah...


[28-Jun-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	500m^3 free shipping moria station to Vallis


[28-Jun-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	( and 2000 tonnes)


[28-Jun-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	I do keep a buffer, but due to recent expansion I need to keep all of it until I build up to at least 7 days again


[28-Jun-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	post LM ads or CONTDs


[28-Jun-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	The slider bar on LM ads needs to go to "zero" not just 1.


[28-Jun-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	problem is you'd need an auto-provision or similar locking system for that


[28-Jun-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then isn't that a CX order


[28-Jun-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then it'd be the same as having CX's on planets


[28-Jun-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	technically no, it is a request for immediate sale.


[28-Jun-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	basically though yeah


[28-Jun-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	just without a detailed browser and such


[28-Jun-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Well, I still think 1 day min is too long a wait sometimes.


[28-Jun-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	At that point you need to do a deal with someone directly


[28-Jun-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	and not through the LM


[28-Jun-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	only compromise would be to post the LM ads ahead of time


[28-Jun-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	maybe in bulk, but wouldn't cover all the scenarios


[28-Jun-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(e.g forgetting a certain item in your ship_


[28-Jun-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	my Verdant base basically runs off shipping orders now xd


[28-Jun-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	I do have 1 open and 1 otw shipping contracts now to move my O from Verd > Vallis


[28-Jun-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	haven't sent a ship back there in a month


[28-Jun-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Shipping orders are the best, my trading empire runs on shipping contracts


[28-Jun-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	5 more minutes for FREE shipping from Moria CX to Vallis, last call


[28-Jun-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Does that include more for me too?


[28-Jun-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep


[28-Jun-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	right now it's looking like 1500tt/ 400m^3


[28-Jun-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jun-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	alright, heading off for real this time


[28-Jun-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Drevil**:	Lol, that works out to less than 100/u after all.


[28-Jun-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Jun-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Jul-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	supply ran dry


[01-Jul-23 02:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	plus it wasn't worth selling ore at the regular price of 50/unit


[01-Jul-23 04:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	you should always look at the price chart, 70 its it common price


[01-Jul-23 04:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well the chart was made hard to read by that one guy that bought the FEO at 1000 NCC a piece


[01-Jul-23 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ventches**:	look at the 7 day chart then....


[01-Jul-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	I've set up a "ship repair workshop" locally on Vallis - you can send me contracts to buy Basic/Lightweight Hull plates so you don't need to move them around on your ships, saving cargo space :)


[10-Jul-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madox**:	I have a question. If my ship gets damaged enough will I have to replace some more advanced parts like bridges, engines etc?


[10-Jul-23 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madox**:	Also @DogeConomy when do you repair your ships ?

**--SCHAITR--**:	Ans 1: no.


[10-Jul-23 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Ans 2: ships start slowing down substantially after 80%, so you'd ideally repair before that


[10-Jul-23 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	oh yeah I was gonna ask, it seems like in APEX there's no way to change multiple BFRs at once? like I have a trading screen that shows a chart and order book, and as far as I can tell I have to edit them one-by-one (or make a new screen) if I want to change what commodity the screen is displaying


[12-Jul-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	vs somewhere I can change the commodity for everything onscreen in one go


[12-Jul-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-23 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Jul-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

**dakota1234**:	so this doesn't... really have an actual answer, but how do y'all think about building out vs up? I'm considering expanding to a second base to help me get some basic materials, but kinda torn between "just buy bulk materials and process them" vs "have bases that can get you most of your materials consistently"


[18-Jul-23 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	which, I mean, both are fine options but I'm curious how the more experienced folks think about it


[18-Jul-23 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Entirely by play style, I prefer to gather the resources myself to process but I really only specify for the products that I'm into.


[18-Jul-23 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	I don't produce any upkeep materials even though that would be cheaper for the high end things.


[18-Jul-23 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I source O2 from verdant for a STL production at Vallis. Of cause I could purchase O2 but I prefer to produce it by myself.


[18-Jul-23 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jul-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jul-23 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	going rate (what I pay) is 10 NCC per Ton or per m3 whichever is the greater of the two variables


[18-Jul-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	If I want something urgent then I up it to 100 NCC per weight/volume


[18-Jul-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	most couriers take one or two big paying contracts to ship, then the fill up their spare capacity with the smaller lower paying contacts to maximise the income on their trip

**MrfkngToxic**:	i got a note saying my ore purchase happened. the listing is no longer in the cx, but the ore is no where to be found. not on a ship not in my warehouse. any ideas


[21-Jul-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MrfkngToxic**:	financials page shows the order completed as well, 150k worth of ore


[21-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@MrfknToxic have you had a look in CXOS?


[21-Jul-23 06:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	there you can see all your trades and who bought from you


[21-Jul-23 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	^^


[21-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Check your CONTD


[21-Jul-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	150k worth of ore sounds like something that might overflow your warehouse


[21-Jul-23 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah that is a very good catch.. if you don't have enough space in your WAR, you get a contract that tells you to pick your shit up


[21-Jul-23 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Sorry, check CONT, not CONTD


[21-Jul-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	should also be visible in the sidebar


[21-Jul-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that too, I usually keep my sidebar pinned at all times since it's so useful *unfortunately it takes up a chunk of screen real estate*


[21-Jul-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i think the sidebar is actually really useful. since the CONT screen can't be filtered


[21-Jul-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and with PMMG extended you even see your contract partners directly in the sidebar

**Alblaka**:	Nah, it's just a matter of the game being still in developement, having a REALLY slow developement, and there being no end goal. At some point you have virtually infinite money, and there's nothing keeping you interested in the game, so lategame players might just quit or go on vacation... which in turn can have pretty notable impact on the markets, if they were the main supplier of a particular good.

I already have a dialogue with Karethian about a transfer so, if elected, I believe it will be a smooth transition.  I am active and enthusiastic about PRUN.  I’m happy to chat either in this channel or in DMs about any questions that anyone has.  Thanks everyone!

But they spoke up in chat and offered to take over (previous gov left), so that already beats *some other governeurs* I've seen that just wordlessly went for the election and then kinda did nothing alltogether.

[06-Aug-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Newish player here, I have seen a few people say that, how does that work? Are you just renting the rest of your space out?


[06-Aug-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sentry**:	essentially yeah, they can make transport contracts for other players to accept. as the shipper you just have to make sure you have enough space for the content in the contract before accepting the contract. but they can work out the details and tailor the contract to fit the remainder of the ships cargo


[06-Aug-23 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**sentry**:	hope that makes sense, im still waking up lol


[06-Aug-23 12:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(you also have to have a pro account to do contracts)


[06-Aug-23 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Make sense, good idea, I have done quite a few trips to Moria Station for way too little cargo. Used a lot of fuel early, but hey it's learning pains.


[06-Aug-23 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I have a ship sitting there with 450T of space and only reason I have not brought it back to Vallis is because it just seems like a waste.

**Guzzette**:	Ravick: Your sell orders for Carbon and Oxygen have expired


[10-Aug-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I think that just means someone already bought them.

**DogeConomy**:	no


[10-Aug-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	@Guzzette @Moona was right


[10-Aug-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	half of them have now dissapeared, maybe the server is just laggy


[10-Aug-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	sometimes the apex LM buffer glitches out


[10-Aug-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Guzzette**:	don't waste it :)


[10-Aug-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	<3


[10-Aug-23 07:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	So i went the direction of have 4 extractors and 1 smelter. what would be a good direction?


[10-Aug-23 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I thought about being able to produce my own carbon or maybe producing Oxygen and making steel instead.


[10-Aug-23 07:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	But need to start looking into the future more than just making more extractors.


[10-Aug-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	oxygen and carbon production on Vallis is too slow to be viable


[10-Aug-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	That is good information ty.


[10-Aug-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	What about Hydroponics?


[10-Aug-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Is H2O slow?


[10-Aug-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can do that anywhere if you import water from the CX


[10-Aug-23 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I started off making  Bfabs, then Lfabs and now Rfabs


[10-Aug-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Would it be worth starting a new base on another planet just for 1 rss, or would making something with my own metal be a more appropriate thing?


[10-Aug-23 07:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I'm always down for suggestions and learning more about this game.


[10-Aug-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	whats an RSS?


[10-Aug-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	resources


[10-Aug-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	"Really Simple Syndication"?


[10-Aug-23 07:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh


[10-Aug-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	dont try to make FE and then ship to CX for Sale to bulky, seel the FE you make localy to someone like me


[10-Aug-23 07:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Resources


[10-Aug-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it depends


[10-Aug-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Is it better to make FE or Steel? I guess which do people need more here.


[10-Aug-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I used to do the full prosess FEO-FE-STL, but now its easier for me to just buy FE and use my smelters for AL and SI, I still make the occasional bit of STL from the FE I buy


[10-Aug-23 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	one of the first things I did at the start was make a Welding plant and sell Truss and i used to make and sell a lot of OVR just simple products that would seel on the local market so didnt need shipping


[10-Aug-23 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Just trying to figure out my end goal and how to get there.


[10-Aug-23 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I could keep doing what I am doing but then progress will kind of stall.


[10-Aug-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	Ive been playing for almost 300 days and only built my first ship this week, dont worry about long term goals just do what you can to be cash flow positive now, and as you start to expand to more planets then you'll figure out a goal


[10-Aug-23 07:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I am positive so at least doing something right.


[10-Aug-23 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I have been making ship kits for a month now (cargo bays and fuel tanks) and for the last three days been working ont he spreadsheet to start making Engines (just standart STL enginges)


[10-Aug-23 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	At what point is it a good idea to go to another planet?


[10-Aug-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	it costs a shitload to setup a ne planet use the PRUNNER Tool to work out the costing :) then you'll be happy sitting on vallis a bit longer


[10-Aug-23 07:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	let me check the age of my second planet.....


[10-Aug-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I started playing 294 days ago, my second planet is 219 days old so... 75 days just over two months to setup second planet from when I started


[10-Aug-23 07:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	my third planet was only three days after that, so once I had a plan I started to expand faster.


[10-Aug-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	lol


[10-Aug-23 07:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I could not get the Prunner to work, the link didn't work for me when someone posted it.


[10-Aug-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	I was also about 70 days for my 2nd base, and 100 days after that for my 3rd - but then my 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th were like in a month of each other


[10-Aug-23 07:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	But I also know there have been people who got loans and made plans and established a half dozen bases within their first month


[10-Aug-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	so it kinda depends on how you play


[10-Aug-23 07:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	Prunner is very useful once you get to know how to work it, from memory it was just a zip file that you open into a folder then run the application file


[10-Aug-23 07:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	its a bit fiddly to get it to choose the planet you want, its best to put in the resource type, temperature, pressure, gravity as many search vaeriables that match the planet you want to put a base on


[10-Aug-23 08:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Since I have 4 extractors I might go for a second smelther now.


[10-Aug-23 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	ok, I  will buy all the FE you produce, just contract to me whenever you have some and I will pay the CX sell price (i.e. the higher of the two prices on the CX)


[10-Aug-23 08:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

Lunacy XD I mean, I'm partially responsible because I've been voting RezExt ever since I came here to produce local Carbon, but that was more meant as a joke / indicator for gov.

[12-Aug-23 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	most people on vallis do smelting hence 21 people are voting for metalurgy.


[12-Aug-23 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	On the subject of metallurgy, don't suppose anybody needs a large volume of refined iron, I seem to have overproduced and my pro licensed lapsed. My ships are run ragged moving between here and a construction planet. Honestly could sell a few hundred at a middling price at this point.


[12-Aug-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Could probably serve 300 of them at between 475-500 or vaguely in that range. Would save me the trouble of shipping with the two ships the basic license allows me.


[12-Aug-23 08:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'll take 100 at 475 if you're okay with that.


[12-Aug-23 10:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Guzzette**:	Magnus I will


[12-Aug-23 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	take all the iron (FE) you don’t want, just contract to me at the price you said. And when we you have more I will take thA too

[13-Aug-23 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'll try to catch the buy contracts but they seem to get scooped up fast


[13-Aug-23 06:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	On the subject of 'construction planet' it means a planet that runs an advertising campaign for construction, versus 'metallurgy'.. Gives people producing construction goods there a significant improvement in their cycle time.


[13-Aug-23 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	In my own case I ship iron refined here to a planet several jumps over


[13-Aug-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	The problem is that the round trip is a full day and 4 hours, or 23 hours if I run the engines at max.


[13-Aug-23 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	sent FE contract :D


[13-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	why are you going over to gibson for construction?


[13-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Danakil is closer


[13-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I started the game there (unwisely?) and I'm reluctant to let go of my first base's development


[13-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'd have to retrain experts.


[13-Aug-23 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ah same with me as well


[13-Aug-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I started at verdant


[13-Aug-23 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but you can afford a new base now (at least a Core Module) with the iron you just sold me, so that's a plus :D


[13-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	With all the money I've made I've dumped it into my ships.


[13-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I have one of those


[13-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	seemed a sensible investment


[13-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	one trip instead of six


[13-Aug-23 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well more bases would bring more cash faster, making the WCB upgrade faster as well xd


[13-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah WCBs are a lifesaver


[13-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	yes but I can only have so many in motion with a basic license


[13-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I forget if the maximum is two in motion, or three on basic


[13-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can utilise a few strategies to optimise shipping


[13-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	2 on basic


[13-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Yeah I own two and they don't ever stop moving


[13-Aug-23 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	1) use shipping contracts


[13-Aug-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	2) refine the high weight goods down to low weight goods


[13-Aug-23 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	3) conduct research into profitable export-light industries


[13-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	If I made my planet bases less specialized I could do that, but on Vallis I'm specialized into metallurgy on Gibson I'm full stacked into construction to max the bonus there


[13-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's how I survived my two and a half months on basic


[13-Aug-23 06:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Right now I just needed someone to accept overflow to keep my warehouse clear


[13-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Twenty Smelters are probably overkill.. but... ehh


[13-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	all good, if you overproduce, I'd be happy to buy from you


[13-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	20 smelters aren't overkill at all


[13-Aug-23 06:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I need 4500+ units of AL per week


[13-Aug-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you can produce at that scale, I'd be surprised :D


[13-Aug-23 06:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	40 iron in 4 days 8 hours.. *digs up calculator*


[13-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	4500 units of aluminium, not iron


[13-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(in terms of time taken)


[13-Aug-23 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	yes I'm just looking at my own, I make 184 iron a day at my current percentages.


[13-Aug-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	If the advertising campaign for metallurgy switches on that likely will change


[13-Aug-23 06:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Aug-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I've attempted at securing aluminium suppliers in the past but I've had no luck


[13-Aug-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MagnusFaustus**:	I used to refine titanium but the price spiked when I tried to buy at scale and I went hands-off for something more stable.


[13-Aug-23 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	FE.NC1 prices have risen so it must be nice :)


[13-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	It's nowhere near where it used to be back over.. they used to pay me 750 CIS for a while when I was starting


[13-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I gave up 'most' of my own extraction


[13-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	wait they were *that* high before?


[13-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	A long time ago


[13-Aug-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Fall, two years ago?


[13-Aug-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	construction must've been an awful industry to start off with back then


[13-Aug-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the current universe is 901 days old


[13-Aug-23 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I started in Metallurgy and that's how I ended up on Gibson, the oxygen/iron ore composition.


[13-Aug-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so it must be during the first year of operation on this universe


[13-Aug-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	probably! I just know some people seemed very widely set up and they kept asking me for more iron when I was still nublet.


[13-Aug-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Now I turn all my iron into Basic Bulkheads and ship that back into Moria station


[13-Aug-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Even if the scalpers are buying it up it's still profitable for me


[13-Aug-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	BBH.NC1


[13-Aug-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah prices have stabilised


[13-Aug-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	The price got locked because I think someone noticed that I kept selling at the scalper, the Lumber Liquidator there


[13-Aug-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	oh @lowstrife


[13-Aug-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	And they just ramp the price into their 'high' price whenever my shipments come in


[13-Aug-23 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	they have the third highest HQ level out of all the players in the entire game xd


[13-Aug-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's a lot of margin you must've lost out on


[13-Aug-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Good for t hem I guess.. Having all that money allows them to speculate.


[13-Aug-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Yes it's a lot of margin but it's a lot less 'thinking', I try not to invest a huge amount of thought on this game when I can avoid it.


[13-Aug-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah good idea


[13-Aug-23 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	You must have a significant cash reserve on hand, have you considered expanding into other planets?


[13-Aug-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I find something that works and if it stops, I'll just disassemble parts of my base.


[13-Aug-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same when LHP.NC1 prices got crashed by me


[13-Aug-23 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I had to shift vallis away from hull plate manufacturing to glass making


[13-Aug-23 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	It's probably no wonder why all the big corporations have large multi-bases with self-contained economies. Hard to guarantee the availability of resources in the public market.


[13-Aug-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah


[13-Aug-23 06:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	As for what I'm doing these days it's trying to improve my ships so they don't get damaged so heavily by re-entering 'unusual' atmospheres, or through flying through weird environments. Really keen on cutting back my maintenance costs.


[13-Aug-23 06:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	So if someone asks me why I have a liquid float of 3 million NCC, it's because I'm watching the shipbuilding orders like a hawk for stability control systems and other shielding units.

***DogeConomy** deleted this message.*


[13-Aug-23 06:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'm looking into expanding into shipbuilding (more advanced) so if you could tell me the full order list, I'll let you know when the parts you need are ready for production.


[13-Aug-23 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'm going to need an STS.NC1 and probably two of them and some advanced g-seating.


[13-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so 2x STS and 2x AGS?


[13-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	1 AGS actually


[13-Aug-23 06:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I managed to scrape one over in Benten back about 6 months ago


[13-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there's another one at Moria right now


[13-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you don't mind paying 320k


[13-Aug-23 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Benten you mean?  For the AGS?

**DogeConomy**:	nevermind


[13-Aug-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I'd invest in the better engines too, but not sure where the cut-over for efficiency is


[13-Aug-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Every single reactor or engine, save for the fuel saving seems to have some downsides involved


[13-Aug-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	HPRs have been buffed in the recent update


[13-Aug-23 06:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or LFEs I can't remember which one


[13-Aug-23 06:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll double check


[13-Aug-23 06:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Maybe I should invest in larger fuel tanks I might be having a problem with being hamstrung


[13-Aug-23 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Yep, seems like if I run these higher end engines with more fuel rather than less they definitely get speed advantages.. The high power would reach Gibson in 8 hours if I ran it with a full utilization


[13-Aug-23 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Although I guess at a speed like that I should probably up-armor the ship too to protect it from meteorites.


[13-Aug-23 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Eeeeehhh.. choices... Too much thought I'm going to take this train of thought offline so I can think on it with the assistance of a drink, or twelve.

[14-Aug-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	we should really bug the devs to create a contract type to *offer* shipping


[14-Aug-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	Even better would be shipping contracts with more than one kind of good 🙃


[14-Aug-23 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	VERY true


[14-Aug-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the dream of just "yes I would like to contract for 250/100" and then you fill that with whatever you want and off it goes


[14-Aug-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	sigh


[14-Aug-23 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	it's nice to want things


[14-Aug-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Not only offer shipping, but also what price you want for it - I have driven myself crazy figuring out what is a good price and finally gave up.


[14-Aug-23 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have a base or two that I would happily pay someone to drop stuff off, because they have empty queues (even here) but getting shipping is too much a pain in the ass


[14-Aug-23 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Just noticed the C and the O for sale - I will buy some just to simplify my shipping


[14-Aug-23 11:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Don't need the FEO, but if anyone wants to drop ALO on this rock I will buy it if you offer a decent price.

[14-Aug-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Moona how much space free do you have for Vallis -> Moria CX?


[14-Aug-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Not currently going there but if you need a tripp I can.


[14-Aug-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I'll take the entire amount of space you have free


[14-Aug-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I can always buy things from CE so never really a wasted trip.


[14-Aug-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I can do it the trip there, but if I buy a few things will probably only be 480T coming back.


[14-Aug-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Just need a few daily consumables.


[14-Aug-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	makes sense


[14-Aug-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Also now at 4 extractors and 5 smelters.


[14-Aug-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(I export more than I import so it won't have an impact on my logistics)


[14-Aug-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Makes sense.


[14-Aug-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so can I hire the full 500t cargo hold?


[14-Aug-23 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Ya, I'll do it.


[14-Aug-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Great, thanks :)


[14-Aug-23 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Need to find out what to do, do I make a base on Montem for LST and go for prefabs here or do chemistry over there


[14-Aug-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	So many possibilities not sure where to peel off to after the starting stuff.


[14-Aug-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	prefabs are a nice start


[14-Aug-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it'll increase self sufficiency and lessen your reliance on the open markets


[14-Aug-23 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Would you suggest just buying the LST or making my own supply?


[14-Aug-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there's plenty of limestone extractors running at montem so things are cheap


[14-Aug-23 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	ask around and you'll find tons of suppliers


[14-Aug-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I recommend starting off construction on the PP2 (ignore the PP1 as it has low profit margin caused by the bfab MMs)


[14-Aug-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	But with PP2 I would need to use AL instead of FE.


[14-Aug-23 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so expand to an aluminium planet :)


[14-Aug-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	iron is heavy and strains your logistics


[14-Aug-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Ya, starting to realize that.


[14-Aug-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it might not seem like it for now, but it soon will be


[14-Aug-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I have A LOT of ore, and smelting takes too long.


[14-Aug-23 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same, I'm sending ore right now xd


[14-Aug-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the process for aluminium production is similar to iron, which means you can fit more profit onto a ship since they're lighter


[14-Aug-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	The ore is really cheap so not really worth sending to CE just for like 5k NCC.


[14-Aug-23 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I have smelters running on a different planet and my ships are tied so I use the CX as an interchange to free up my ships


[14-Aug-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Where you at world wise? It is 1800 for me so will probably make it a 15h ish trip.


[14-Aug-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	So in the morning for me it will be done.


[14-Aug-23 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	6 minutes till 8 (AM)


[14-Aug-23 06:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	If you need extra space before you have a STO built then you can always rent a warehouse as a temporary solution


[16-Aug-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Ya, I have a few rented.


[16-Aug-23 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	FEO is pretty heavy.


[16-Aug-23 05:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	moona how soon before you will be making AL that I can buy. I can contract you some ALO to get you started if you need


[16-Aug-23 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	If you contract it I can start tomorrow, but otherwise not until I expand to an ALO planet.


[16-Aug-23 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I will sen you contracts for all materials required in 12-ish hours, I'll spreadsheet out the costing so you make a profit on each AL  that you sell back to me


[16-Aug-23 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	ok

**Ravick**:	More O and C up on LM as well


[17-Aug-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Is it helpful having the O and C available on the Vallis LM at fairly regular intervals?  If there were more of it, would it be more helpful?  It is typically around CX prices so the value is in the convenience.  Thoughts?


[17-Aug-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i mean, if i can free up logistical capacity, i'm in for it, if it's not too expensive getting it shipped to my door

[17-Aug-23 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Actually, its the availability of O/C that would allow me to do that faster than I thought - I am working on upgrading my second freightor and I thought I would need to wait for that to happen


[17-Aug-23 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

**MrfkngToxic**:	on a single bonus


[18-Aug-23 07:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	depends on the amount of buildings you have running


[18-Aug-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you're running a single building, it'll take 276.50 days from the time you got your 3rd expert


[18-Aug-23 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	divide that by the amount of buildings you've got in a particular industry to find out your estimated time

[19-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Mostly this is for the AL to fuel PP2 on Danakil, and LI for your RAD and my ship production.


[19-Aug-23 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nice


[19-Aug-23 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Although suppling it is a pain, but I am managing that part, my ship here is only 250t in capacity


[19-Aug-23 06:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	But the ASM is churning away on parts for a WCB - so that will be good.


[19-Aug-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	is a MCB a 1000/1000 cargo bay?

[19-Aug-23 06:44 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Madox**:	@DogeConomy @CraftsmanThirteen could you guys explain to me the ship-building/maitaining economy? I've run some numbers and it seems that almost every ship-related recipe is running at the loss if you would buy all mats at ask price and sold outputs at bid price (I like to consider the worst case scenario). Are you guys selling at premium or you get your inputs cheaper?


[19-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	everyone in the ship building industry gets their raw materials themselves (or through off market deals)


[19-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	LIO.NC1 and LI.NC1 are overpriced for example


[19-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	The inability to delete stuff / items is a feature of the game.  Unfortunately, you can't just jettison stuff into space or dump it in the trash.  You have to sell it to someone (ad, contract, CX).  There are marker makers for some items on the CX but not all items.

[27-Aug-23 03:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmmm how's LYR

**BlackAnthrax**:	ah, we're getting there.


[27-Aug-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	2 people already have electronics bases. And I built my AU base yesterday. I just need to wait for the POPR to get settlers ._.


[27-Aug-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Nice, sponsored by YIC ;)


[27-Aug-23 03:40 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	my AU base is there LOL


[27-Aug-23 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah @HuntianaJones also has a base there


[27-Aug-23 03:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	but the reserve pool is too small. 14% SET are unemployed, so i thought that might just work. but I only got 30 SET and i need 200 for my initial base


[27-Aug-23 03:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	there's no way to change the default 10%, I checked (even with a governor)


[27-Aug-23 03:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i will just have to wait 5 days to the next POPR


[27-Aug-23 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hopefully they'll migrate in quickly due to 100% fulfillment on POPI needs


[27-Aug-23 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	yeah, i think the majority of the planet will be FS for me


[27-Aug-23 03:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i also have 1 EDM running there, since i have so much CU that i don't want to ship, so i just turn it into SCN


[27-Aug-23 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Nice, our corps really should form an alliance together, since we're on the same page :)


[27-Aug-23 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	it's gonna be a very imbalanced alliance with 4 members vs 20ish


[27-Aug-23 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	don't worry our shipbuilding division is basically a 3/4 member team :D


[27-Aug-23 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	hmm okay


[27-Aug-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	Well, SSC.NC1 would be a no-brainer now with the current pricing strategy :)


[27-Aug-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 10:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Aug-23 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	I build my FS when I need more MFK/SFK then I deconstruct the FS, a couple of months later when I need more I rebuild the FS again


[27-Aug-23 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Aug-23 01:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Vallis has very low water content, it's better to buy H2O if you need it here.


[30-Aug-23 02:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Later on you can build bases on places like Verdant that have great H2O concentrations


[30-Aug-23 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Otherwise, you can improve it with luxury consumables (if you don't have the already) and over time you'll gain RE experts to speed it up

[30-Aug-23 02:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DonutKitty**:	or make anything lol


[30-Aug-23 02:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	No worries, I'd suggest maybe switching to an EXT to produce FEO - far better rate and you could then choose to smelt it into FE if you go that route

**DonutKitty**:	Ok, thank you so much for the help. one last thing sorry, how do you buy materials?


[30-Aug-23 02:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Generally on the local CX (unless you go PRO or BASIC), type 'CX NC1' in a new buffer to bring it up


[30-Aug-23 02:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Find the material you need, open Orders and Trade and you're good to buy it outright or place a bid


[30-Aug-23 02:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DonutKitty**:	how long do trades usually take to go through?


[30-Aug-23 02:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madox**:	depends on the good, system that you are trading in etc.


[30-Aug-23 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madox**:	The most traded goods are going in about ~12h if I place a bid, at least from my experience


[30-Aug-23 02:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Madox**:	Also it depends how outrageous you offer is :)

[30-Aug-23 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	do you have enough worker consumables at your base?


[30-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(unload both your ships on the "FLT" buffer)


[30-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Oh


[30-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	click the cargo bar


[30-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it'll open up an inventory


[30-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can drag and drop items across different inventories to move stuff


[30-Aug-23 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Great. Can't wait to support and fund the New Galactic Empire


[30-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	yup, but it would be more like taxes and permissions - I guess


[30-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I brought it down to a record low of 0.01 NCC per unit (used for repairing ships)


[30-Aug-23 07:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**OneTry**:	not like missiles, lasers and phew phew

[30-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	BSE.NC1 BBH.NC1 BTA.NC1 BDE.NC1 and MCG.NC1 are the foundational construction materials in the game

[30-Aug-23 07:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Paladin.**:	aaaaa


[30-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you can also upgrade your headquarters "HQ" to earn more base permits/get a higher production bonus for some industries


[30-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	base permits allow you to settle on other planets/expand your existing base's area


[30-Aug-23 07:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Interesting game. I would call it Space Stonks Simulator


[30-Aug-23 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 07:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	What if I try to be self sufficient, for example instead of buying food or water, I build collectors and farms? Even tho my main work focus is Metal


[30-Aug-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that can work as well, anything is possible


[30-Aug-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	though it's best to do it on a planet more suited towards farming/food production


[30-Aug-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	i.e Verdant (YI-715b)


[30-Aug-23 07:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	open "PLI YI-715b" in a new buffer


[30-Aug-23 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	When checking for a planet temperature and pressure are also important right?


[30-Aug-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DawoodSta**:	I can somehow edit my order?


[30-Aug-23 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DogeConomy**:	to get your money back


[30-Aug-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@Paladin yes temperature and pressure are also important


[30-Aug-23 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	it's much more costly to settle on a planet with suboptimal gravity/temperature/pressure


[30-Aug-23 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Thank you sir


[30-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	some materials required to build on these planets:


[30-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	low temp: INS.NC1


[30-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	high temp: TSH.NC1


[30-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	low grav: MGC.NC1


[30-Aug-23 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Is there a way to put a filter for fertile planets?


[30-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I have something in mind


[30-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Also how can I get more permits? and what's the limit?


[30-Aug-23 08:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	5 permits for free players = 5x 500 area bases


[30-Aug-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yep, luckily some older players put in the dedication to make their own websites for this game


[30-Aug-23 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch?Fertile=true&Rocky=true


[30-Aug-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	So for free players maximum 5


[30-Aug-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	If not free what's the maximum?


[30-Aug-23 08:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Thanks for the link :D


[30-Aug-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(keep in mind we're in the moria region so look for planets with low amount of jumps i.e the number of star systems you have to travel on the moria column)


[30-Aug-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Yes sir


[30-Aug-23 08:15 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	Welcome to Vallis - all you new players


[30-Aug-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Can I make money out of this game to buy myself pro if I try hard enough?


[30-Aug-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well you can't


[30-Aug-23 08:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	but a nice player might give you a free month of pro with one of their buddy codes


[30-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	you need to use that wisely


[30-Aug-23 08:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	as they don't stack (You can only use one of them for the entirety of your account's existence)


[30-Aug-23 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	So if you do come across one I recommend saving it till you have 5-10 mil in the bank (just a rough estimate)


[30-Aug-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I ran out of pro codes myself so unfortunately I can't give them out anymore


[30-Aug-23 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	Pro isn't that expensive


[30-Aug-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@DawoodSta yes Ideally every 60 or 90 days


[30-Aug-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	repair costs are rounded up, so don't worry about repairing the buildings every single day to keep them at 100%, it's infeasible


[30-Aug-23 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(i.e you'd burn all the money in your bank doing that)


[30-Aug-23 08:24 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 08:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TCW**:	guess I can't go toooo wrong there


[30-Aug-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Nothing wrong but FE is not the best return on investment.  Switching to AL smelting makes a lot more money at the moment

***HerrKaiserrr** joined.*


[30-Aug-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I would say that as long as you get a nice start up going you can save up some money to expand a bit, if FE ever becomes not that profitable you can make a PP1 and use the FE to make Bfabs.


[30-Aug-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Then before you make a second base you can always click construct and then click all the buildings and just see what they make and what those products can make, to kind of learn and see what you might want to do.

[30-Aug-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I was thinking, I think the best industry is space shipyard and ship construction


[30-Aug-23 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	This can also fuel wars


[30-Aug-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Do raw resources from planets go depleted?


[30-Aug-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	nope


[30-Aug-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	the game needs to clarify that more


[30-Aug-23 05:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I thought the same when I was starting out


[30-Aug-23 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Perfect. Let's destroy the ecology of the planets and start to pollute them and extract as many things as possible


[30-Aug-23 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Industrialist Mindset xD


[30-Aug-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I would be cool if they had universe event or something.


[30-Aug-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Since this is more of an economic game it can be funding materials for wars versus the different factions that have in the back end depending what and how much was donated from players.


[30-Aug-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Sure. I'll help fund wars


[30-Aug-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Paladin.**:	Especially for Metalurgists


[30-Aug-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-23 07:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	With PRO you can auto unload on arrival but you can’t time this unload and if there if insufficient inventory space the unload completely fails


[31-Aug-23 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Interesting

[31-Aug-23 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Is there a way to see what things are in demand and require someone to handle their supplies? For example I'm a metalugrist, is there a way to see if someone needs FE (Iron) for example? Like a way to see there is a demand?


[31-Aug-23 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You could check the commodity leader boards, but that could be a lot of work.  However you need to be PRO to sell directly to players.  If you are PRO then you could probably find demand here on the chat and sell locally


[31-Aug-23 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	What about only in the market? Is there a way?


[31-Aug-23 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Paladin.**:	Is there a way to get loans from players without having PRO?


[31-Aug-23 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	Buy 1 month of PRO and let it expire. You will then be a BASIC account.


[31-Aug-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	Think of the FREE account like it is a trial or demo. ! month of PRO unlocks full features and when you let it lapse you retain most of those features. For example yo cannot post Local Market ads, but you can accept them


[31-Aug-23 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	This is sad for me. Because I'm broke and I cannot even afford a 1 month PRO hahaha


[31-Aug-23 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	How longer can I go for free?


[31-Aug-23 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	long*


[31-Aug-23 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	You can go free forever


[31-Aug-23 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	You are just limited to using the CX and 2 ships and I think 5 or 6 bses


[31-Aug-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	tbh it's a loooong time before you start bumping up on the limitations of free


[31-Aug-23 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	missing out on shipping contracts is the only thing at the beginning I think


[31-Aug-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	What's the fastest ship with a fair amount of cargo capacity?


[31-Aug-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Not really an easily answerable question, ships are designed for cargo space rather than speed.  A ship with a lvl 2 drive will be faster than a lvl 1 but can have the same cargo spce


[31-Aug-23 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Awesome, so the drive level makes it faster


[31-Aug-23 11:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	based on purchases a usual freighter is a WCB with a Quick FLT drive and a Fuel saving SLT drive, however if you don’t mind burning fuel a standard SLT and FLT will be quicker


[31-Aug-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Interesting


[31-Aug-23 11:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Thank you


[31-Aug-23 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	lvl 2 drives are about 3m each, lvl 1 on CX is 1m but can be purchased cheaper if your Corp has the ability to build themselves


[31-Aug-23 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	So there is a demand for space ship components

[31-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	https://prunplanner.org is your friend here


[31-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	then I could buy limestone and make the next fabs I need myself


[31-Aug-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	or set up a spreadsheet


[31-Aug-23 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	22.5d payback vs 7.36d lol


[31-Aug-23 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	It's just supply and demand.


[31-Aug-23 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	More people are producing FE opposed to AL


[31-Aug-23 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Well yea, FE is the first resource you can produce as a Metallurgist, and on Vallis it's the primary company type


[31-Aug-23 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	But in order to smelt AL you need to either buy it and move it here or expand to an ALO planet which costs a lot as a new player.


[31-Aug-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	dumping all my cash in buying ALO


[31-Aug-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	im making bold moves here


[31-Aug-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	So you might just want to expand to produce more so your earnings increase and then buy ALO


[31-Aug-23 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ROI on the smelting of iron is terrible


[31-Aug-23 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Idk about yall but I'm trying to go straight for tungsten, then I'll move to titanium


[31-Aug-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	If you go from mining your own FE I think you make more than having to buy and ship your ALO.


[31-Aug-23 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	FEO*


[31-Aug-23 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	as it stands right now, daily profit would be 1.23k


[31-Aug-23 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	if I buy ALO, FLX, O and C, and start cooking that it goes right up to 4,3k


[31-Aug-23 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	If you bought everything for 3 sets of AL and sell them you profit 1,488 and that takes me 27h to do.


[31-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ah fek


[31-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	fuel costs more then I anticipated


[31-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	8k for the fuel to fly to the store and back


[31-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	fuuu


[31-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	2,103*


[31-Aug-23 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	This is not including shipping.


[31-Aug-23 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	3,939 for FE with mining your own FEO.


[31-Aug-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	how does that work?


[31-Aug-23 02:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	1 extractor, 1 smelter


[31-Aug-23 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	You can start 3 sets and you get them all after they are done, I did 27h worth but that is with my speed not yours.


[31-Aug-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Another idea is make FE at your own pace till you can make a PP1 plants and you can turn that FE into Bfabs that sell for more.


[31-Aug-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	yeah


[31-Aug-23 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Raw materials go down when supply goes up, but some of the things that can be made with it are always in demand.


[31-Aug-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Also don't stress about flex, I still don't use it but now I'm in a spot where I can so I probably will start.


[31-Aug-23 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	I just started like 2 days ago, but I will probably be able to start BTS collecting in a day or two


[31-Aug-23 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Im just guessing


[31-Aug-23 02:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**BeBopLula**:	if you are spend 8000 on fuel you are flying too fast, start the game at min fuel burn or one click above min.  You only fly at more fuel burn when you are making alot more profit


[31-Aug-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	From the TO system


[31-Aug-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	And yea 8k on fuel is nuts


[31-Aug-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	yeah, I put it right down, but still ended up putting it up a bit, so I'm not going to spend 2 days without stuff to cook


[31-Aug-23 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	I've only spent like 1k so far


[31-Aug-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	8h to station instead of a day


[31-Aug-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	might restart, now I understand stuff a bit more


[31-Aug-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Id rather wait a day than go bankrupt due to fuel costs


[31-Aug-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	If I need to make a day trip I tend to stay around 8h unless I'm in a rush, and like 12+ over night.


[31-Aug-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Helps a lot with fuel costs.


[31-Aug-23 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	yea


[31-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	You can also try to sell on the LM if you are not free to say money too.


[31-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Save*


[31-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Koran what zone are you trying to make that base?


[31-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Yea I'm doing a survey contract rn and I sent my ship about 2 hours ago so that it'll be done by tomorrow afternoon


[31-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Which base?


[31-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	BTS


[31-Aug-23 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	In the PB system?


[31-Aug-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	frick


[31-Aug-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	forgot about the local market


[31-Aug-23 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	well overspent on carbon lol


[31-Aug-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	@Moona is that what you mean by zone?


[31-Aug-23 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	If you go to map you can search RSS, XD and QQ are a lot closer with similar yield.


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Carbon when I started was close to 500 a month ago, that price is getting crazy.


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	surveys are usually not profitable, they are there to teach new players about setting up flights


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	TCW I am pretty sure early on I did not worry about smelting and just ssold the ore outright.


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	if you restart more than twice its get prohibitive


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	And I figured they were there for new players, I am a new player after all


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	yeah, I did that after fricking up my start twice, or changing my mind


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Restart  as in just make a new account?


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	no


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	liquidate


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	COLIQ is the command


[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Aug-23 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	In the video tutorials


[31-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Clean slate start


[31-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Well that is cool.


[31-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	After the third one the wait time is 60 days I think


[31-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	you could send a message to devs and see if they will reset or create new account on another email address (if you havent paid for PRO)


[31-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	FEO*


[31-Aug-23 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Very early on you only net money without really spending any.


[31-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	FEO has gone down but has little cost.


[31-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	to start yes, this is a metallurgy world


[31-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	50 per is not that bad.


[31-Aug-23 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	I was just going to smelt it to FE then sell, but if its more profitable to just sell FEO then I might as well just do that


[31-Aug-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Smelting makes you money but you need to invest in it.


[31-Aug-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	but get into AL processing or building Bfabs since FE production is not very profitable


[31-Aug-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Yea, I actually plan on hitting BTS asap


[31-Aug-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	12k+ per unit


[31-Aug-23 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Ya, making your own FE and the Bfaps is good, you can use them to expand or sell them.


[31-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Just keep in mind, bid and ask price are different.


[31-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	What is a bfap again?


[31-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Yea, the bid price I believe is 12k


[31-Aug-23 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Ask is like 14k


[31-Aug-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Things like the BSE you need to upgrade and build.


[31-Aug-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	down to 9,5k cash


[31-Aug-23 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ca-ching


[31-Aug-23 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Keep in mind there is 550 supply to 15 demand.


[31-Aug-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	That means there are 550 units for sale and only 15 buy orders up.


[31-Aug-23 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	That is over here but it is like that everywhere, people want to sell it but less people are buying.


[31-Aug-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Yea, but if I can become the main producer of BTS and Tungsten, then I can work my way into titanium and aluminum among other things


[31-Aug-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	I just want a foot in the door of BTS


[31-Aug-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	In case it booms


[31-Aug-23 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Not a bad idea, but not easy to do as a new account.


[31-Aug-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Yea ik its not easy, but Im prepared


[31-Aug-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	you appreciate that the buildng to process BTS is about 1m


[31-Aug-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Yea, I know I need to save up a crap load of stuff


[31-Aug-23 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Oh ya, AML, even I'm not close to that lol.


[31-Aug-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I can't tell you what to do but I would recommend stabilizing before trying to do that.


[31-Aug-23 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Thats the plan


[31-Aug-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	im currently top 20 for W production (30 day)


[31-Aug-23 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I produce about 10% of the top player


[31-Aug-23 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Damn bro, whats your net worth??


[31-Aug-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Dudes been playing for a year, so probably a lot.


[31-Aug-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Im guessing hundred mil at least


[31-Aug-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	I don't think It's that high.


[31-Aug-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	based on game figures 62M but the game treats goods slightly strangely and gives zero value to goods you produce so I'm probably 100M


[31-Aug-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	Idk how wealth scales yet

**Guzzette**:	There will never be an STL shortage


[31-Aug-23 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Moona**:	Ya idk if a shortage would happen.


[31-Aug-23 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Koran**:	I doubt it due to how essential it is


[31-Aug-23 04:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Koran**:	I was thinking it would


[02-Sep-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kirk_Peppers**:	If I want to start a new base at a far away planet with no other players and 0 population, how much money do I approximately need?

[02-Sep-23 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	it's a lot easier to plan production that way IMO - PRUNplanner doesn't have demand metrics AFAIK and it's harder to pop open the recipe menu to look at profitability and make decisions than it is in a full-page spreadsheet IMO

**TCW**:	yeaa


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	so iron ore can't be sold at a profit


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	full stop


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Then what


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	the cost of shipping it + cost of producing it is more then the lowest bid amounts


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Because Iron is what I know and do


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	and we cannot take loans


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	cost of fuel to move a full ship of iron + cost to mine the iron is ~42NCC


[02-Sep-23 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	lowest ready purchase is 40NCC


[02-Sep-23 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	so you'd have to list it on the market and hope someone gives and buys yours


[02-Sep-23 05:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	BlackAnthrax you also metalurgist?


[02-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i started as metallurgist on vallis originally, yes


[02-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I actually made a risky decision and brought loads of aluminium ore


[02-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	and I'm processing that, as it pays more


[02-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	You can be the leader of Iron guild and set the price for all iron ore and iron and we will all comply with your price


[02-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	however I have minimal liquidity now


[02-Sep-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that's not a risky decision. as AL is a pretty valuable metal since a lot of building prefabs and ship repair parts need it


[02-Sep-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Aluminium? Hmm


[02-Sep-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i am running 14 smelteries running AL here on vallis


[02-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	WHOWA. From where do you get the AL Ore?


[02-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	CX


[02-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	How does it get on CX? from what planet?


[02-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i can recommend to have a look at https://prunplanner.org it's a really valuable tool to plan your bases and production chains.


[02-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	processing the FEO to FE then to ST seems good too


[02-Sep-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	You mean STL?


[02-Sep-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@Paladin if you're interested in ALO, I could sell my next shipment to you. as I'm producing way more than I can process. Unfortunately we can't trade directly, so we'd need to do a timed trade on the CX


[02-Sep-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	I try to feed ALO to new players via the CX.  If I see a buy order from a newish player as the top buyer and I have stock I will usually fulfill it.


[02-Sep-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	carbon is the pricy thing right now


[02-Sep-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I would love to but now I'm at 3 NCC, if you can wait 1 more days I can make a little more and buy from you :D I never had ALO


[02-Sep-23 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Also, what's a good planet to mine ALO from?


[02-Sep-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	QQ-645b


[02-Sep-23 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	is it worth mining iron ore still, if I'm processing iron? I mean, I guess even selling at 2NCC negative, it's better then leaving staff unoccupied?


[02-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	dont worry about settling on other planets for the first 2-3 months.


[02-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Interesting planet but it has red pressure


[02-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	would need 8SME to process


[02-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	all the iron ore I'm mining


[02-Sep-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@TCW you don't need to sell on bid. you can set an ask price. and might need to wait a bit, but better than selling at a loss.. or better refine it to STL. STL currently has the 3rd best return on investment. after gold and titanium.


[02-Sep-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	can't afford the equipment for refining


[02-Sep-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you should have the starting materials for 1 EXT and 1 SME


[02-Sep-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	yeah, I have 2 EXT and 1SME now


[02-Sep-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	SAME :D


[02-Sep-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	but the SME is better off refining the 144 ALO I brought in


[02-Sep-23 06:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so you go 6 FEO + 1 C + 1 O + 1 FLX => 4 FE + 16 O => 4 STL = 5552 NCC


[02-Sep-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Why FLX tho? Is cheaper without FLX


[02-Sep-23 06:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	if you got ALO, refine it. you'll definetly sell it for profit


[02-Sep-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	get PRUNplanner


[02-Sep-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	it does all the calcs


[02-Sep-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	and shows because it runs faster, and refines more at once, it's more profitable


[02-Sep-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	if you use FLX you yield 1 more FE / AL and generally the FLX recipes are always worth it.


[02-Sep-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Paladin do you really have only 3 NCC to your name?  If you run out of money your factories will all stop


[02-Sep-23 06:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Aaaaa


[02-Sep-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	oof


[02-Sep-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Yes sir, 3,499


[02-Sep-23 06:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I didn't know that about the FLX, thank


[02-Sep-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	sell all your STL Fuel


[02-Sep-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	promise you won't regret it


[02-Sep-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	So 3k not 3 as written above


[02-Sep-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Oh


[02-Sep-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I was thinking what's after the "," is not important


[02-Sep-23 06:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	regarding FLX https://imgur.com/a/dlIe6h1

**BeBopLula**:	Okay you are safe atm


[02-Sep-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	in some countries they use , to denotate thousands


[02-Sep-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	WHOWWA You can make much more with FLX


[02-Sep-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	in some it is .


[02-Sep-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I'll send one ship tomorrow directly to market


[02-Sep-23 06:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	how come your numbers are a lot worse then mine?


[02-Sep-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Maybe he updated the prices manually

[02-Sep-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	mine are auto grabbed from the local CX


[02-Sep-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	And then focus on STL production. So ALO and FEO for FE and AL then STL also FLX for the ores. Thanks lads


[02-Sep-23 06:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i have an override for AL to set it to 500, because i have an exclusive contract with a friend to always sell for 500


[02-Sep-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	aah


[02-Sep-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	damn, that must hurt right now?


[02-Sep-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	it's up at 700


[02-Sep-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i don't mind. i have 6 bases. one of them producing AU.NC1


[02-Sep-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and CU.NC1


[02-Sep-23 06:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	nice


[02-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	MAT PG


[02-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	oopse


[02-Sep-23 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and technically that's not even my most valuable base. because my chemical base produces EPO.NC1 x294 per day


[02-Sep-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ok showoff :P


[02-Sep-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	xDD


[02-Sep-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Wait, so what is better, AL or STE?


[02-Sep-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	that might look like a lot to beginners. i was also in your position a while ago. but there's always a bigger fish


[02-Sep-23 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	You are big fish


[02-Sep-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	But I’m bigger


[02-Sep-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	:o


[02-Sep-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	o lawd


[02-Sep-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	That's what she said


[02-Sep-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Wait, no, that's wrong


[02-Sep-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	a leaderboard dig bick swinger


[02-Sep-23 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	Paladin - or is it?


[02-Sep-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	👀


[02-Sep-23 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	AL is slightly better than STL.


[02-Sep-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	anyway one of my ships is currently picking up ALO at my extraction base. i usually sell it locally on vallis to other paying players. but i would also sell it cheap to one of you guys and ship it to CX instead


[02-Sep-23 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	STL might win out if you factor in shipping maybe?


[02-Sep-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	thanks for the offer, that said I'm full out for the next few weeks with the 144 I got


[02-Sep-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	next week or so*


[02-Sep-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	@BlackAnthrax, I'll keep contact with you, I would like to try some ALO, I'll message you in like ~17 hours maybe we can have a deal


[02-Sep-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	STL weighs 7.85t @1388 NCC and AL weighs 1.35t @865


[02-Sep-23 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	tru


[02-Sep-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	WHOWA


[02-Sep-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	what


[02-Sep-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	144, they mush have costed a lot


[02-Sep-23 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	so a full STL shipment is 87k ncc and a full AL shipment 320k


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	Paladin, the real cost is the carbon


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I won t have 87k xD


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	24 carbon to process 144 ALO


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Interesting


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	YOU HAD MONEY FOR 24 CARBON?


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I emptied most of my cash balance lol


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i meant in terms of shipment worth. so the STL is worth more per piece, but not per unit of weight.


[02-Sep-23 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	down to like 10k


[02-Sep-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and logistics is constrained by volume and weight


[02-Sep-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	up to 15k now thanks to some of the contracts they give new players


[02-Sep-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	though I'm going to fail the newest contract


[02-Sep-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	because I really can't afford to get 2 wine grape units


[02-Sep-23 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	to provision them for said contract


[02-Sep-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	+ they cost more then the contract gives in return lol


[02-Sep-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Interesting


[02-Sep-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you mean the faction contracts? you have to be careful which ones you pick. some of them are really worth it. some are just stupid money sinks. so generally i'd advise against planetary exploration contracts


[02-Sep-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Yes, reject those ones


[02-Sep-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I didn't. derp.


[02-Sep-23 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Woops


[02-Sep-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	they want 2x 5,700NCC goods


[02-Sep-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	and will give me 6,775 in return lol


[02-Sep-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	+ one faction rep lol


[02-Sep-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	what do they want?


[02-Sep-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	Wine-Quality Grapes


[02-Sep-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	2 units


[02-Sep-23 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	rip


[02-Sep-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	why do beginners even get these kind of contracts


[02-Sep-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I'm an idiot for not checking before accepting


[02-Sep-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	yeah


[02-Sep-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	how much of an issue is it to just fail said contract?


[02-Sep-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	is it worth spending 8k or so to avoid failing it?


[02-Sep-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	next up an EDC for 5k in return xD


[02-Sep-23 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	lol


[02-Sep-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	so is it a big issue?


[02-Sep-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	just let it fail. as long as no step of the contract is fulfilled, you should not get a rep hit from it


[02-Sep-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ok


[02-Sep-23 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	cool


[02-Sep-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	my plan was to get up to 30k or so and build a BMP and make PWO


[02-Sep-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	which was at 10k per day


[02-Sep-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	but it's dropped massively for... some reason


[02-Sep-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	not sure what actually changed tbh.


[02-Sep-23 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	went from 10k profit to loss. Some price changed somewhere in the list, but the charts don't show any massive swings, so... weird


[02-Sep-23 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	PG and COT both got more expensive


[02-Sep-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ye


[02-Sep-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and PWO dropped in price


[02-Sep-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	and it does look like someone did wipe out a massive load of the PWO upper bidders


[02-Sep-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	just the average tracker doesn't show it yet


[02-Sep-23 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	someone made a lotta money


[02-Sep-23 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	at least there is a COT supply nowadays. a few months back COT was rare to come by and thanks to that prices exploded. I made a good buck on MED. but then everything recovered. and MED is now completely saturated


[02-Sep-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	heh


[02-Sep-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	what do you recommend as a direction to expand in general


[02-Sep-23 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	go tall or wide on tiers?


[02-Sep-23 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Go for profit.  The experts help make some items profitable but you can build new experts in another area quickly


[02-Sep-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	how does one get experts:


[02-Sep-23 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	An EPO base on Vallis does not make as much money as it would on Montem but it makes more money than an FE base on Vallis


[02-Sep-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	why is Hydrogen so unprofitable?


[02-Sep-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	like, for a base material?


[02-Sep-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	water too


[02-Sep-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	is it really cheaper for it to be shipped here from else where then extracted right here?


[02-Sep-23 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	given the extraction costs should be not far off eachother at most places, it just seems weird


[02-Sep-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Guzzette**:	if you want to make an EPO Base you need HAL come up to yi-705c and I will buy all the EPO you can make there


[02-Sep-23 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I most certainly can't afford to make an EPO base


[02-Sep-23 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	only FEO is worth extracting on Vallis and then only just worthwhile


[02-Sep-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	not actually worthwhile right now


[02-Sep-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	once you factor shipping to CX?


[02-Sep-23 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	unless you process it too


[02-Sep-23 07:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	welll, at least, selling immediately, Guess you could stockpile it at the station warehouse and hope someone graces you with a purchase


[02-Sep-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	yes, you would need to process it to FE to make worthwhile , the huge mass per unit of FEO means that it is not profitble to ship


[02-Sep-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	but also not profitable to process as you're better off buying ALO


[02-Sep-23 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	and processing that amusingly


[02-Sep-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	unless you get to the stage where you have 2 extractors, 8 smelters (and 16 collectors for oxygen if you feel efficient)


[02-Sep-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	smelting the FE to ST too


[02-Sep-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	dont use collectors for O, it is better to buy O


[02-Sep-23 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	true


[02-Sep-23 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	96 day payback lol


[02-Sep-23 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
***martin2610** joined.*


[02-Sep-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	then again, readily buying it is ~89 + a couple of NCC for shipping


[02-Sep-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
***TCW** deleted this message.*


[02-Sep-23 07:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	cost to collect yourself is 74


[02-Sep-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	RPI on entire base is 48d with collectors vs 24 days buying oxygen


[02-Sep-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I stand corrected


[02-Sep-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ROI*


[02-Sep-23 07:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	while you do save, the ROI time is doubled

[03-Sep-23 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	why do you use LM on moria station, if you could just put it on the CX?


[03-Sep-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	have to ship it to the CX


[03-Sep-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	ah, you put it on the vallis lm


[03-Sep-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I haven't got enough that it's worth sending a whole ship over probs


[03-Sep-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i somehow misread that as moria lm xD


[03-Sep-23 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	lol


[03-Sep-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	moria is the system name, so moria lm = cx lm.


[03-Sep-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ye


[03-Sep-23 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	Vallis LM


[03-Sep-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	hmm actually I will send it on a ship over to the CX


[03-Sep-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	I need to pick some stuff up


[03-Sep-23 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	can also wait until shipping contracts crop up


[03-Sep-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	seems cheaper to send my own ship


[03-Sep-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	early on I had one ship off doing whatever random shipping was available and another doing a MOR-VAL run every few days slowly accumulating shipping contracts and goods until a run was worth it


[03-Sep-23 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	yeah I mean take shipping contracts to offset the cost of the run and help fill your hold


[03-Sep-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	haven't tried that before


[03-Sep-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	i rarely see shipping contracts to locations i regularly visit


[03-Sep-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	MOR-VAL has been heating up lately wrt shipping contracts


[03-Sep-23 10:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	still not a TON but if you're quick there are enough to keep a starter ship mildly busy


[03-Sep-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	hmm good call. maybe i can fill my wcb ship the next time i need to fly MOR>Vallis


[03-Sep-23 10:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	you might have to wait a couple days but I rarely made the run without at least one contract onboard


[03-Sep-23 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	how do you offer shipping


[03-Sep-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(shoutout to the people who put a 5 day delivery deadline on their contracts, accepting those and then being able to wait a day or two until more cropped up to fill out the run was a huge benefit for me)


[03-Sep-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	you can't *offer* shipping, just request it


[03-Sep-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	ah ok


[03-Sep-23 10:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	so watch the LM for all the places you go to/from

[03-Sep-23 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127

**TCW**:	in fact a large number of things are into the negative for production


[03-Sep-23 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	like what? it might be that some things are currently produced in very large numbers and are only profitable if you're running at 150% or more efficiency


[03-Sep-23 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	looking closer it looks like a lot of them are just things in low demand

[03-Sep-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**TCW**:	yeah


[03-Sep-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	and then the supply gets bigger than demand and prices drop


[03-Sep-23 02:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Sep-23 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

Bullwhip effect
The bullwhip effect is a supply chain phenomenon where orders to suppliers tend to have a larger variability than sales to buyers, which results in an amplified demand variability upstream. In part, this results in increasing swings in inventory in response to shifts in consumer demand as one moves further up the supply chain. The concept first ...

**ZeWaka**:	Steel is possible but is a hard industry to start out in because experienced players can easily undercut you


[03-Sep-23 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	(I say this as someone who was undercut for months but now can sell at any price)


[03-Sep-23 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	my thoughts on that market is that it's pretty at capacity - not to discourage you though


[03-Sep-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	a lot of the big players will just make it in-house instead of on the CX due to the terrible shipping


[03-Sep-23 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	not that the products are much better


[03-Sep-23 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	It isn't usually worth the effort to refine FE into STL unless you've already got a channel to sell it.


[03-Sep-23 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Especially since you need to procure O on your own for it. Vallis isn't the place to get O.


[04-Sep-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	at market prices right now (probably a couple hours delayed) buying FEO and O and smelting it into steel is worth ~100 NCC/hour after salaries n stuff, *not* including shipping but also not including efficiency factors


[04-Sep-23 12:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(by "salaries" I mean "upkeep costs" since nobody gets paid in this universe apparently lol)


[04-Sep-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	smelting AL is worth ~116 NCC/hr


[04-Sep-23 12:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	smelting FE is ~73


[04-Sep-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	again all these numbers aren't quite right because it doesn't include efficiency factors, but they're at least correct relative to each other


[04-Sep-23 12:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	CU is ~216

[06-Sep-23 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	i assume you sell it to someone else via contract but you would need someone willing to buy it


[06-Sep-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	im not sure though as im still learning myself


[06-Sep-23 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-23 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emilanik**:	Okay i got the problem. I was trying to sell iron when i had iron ORE. Its solved, im just dumb eh


[06-Sep-23 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	i should have sent some cargo with my ships to the CX when i sent them off four hours ago

**TCW**:	story of my life XD


[06-Sep-23 05:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	i only thought of buying things and now i have 3 1/2 more hours of sitting here waiting at least


[06-Sep-23 05:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	So seeing as I made a bad deal with a guy on marketplace, what are the consequences for a corp that fails to hold up to it's side of the bargain?  I'm a bit irate over being out 50k


[06-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	what was the deal that you made?


[06-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	50j for 100  FE


[06-Sep-23 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	wanted to secure some because I ran out of FE for my factories


[06-Sep-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Now 4 of them are idling, and I'm a bit mad.


[06-Sep-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	oh well idk what happens but how much did you buy per unit out of curiosity


[06-Sep-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	500


[06-Sep-23 05:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	/unit


[06-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	ah ok thats about average here


[06-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	seemed fair, and I had the cash


[06-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	because even though every planet has iron ore theres a demand of like 6k iron and only like 2.3k supply


[06-Sep-23 05:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	i dont know why that is the case here


[06-Sep-23 05:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Someone a while back convinced me it was a losing proposition to get rich off of FE sales.  He was right too.  I now supply a good sliver of the BBH market


[06-Sep-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I also figured a contract with a 2 day deadline would have the metals on hand...


[06-Sep-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	cool im gonna try and go into the BSE market because even if it becomes uprofitable i would still use them


[06-Sep-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	wait was this the same deal you made eariler for the 50k for 100 FE


[06-Sep-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	100%


[06-Sep-23 06:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	Yep... the guy has 30 minutes and ticking to meet the deadline.


[06-Sep-23 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	huh i feel like youll either get your money back or just got scammed


[06-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Carefulrogue**:	I've never seen it delay in giving the other side resources.  I feel if it just gives it back, and docks rating, it's gonna cause inflation.


[06-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	hmm


[06-Sep-23 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Commander.Storm**:	well let me know what happens as im kinda curious


[06-Sep-23 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Sep-23 06:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

I can keep the build up if no one is in a position to use the SCI for a week or two but if you can utilise SCI then please let me know and I’ll release the workforce

[12-Sep-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	that's how I survived on BASIC


[12-Sep-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	That doesn't help when your queue is 3x shorter than your number of buildings


[12-Sep-23 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**scottgilb**:	the 100 I picked up will last me for 5 days and am down to 6K NCC until my ship get to the CX in 3 hours


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Awesome


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	Like, if you have 15 SME, 5 queue slots doesn't really do anything


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@ZeWaka add a time delay


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	?


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	Staggering still doesn't solve the problem


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	e.g place 20x orders


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**scottgilb**:	the 20 BBH 10 BDE 10 STL and 30FE onboard should net me about 85K NCC


[12-Sep-23 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	@ZeWaka it does


[12-Sep-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	at least until you check the next time


[12-Sep-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	Staggering just makes you need to check more often, you're still tied down


[12-Sep-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	well we live in a world of capitalism


[12-Sep-23 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	big bulk orders are better, but base storage and ship storage are issues


[12-Sep-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if the next best thing doesn't work.... well we're out of luck


[12-Sep-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**scottgilb**:	that is the nice thing about recurring orders doesn't matter how may you have they will keep running


[12-Sep-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	I've stopped using recurring orders for the most part nowadays


[12-Sep-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	a habit from my BASIC days


[12-Sep-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-23 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Sep-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	same


[12-Sep-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	that still only brings you up to 11kt


[12-Sep-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	5000t warehouse on Vallis


[12-Sep-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	2500t on Verdant


[12-Sep-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	which is free btw


[12-Sep-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	shameless plug for Verdant's free public infrastructure


[12-Sep-23 05:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	11000t is nothing when it comes to bulk steel production though


[12-Sep-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	guess you'll have to hire a bunch of couriers


[12-Sep-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	via shipping ads


[12-Sep-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	no, the issue is you can't do bulk orders


[12-Sep-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or deals


[12-Sep-23 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	i can ship it fine if if it's not 20x orders


[12-Sep-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	then that means you're going to check anyways


[12-Sep-23 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	20x orders being 40 steel aka 300 steel a day for my current setup aka 2,400t


[12-Sep-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	if you have time to check ships, you can spam click a button 10 times for smelters


[12-Sep-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or 15 times


[12-Sep-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	the problem is you're chained to checking at specific non-repeatable times


[12-Sep-23 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	yeah We need to start a petition to the devs for features like these


[12-Sep-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	you can't just check at 1pm every day, since nothing in this game is timed like that


[12-Sep-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	not to mention the size of the inputs as far as weight goes...


[12-Sep-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	my inputs generally hover around ~7000t alone


[12-Sep-23 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	and that's with 2x orders, not 20x lol


[12-Sep-23 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	and 70,000t of input weight is not feasible


[12-Sep-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	746 t at 15x SME per ~12hr (size 2 orders)


[12-Sep-23 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	*747


[12-Sep-23 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	yes, now multiply by 10


[12-Sep-23 05:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Sep-23 03:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	The number in brackets represent ghost plots (new players joining on XYZ planet). Established players can't make bases on XYZ planet once it hits the limit.

[13-Sep-23 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I have a farm on verdant and live a peaceful life :) - What a great advice. Just wanted to add a base on montem but that's not possible as it seems...


[13-Sep-23 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	How is TO-392-d? It seems to be harder to build a base there...


[13-Sep-23 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I like TO-392d - but need an HSE and INS source so it isn't cheap, but it is an excellent place to build B-fabs, lots of FEO/LST.


[13-Sep-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Bunch of shipping ads on MOR CX to Vallis


[13-Sep-23 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	is HSE and INS just necessary once when building the base or do you have to repair with HSE and INS?


[13-Sep-23 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Sep-23 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	@TCW I have, that doesn't mean anything. I supply most of my inputs lol


[13-Sep-23 11:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes from that perspective Proxion would be an easier option to source LST


[13-Sep-23 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	I don't think the risk depends on having a PP3 or not (there's plenty of HSE and INS on the CX). The risk is just that the planet has higher costs to build and repair so you want to make sure your plans are worth the extra cost


[13-Sep-23 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	Me personally, I love that I can have a setup there where I don't half to haul in the heavy stuff FE/LST, and pick up enough BBH/BSE every week or two that it easily covers my costs of running the base


[13-Sep-23 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Me, I checked the profit with prunner and running the construction buildings on TO-392d is not that profitable. I think I will just source LST weekly to Vallis.

**YuriYB**:	question from a beginner: i set up my extractors, smelters and pp1 and everythings working, but the rising carbon prices are bleeding me dry. should i set up a temporary farm+incinerator on vallis, build a base on montam or try n save up to build a base on verdant?


[14-Sep-23 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**YuriYB**:	i guess what im asking: how much difference does fertility make in the long run?


[14-Sep-23 01:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You could consider sending a ship to Benten or Hortus, where C is cheaper.   Alternatively buy ALO and make AL which has more Profit and so is not as impacted by C price.


[14-Sep-23 01:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Or buy FE and make STL which does not use C.


[14-Sep-23 01:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**YuriYB**:	thanks for the tip, so its not advisable just to get my hands on some carbon? i would really like to keep my production lines running as is, so i can build my building material myself


[14-Sep-23 01:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	At current C prices, it is possible to carbon farm on Vallis, I was suggesting other options that don’t need as bigger an asset sink as such an approach.


[14-Sep-23 01:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Carbon farming on Verdant is more profitable than FE smelting on Vallis (especially atm).


[14-Sep-23 01:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Currently no space on Montem so that’s not an option for you


[14-Sep-23 04:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**YuriYB**:	oh i see, thenk you!


[14-Sep-23 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Well, with current C prices FE and STL should be rising in prices as well. However especially STL was flooded on the CX lately and there seems to be less demand than production so prices of STL seem to drop. I already thought about getting out of STL production too.


[14-Sep-23 08:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	There are a large number of people who manufacture their own C for smelting, for them the current price rise is not relevant (economically it should be but game players are not usually economists).  So there will be a lag between C price rises and it’s impact on other prices

**dakota1234**:	not actually sure


[14-Sep-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	well, the wording i sin clear simple english. free player can FLY 2 ships at a time.


[14-Sep-23 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	A good. But I can have more than 2 ships in the fleet but not flying at the same time. Very nice. How much would be a new ship?


[14-Sep-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	no idea on the cheap side. jsut getting a 2000t carrier for about 5.5m


[14-Sep-23 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Hmm, something cheaper? Like this cheapest ship?


[14-Sep-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	as I said - no idea. But lets not ignore that the small cargo space may be cheaper, but the hyperdrive is a LARGE part of the cost.


[14-Sep-23 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Vounter**:	Imagine the cheapest ship is the saturn V


[14-Sep-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	The thing is that I'm at a point where I produce a lot and cannot carry everything xD


[14-Sep-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	So I need a new ship


[14-Sep-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	nope, that is not true. yo ucan as well sell stuff locally or put out shipping contracts

**Paladin.**:	I'm a free user


[14-Sep-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Can't


[14-Sep-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	well, then welcome to a world where that has limits. pay up


[14-Sep-23 03:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Never


[14-Sep-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I'm going to buy new ship with money earned in game


[14-Sep-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	ah, now THAT sounds awfully like a freeloader. buy a ship, but you can still only fly 2 at a time.


[14-Sep-23 03:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	the moment you expand just a little more that is the same limit. you are better off saving up and changing your ships out - get another cargo hold, get some larger tanks, cheaper


[14-Sep-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	That's not a problem right now becuase I can squedule them. They already make 2 hours on the trip


[14-Sep-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Maybe I can use less fuel


[14-Sep-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	WAIT, I CAN CHANGE THE SHIP SIZE?


[14-Sep-23 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	well, you can make a project to change the ship out, put in as I said some changes - also an idea to change the hull plates. A million or so helps here. YOu MAY need to pay for the game for a month to have access to the shipyars.


[14-Sep-23 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	which is always the issue - iirc you can not buy ships as a free player either. There is no ship trading - "buying a ship" is getting the parts and paying the shipyarrs to handle the project, and i think that is not in the free player side. But that is a month only. And yes, yo ucan also rework ships.


[14-Sep-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	I see, the upgrade is free tho. The building of a new ship requres PRO. You are a genious and a savior sir DrTom


[14-Sep-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	I changed both my ships to carry 1000cm/3000t (never buy the 1000/1000 - that is wasted). also get light hull plates and definitely larger tanks


[14-Sep-23 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	It will take a while but thank you so much sir!


[14-Sep-23 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	and again, it is about a millioon - WAY cheaper than a new ship. see, hyperdrive ;)


[14-Sep-23 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Paladin.**:	Yes sir!

[14-Sep-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	2000/2000 cargo holds will be more expensive but more suited for most goods


[14-Sep-23 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ZeWaka**:	only get a 3000:1000 or the opposite if you ship goods needing it


[14-Sep-23 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DrTom**:	yes, but if you need capacity fast, 1000 is the way to go - and 1000/1000 is never the best choice, there is no compromise to go with the 1000/3000. 3000/1000 is rare use - pretty much only some cases where it makes sense.

**clanogrady**:	Now hold on, people go with the wcb since you don't need to upgrade he crew quarters.


[15-Sep-23 01:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Going 1000/3000, or 2000/2000 requires a medium crew quarters. Thus if you are building from scratch, it makes sense to go with those but for upgrading starters you go with the wcb

**BeBopLula**:	In defence of the MCB, it is a better upgrade if you are mainly shifting Gas products.  The high volume freighter is very expensive with the need for CQL and extra plates

**MoLab**:	Is it possible that the income statement (financial overview) is wrong? I have material consumption as costs but material production is missing in the income.


[24-Sep-23 03:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	It is just calculated when it is sold, not when it is used up by building new bases for example.


[24-Sep-23 03:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kirk_Peppers**:	As far as I know it doesn't count the materials you produce in the income category in any way until you sell them


[24-Sep-23 03:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kirk_Peppers**:	And as for the bases I think it doesn't count any materials you produce yourself or recieve in the faction contracts but if you buy the materials on the commodity exchange it will count it in the fixed assets "bases sections" part


[24-Sep-23 03:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kirk_Peppers**:	Basically anything you produce is 0 value until you sell it, even if you use it in the construction of your base AFAIK

**dakota1234**:	is there any particular reason to not just throw the STL up on the exchange with an ask price of what you actually want?


[24-Sep-23 11:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(or maybe I'm misunderstanding "hoard" I guess I think of that as keeping it at your base/off-exchange)


[25-Sep-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Yes at the moment you earn more by selling FE instead of STL and the O separately on the CX. The STL market crashed.


[25-Sep-23 12:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	At a price of 500 for FE and 151 for O 1200 for STL is about break even so you do not earn a single penny at 1200. That is without adding depreciation to the calculation.


[25-Sep-23 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	At a price of 92 break even is a little lower than 1000 though.

**Eloyen**:	Hey! Started playing like a week ago, and yesterday when I logged out I had a Finance Result of like +30 000 NCC. But today when I logged in it shows at -1 200 and I only se 4 Recent Cash Transactions so I cant see why it dipped 30 000. Anyone know what happened to my money? :P Did I miss something?


[25-Sep-23 08:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	The Financial result is a Calculation of revenue minus expenditure, it is calculated in real time but it is reset to zero every week.  Reset happens on Sunday so the value you are now seeing is only you purchases and sales from the last 24hrs


[25-Sep-23 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	You have not lost any money.


[25-Sep-23 09:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Eloyen**:	Aah, very nice! I though "Result" was how much NCC I have, not now when I look at ti again I guess my money is "Current Assets"?


[25-Sep-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Yup current assets is your current cash, the game does an exchange rate calculation on cash in other denominations.  As a new start you will have a thousand in each other coin type

**scottgilb**:	I can beleive the demand for steel has dropped 400ncc here hoping the market picks back up to 1250 per think I will hoard all my produced steel until then

[25-Sep-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	and I can't really upskill to hull plates as the markets have already been demolished by my 7x HWP setup so much that the prices are still low, even when I stopped bringing in supply to the CX


[25-Sep-23 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

**YuriYB**:	beginner herre, with a problem: i have a shipping contract and i have brought the package to MOX, but every time i try to turn the shipment in, i just get a "fulfillment attempted" and the shipment still sits in my cargohold. how can i fulfill my end of the contract? the cargo is filling up all my available space


[30-Sep-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	@YuriTB it seems the party that offered the contract does not have anough space on the destination


[30-Sep-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	they need to clear up space in order for you to fulfill.. if they don't react and the time of the contract runs out, you can breach the contract and the other party will be penaliized


[30-Sep-23 06:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

**ErdnussMaus**:	assume i want to see my production, then the command would be PROD c812fd6d79082d86debc7d5e94953467


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ErdnussMaus**:	but how is it intented to be accessable?


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ErdnussMaus**:	currently i am looking for my workforce


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	BS in the left sidebar gives you a list of your bases... then slect the base and then hit the production button


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ErdnussMaus**:	you right, but i wanted to split a window and directly access it


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ErdnussMaus**:	maybe its not intented to be used like that


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ErdnussMaus**:	thx


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	then split a window and drag that buffer into it... you have to drag using the internal title bar, if that makes sense.


[05-Oct-23 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**ErdnussMaus**:	yep thank you

[06-Oct-23 02:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	unloading alone does not fulfill contracts. you have to click the fulfill button in the contract itself

**Neospring**:	Is my contract showing up in moria-vallis?


[09-Oct-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Since you have only just started, are you talking about a starter contract?


[09-Oct-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	Nope, looks like I need a recipient for the contract draft?


[09-Oct-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	Oh I see, I need pro license to send contracts then the only way to buy oxygen and carbon is from the commodity exchange?


[09-Oct-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yep that's it.


[09-Oct-23 08:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BeBopLula**:	Yes, only PRO accounts can create contracts on LM.  Only PRO and Basic accounts can accept (Basic is anyone who has been PRO but isn’t currently subscribing)

[09-Oct-23 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The location.  They refer to the two commodity exchanges in the NEO Charter Faction.  The NC1 exchange is located at Moria station and the NC2 exchange is located in Hubur Station.  For reference, Hubur station is on the far outskirts and therefore, little used.


[09-Oct-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Neospring**:	Do I need to rent a storage unit to sell on the exchange?


[09-Oct-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	No, you can sell from the ship. If you buy smthng on CX and you havent storage or ship - you can find your goods in a conts


[09-Oct-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	technically you could load commodities directly from a ship onto the exchange, but realistically you need to rent a warehouse unit


[09-Oct-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	:)


[09-Oct-23 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Neospring**:	So why is Carbon more expensive then Iron?


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	It's how the game works lol, supply and demand


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	FE.NC1 C.NC1


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	plus you can smelt 4 iron with 1 carbon using the flux recipe


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	iron's quite expensive atm compared to what it was before (as with everything else haha)


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	My profit is in the negative with the prices of carbon being so high and price of iron being so low...


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	just mine the ore


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	or further refine the iron into steel/ construction fabs


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	FEO.NC1


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	I am, but the problem is I need carbon + oyxgen which cost more then the price of selling iron


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	so sell the ore directly or make prefabs


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	I see, so don't bother going down the iron selling route until the price spread is bigger?


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	probably the best choice for a starter like you


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DogeConomy**:	(bigger companies can just hoard stockpiles of iron while they wait for the price to rise back up again)


[10-Oct-23 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Neospring**:	Makes sense, I figured bigger companies probably already have iron miners


[10-Oct-23 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**starWanderer**:	and O


[10-Oct-23 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YuriYB**:	As a beginner who tried to farm C myself: I can't recommend it, unless you have a base on Verdant or similar already. O is easy enough, just set up some collectors, done. But for C you first have to builds rigs for the water, then grow your crops, then incinerate them. It's a huge investment with low return on Vallis. Especially if you're specialised in something else and have your experts working there. In the end i dismanteled everything and switched to scaling up my PP1 productions. But thats just my opinion :)


[10-Oct-23 02:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Yes, of course. But i do that before Verdant and it works

***starWanderer** deleted this message.*


[10-Oct-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YuriYB**:	I didn't say it didn't work :) I said I wouldn't recommend it after trying it myself, just because I feel specialised bases are way more efficient


[10-Oct-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I produce C at Verdant. That was an excellent decision.


[10-Oct-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	We are discussed about first base on Vallis :)


[10-Oct-23 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**YuriYB**:	I don'T know if I'm just slow on the uptake, but i've been playing for like 6 weeks or so and the money for construction parts for a base on verdant still seems some distence away for me :(

[16-Oct-23 12:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the one wrinkle is that if you don't have either a warehouse or a ship at the CX (commodity exchange) then you'll receive a contract to pick the stuff up, which can be confusing since it looks like the stuff you bought disappeared until you check your contract list

[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	ALO is just mad high on the CX right now


[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	and SIO I have less of a good reason but hey if someone is willing to discount it then I'm happy to save them the shipping


[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	How much you need?


[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	And how much you willing to pay?


[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	depends a bit on distance but for ALO looks like around 150? there are a couple CX orders higher than that but not many


[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	if your willing to go get it on celebdil i could do 160


[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	thats a 20% discount on bid


[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Oct-23 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Oct-23 02:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	STL is currently relatively expensive to make as it needs 4 O per STL , I would look at AL, as it's almost the price of STL and relatively cheap to make.

**Gotische_Revolution**:	from my (very limited) experience it is probably easier to just make iron in the beginning. I started with iron expanded into steel then tools and then faming to carbon. So my setup is pretty wide, however oxygen prices have since risen quite a lot.

**dakota1234**:	sorta two answers


[20-Oct-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	one answer is playstyle - you can do whichever you like, or both even


[20-Oct-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the other answer is to use either https://prunplanner.org or your own spreadsheets to figure out which is more profitable


[20-Oct-23 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(though there's a pretty good chance that which is more profitable will vary over time)


[20-Oct-23 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PixyTheFemboy**:	thx!


[20-Oct-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	np!


[20-Oct-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	generally people do ag on Verdant so you may find it hard here on Vallis but if you want to then don't let that dissuade you :)


[20-Oct-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(I know there are at least a couple people that do ag here so it's not unheard of)


[20-Oct-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**PixyTheFemboy**:	I figured I'd be able to cut down on transport costs, but I did consider doing verdant


[20-Oct-23 11:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Lots of opinions, Metalurgy is best - you can make a pile of SME and just buy the ore on Moria and resell the metal.


[21-Oct-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Or a bunch of GF or FS to make large quantity of things easy to sell, but margins aren't huge - but they are very light to move.


[21-Oct-23 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Or higher level players will go the blast furnace / hull welding plant route to make higher end things - but check on demand before you go too far with this one.


[21-Oct-23 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	you could go into HWP for example, you need a good chunk of SMEs for 1 HWP anyway

[23-Oct-23 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Oct-23 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Lead time depends on the ship and of course how many orders are in the queue. We had a couple key people step away from the game last summer and that totally messed things up for a while. We're running pretty smoothly now. Orders of most ships are cmoplete in about 7 days.


[24-Oct-23 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Regarding sign-ins for the Google forms: it's the only way it can work as far as I know. We've setup the forms so that they do not collect any emails or personal info. Just the in-game user name and Discord user name so we can communicate about the order.


[24-Oct-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Note: I think I fuigured out why Google was asking for a login: the from autosave feature was enabled. I've turned that off so I think it should be okay without a login now. Please try again and let me know


[24-Oct-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	Ah I was wrong - since we ask people to upload a screenshot of a custom ship order Google requires a logon. I can't get around this. Sorry.


[24-Oct-23 09:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Nov-23 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Nov-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	Yes I have gone through the tutorial


[10-Nov-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I think I have to start production for the first thing


[10-Nov-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ok good, so you built some things?


[10-Nov-23 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	no nothing yet


[10-Nov-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I don't know how to do that


[10-Nov-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I should say - you constructed some buildings?


[10-Nov-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I am on this recommended starter buildings


[10-Nov-23 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	and it says construct


[10-Nov-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	it says that I have to build two hb1 and two bmp but I have missing materials


[10-Nov-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Did you build anything else already?  You should have enough to build the starter buildings.


[10-Nov-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I just built two hb1


[10-Nov-23 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	how do I check it?


[10-Nov-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ok, so do you have enough to build 2 bmps?


[10-Nov-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	yes


[10-Nov-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I built them


[10-Nov-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ok, great. Now you are ready to start production


[10-Nov-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	yes


[10-Nov-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	So go to the production tab


[10-Nov-23 09:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You can get there multiple ways


[10-Nov-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I am clicking on new order and and in the production tab in the input materials it says units missing


[10-Nov-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I am in the production lines rn


[10-Nov-23 09:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You might need to change what you are producing - try to make some PE


[10-Nov-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You can change what you make in the "Production Template" "button"


[10-Nov-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	on the new order screen


[10-Nov-23 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	got it


[10-Nov-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	Should I start the queue order


[10-Nov-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yep


[10-Nov-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	It will take 7:55 hrs


[10-Nov-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Sounds right


[10-Nov-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	ohk


[10-Nov-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	So what do I do by then?


[10-Nov-23 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I really don't understand this game


[10-Nov-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Lots of planning for what to do next


[10-Nov-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	uhm okay


[10-Nov-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	What to produce next, what buildings to construct next, buy consumables, try to figure out the markets


[10-Nov-23 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	Idk what to plan


[10-Nov-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You should check out Prunplanner, Rain's spreadsheets or make your own spreadsheet to help with planning


[10-Nov-23 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	They are tools outside of the game but they are very helpful


[10-Nov-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I gotta hop but you are off to a good start.


[10-Nov-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	okay


[10-Nov-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	Cool


[10-Nov-23 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	I am not understanding much but okay


[10-Nov-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	It'll take time


[10-Nov-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I think the first things to plan is when to fly the produced items to CX to sell them and buy new raw materials for additional production.


[10-Nov-23 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yes, there a lot to learn and it takes time to do it


[10-Nov-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Buriuddin**:	cool


[10-Nov-23 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	And don't forget to have enough RAT, DW and OVE

[10-Nov-23 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	You can also reach the build menu by clicking on the BS menu item on the left, then selecting VIEW BASE, then CONSTRUCT

**SaintIsidore**:	Is the mobile interface good? I've only used the browser version.


[15-Nov-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	(I understand mobile is also in a browser)


[15-Nov-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	It’s a pain


[15-Nov-23 09:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	but once you get used to it, it’s useful when you just need to send a ship or something else time sensitive

**Ravick**:	If it is one of the faction contracts, then I do not think you can get an extension

**PixyTheFemboy**:	Ah dang.


[16-Nov-23 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prismfloof**:	Do NEO contracts even have time limits? All mine just have a time since I've gotten them


[16-Nov-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	yes, many do have time limits.


[16-Nov-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Prismfloof**:	Ah so I'm assuming the starter/tutorial ones don't?


[16-Nov-23 10:38 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SecretAce**:	I'm being an idiot here, took a delivery contract from the LM. My ship has arrived at the destination with the shipment and I've received the money but I can't get the shipment out of  my ships inventory so I can't actually complete the contract


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Does it say "fulfilment attempted"?


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	It say's partially fulfilled, but the button to fulfill for the delivery shipment in the contract is greyed out and I can't drag the shipment into my warehouse inventory either


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Are you at the right destination?


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	Yea, delivery point is moria station


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	Is it maybe because I don't have enough space for it in my warehouse? It's a bulky package


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	oh wait no


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	I do have enough space


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Care to share a screenshot?


[22-Nov-23 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BlackAnthrax**:	if it's the correct shipment the button should be clickable, regardless of storage space. if your contact partner does not have enough space, it will show fulfillment attempted


[22-Nov-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	How can I send a screenshot in here?


[22-Nov-23 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	Wait never mind, it's sorted itself, must have just been lagging or something

**Metalnickle402**:	how is it so hard to get DW at moria, ivehad an order in for almost 2 days


[24-Nov-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Very


[24-Nov-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	whoever filled that thank you


[24-Nov-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	H2O production is kinda difficult for the mor station, followed by then having to process it into drinking water.


[24-Nov-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	I've been here shy of two weeks so I'm still getting things set up :)


[24-Nov-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	What industry are you going into?


[24-Nov-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	metallurgy


[24-Nov-23 01:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	actual hobby of mine


[24-Nov-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	hooooh boy, have you got anyone else you are working with?


[24-Nov-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	nope


[24-Nov-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	should I?


[24-Nov-23 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	you could look into turning the metals into prefabs


[24-Nov-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Mettalurgy by itself isnt very profitable


[24-Nov-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Just that supplying all of the inputs together can be difficult, and ^


[24-Nov-23 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	I'm working on getting a carbon farm going so I can start the higher grade stuff


[24-Nov-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	i would advise focusing on scaling up your main "thing'


[24-Nov-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	You get productivity bonuses to metalurgy and construction


[24-Nov-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	so more than one extractor


[24-Nov-23 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	other people can do the carbon more efficiently which you can buy on the exchange


[24-Nov-23 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	I'm trying to get a DW production line going so all I need is the OVE and RAT which seem to get filled pretty quick


[24-Nov-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	A lot of that is very much things for when you already have a stable income. If you want to focus on metallurgy as the main means, then seeing if you can get suppliers for the inputs would be best.


[24-Nov-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	Kinda wish I'd know metallurgy was so hard to get started with


[24-Nov-23 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	same here


[24-Nov-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	thats why prefabs is a good way to get some value added on your metals


[24-Nov-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	That's the way I've gone but even still that's taking a while to get set up and is a bit of a pain


[24-Nov-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Also consider doing some trading. My first month in the game was 100% trading then with the money i was able to get some real scale on my production


[24-Nov-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	What did you trade?


[24-Nov-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Anything I could get my hand on haha made about 4mil


[24-Nov-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	I've got C, O, FEO, production. If you guys have pro/basic, then a bunch of standing contracts to fill as they get in can be done.


[24-Nov-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	And yea, some people just float between exchanges and capitalize on the price differences.


[24-Nov-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	also, once you have a handle on what you want to make, consider getting a loan


[24-Nov-23 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	Loan? How does that work


[24-Nov-23 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	you borrow cash then pay back with interest


[24-Nov-23 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	just gotta find a player to bank roll you


[24-Nov-23 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SecretAce**:	Ah so it's a player thing, wasn't sure if there was a game mechanic for it

[27-Nov-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Currently the corporation structure is really just a way for individuals to share a chat channel.  The devs may have future plans to expand the corp capabilities.  You can invite people to join a corp but the corp itself does not have any assets.  The corp is a bit different if you are governor but still of limited usefulness.


[27-Nov-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Don't forget the Headquarters, which can be built on a planet and all CORP members get a bonus to efficiency on that planet.


[27-Nov-23 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Nov-23 07:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	All the taxes and fees get paid to the corp of which the governor is a part. So by forming your own corp as governor, and being the only company in it, you receieve all the taxes and fees. It just makes financially managing a planet much easier

**Age-Kahn**:	@Godert Welcome! Early game is quite slow, but joining a corporation and surrounding yourself with veteran players can help. The knowledge they have and financial resources can help speed up the beginning game. If you want to join a corporation, DM me and I can invite you to GTU. Someone is likely to give you a loan or boost to help out in the early game!

[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Hi Ravick, can you deliver regularily?


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	how much would you need?


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	im also willing to offer financing for the materials


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	18 AEF


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	i can have it ready in about 3 days


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	Hello everyone. I just started the game on Metallurgist prof. Like... what do I do? What is my purpose???


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	4.5k/u if you pay today, 5k/u on delovery or 5.5k if you pay day after delivery


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	I mean... I understand that I probably have to produce/export metals, but is metallurgist a good prof to begin with or should I restart or what? I have seen ppl in global chat starting with victualler  and going to other professions


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	And now I don't know what to do


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	i would say metal isnt an easy start


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	but its still very doable


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	consider producing prefabs using the metal


[28-Nov-23 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prismfloof**:	I've just been selling the metal


[28-Nov-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	using the FE in a PP1 is a good way to increase margins


[28-Nov-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	mhm, okay. thanks for the advice. I have only iron at the moment


[28-Nov-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	well... will have in like 10+ hours


[28-Nov-23 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Use the slowness of the game to learn


[28-Nov-23 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	its slow at first but its an exponantial curve


[28-Nov-23 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	42.  Seriously though, basic idea is to make money.  Metallurgist doesn't do that very well on it's own, so get a PP1 ASAP.  Then make and sell BBH, BDE, BSE and BTA.  Collectively referred to as Bfabs.  ... And the entire thing was said while typing this.


[28-Nov-23 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	okay, will do. thank you


[28-Nov-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	4,5k sounds good


[28-Nov-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Also this is one of the friendliest communities i have seen, dont be afraid of asking questions


[28-Nov-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	sure


[28-Nov-23 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Molab, you can send the contract with the terms you need. Give me 4 days for the stuff to give a buffer but itll likely only take 3


[28-Nov-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	im dependant on a shipper bringing me some NE to strat the batch


[28-Nov-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prismfloof**:	This literally is one of the nicest communities I've been in. I've asked so many questions on the discord and everyone has been nothing but nice, it's amazing


[28-Nov-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Probably because there is less competition and more make money off of each other.


[28-Nov-23 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	iv aslo not seen any toxicity


[28-Nov-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Prismfloof**:	excel nerds


[28-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	sooo... If I understand correctly, I need 4 BSE, 3 BBH, 3 BDE and 76 MCG to build one PP1... I have exactly 0 of all of those materials. How do I buy them?


[28-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	Generally, how to obtain these materials in the early game?


[28-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	there are 4 CX (commodity exchanges)


[28-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	the closest is moria station


[28-Nov-23 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	youll have to fly a ship there


[28-Nov-23 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	4 main CX + 2 smaller remote CX


[28-Nov-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	smaller = less well used


[28-Nov-23 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	for most people they may as well not exist


[28-Nov-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	okay, so I fly my ship to there... If I use as little fuel as possible, it will be there in 6 hours. What next?


[28-Nov-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	buy the stuff then fly back


[28-Nov-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	aha, okay


[28-Nov-23 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-23 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	So how are all those shipment offers on local markets done? They offer xy tons any commodity.


[28-Nov-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prismfloof**:	It's a prepared shipment of one type of commodity


[28-Nov-23 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prismfloof**:	You just can't see what's being shipped


[28-Nov-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	So I could accept it and won


[28-Nov-23 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	So I could accept it and wont know before what will be shipped?


[28-Nov-23 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	You still won't know.  It comes as a singular item called "Shipment #xxxxx".


[28-Nov-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Ah I get it. I cannot offer that I would ship for someone else. I can only offer that I want my goods to be shipped. Thanks


[28-Nov-23 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Prismfloof**:	I think it's to discourage piracy or something. I've seen people talk about how they ship like 100k worth of a commodity on a shipment that only costs them like 2k or something


[28-Nov-23 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-23 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	1 more question about universe map. What do those hexagon letters mean? The "OP", "QQ","OZ" and others. Are these just random letters to differentiate between sectors of universe or do they have set meaning?


[29-Nov-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The closest shipyard is on Pallada (SHY OT-580d) - take a look


[29-Nov-23 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I believe that the devs just cluster systems together and use those "QQ" "QZ" designations to group them.  They show those clusters on the map to make it a little easier to navigate visually.

**zanechuryk**:	Hey new player here wondering how much Iron I should save up before loading it up and selling it at a trade center


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedstoneKlara**:	Depends really. I just my first sorta Iron I produced just to get the starter contract done, but you'll have to make that choice for yourself depending on how often you want to make trips to the Trade Stations. It's gonna be a matter of figuring out if you have enough to have profit enough to justify the fuel costs


[29-Nov-23 07:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**RedstoneKlara**:	In Moira, the bids for FE are kinda low, at least in Moira, so I'm gonna have to think about selling in bulk to be able to justify making the trip considering the costs of the raw materials (ie Carbon)


[29-Nov-23 07:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zanechuryk**:	Oh okay I see so since we're in Moira and it is a Iron producing system selling in bulk would be preferred but what would be bulk like 100 Iron?

**Omegano**:	Are you Pro?  If so, looking at the Local Market and seeing if Iron is on sale.  If It is, you have a price that you can use to put it up there.

[29-Nov-23 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	On the LM, 50, 100, 200, etc.  Round numbers.  For getting it to the CXL, I agree with the above.


[29-Nov-23 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**zanechuryk**:	Ah I see thank you very much this helps a lot.


[29-Nov-23 10:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Shrewdsun**:	@TCW you want to upgrade or build from scratch


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	probably build from scratch


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	how much of a price difference?

[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Upgrade is about 750k from scratch you are looking at about 4-5 mil


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	that can vary a lot thought if you have contacts


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	yikes!


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	well, I've saved up enough either way, just need to work out what stratgy really


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	I would say, unless you really need it, another base is always a better investment than a ship


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	and need more shipping capability I think


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	do all my HAL mining on one planet


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	then chemical processing on the other


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	I would say upgrading ships and shipping less often is probably a better investment


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	hmm


[30-Nov-23 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127

**clanogrady**:	if you have the 2 starter ships, with that much money sitting around it would be better upgrading them.


[30-Nov-23 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	Generally, the first upgrade is going to a WCB with the 2 starters. The increase in weight capacity is usually the best price/upgrade ratio. (Purely my opinion)


[30-Nov-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	can someone sell me all the materials to upgrade both ships to weighty bois?


[30-Nov-23 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TCW**:	and recommended build


[30-Nov-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Otherwise, look at the cost per unit at the CXL, and then use that plus a little more.  Convenience is not free!

**Anettera**:	love these short travel times to station <3


[30-Nov-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I would recommend playing around with the ship blueprints (BLU).  When you have a blueprint for the WCB ship then you can visit a shipyard (SHY OT-580d) and find out the exact materials required.


[30-Nov-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	"visit" was probably not the right word.  Pull up the shipyard in Pallada and find out the materials you would need for the upgrade.


[30-Nov-23 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Be3eR**:	Hello everyone! So, I am metallurgist and I figured that there is no reason to produce small patches of FEO when you can wait for 2 weeks and get 280 units of it. But it says "no capacity". What does it exactly mean when it this error occurs? It confuses me even more, because I have plenty of space in my base's inventory...


[01-Dec-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Be3eR**:	Does it have to do with not meeting required population stat/demand? I am 20 people short on staff


[01-Dec-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	AFAIK that only shows when you don't have enough inventory space, I'm not sure what else might cause it


[01-Dec-23 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	looks like 280*7.874t = ~2205t of storage space necessary


[01-Dec-23 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	If your base is empty, you can hole 190u of FEO.  I would aim at 100-150, for space for other things.

**CJ1212**:	Is it possible to make direct trades with players and make long-term supply deals?


[03-Dec-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CJ1212**:	I'm fairly new, just figuring things out


[03-Dec-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	You can (with Pro/Basic), but it will not be the game itself making those deals a thing.  It will have to be something you do outside the capabilities of the game, more of a promise made outside the game.


[03-Dec-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	*more like a


[03-Dec-23 12:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	The reason you need Pro/Basic is for player contracts.  That and the Local Market really the only ways you can trade outside of the Exchange.

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for new(er) players who would like to upgrade to WCBs. I offer 2 options: standard (WCB+LFE; 470k ICA) and enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL; 650k ICA). You must (1) have PRO license and (2) be under 180 days old. Pickup will be at MOR. DM me if you are interested :)


[03-Dec-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Cheap, indeed.  Now I am sad about not getting a discount... :P


[03-Dec-23 02:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	(Just made the purchase, ship still upgrading "just")


[03-Dec-23 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FalconHawk76**:	when a contract says "Provisioning of shipment" Does that mean that you need to make it yourself or is it provided?


[03-Dec-23 02:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Does it say NEO Chart or whatever next to it?


[03-Dec-23 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FalconHawk76**:	yes


[03-Dec-23 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Then you don't supply it, they do.  Likely is an extra reward.


[03-Dec-23 02:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Omegano**:	Hi!


[04-Dec-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	what's a respectable setup for a fresh metallurgist, right now I'm skimming by with two collectors doing O, one Extractor for FEO and two smelters for FE/STL production. Is there anything I should be pushing towards to help boost income?


[04-Dec-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Unless you want to not use the CX for some of your input, Bfabs.  First tier Construction.  Meaning get a PP1.  itch the collectors and get another PP1.  Aim for a ratio of 1 EXT / 2 SME / 4 PP1. Shipments from MOR will need to include LST and PE.


[04-Dec-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	I think that's the best to get going early, then you can shift the construction parts to a 2nd base, eventually.  That's my plan, at least.


[04-Dec-23 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	You could add a few BMPs, and then ship in H and more C instead of PE.


[04-Dec-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	I would say get rid of the COL for O better of buying on the CX


[04-Dec-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	I’d also say consider getting a loan


[04-Dec-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	It's crossed my mind a time or two, but I've been more worried about knowing what to get set up so it doesn't crumble


[04-Dec-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	You use PRUNplanner? If not, I highly suggest it. https://prunplanner.org/


[04-Dec-23 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Dec-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	If you at the CX, this is pretty much the price


[05-Dec-23 08:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	Since you are free you can’t do a contract so you have to buy at the CC


[05-Dec-23 08:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Scottyy**:	Are contracts worth doing if they will be a net loss?  Just for the reputation?


[05-Dec-23 08:48 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Dec-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pauchu**:	You need pro to post ads, just not to buy off the market


[06-Dec-23 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bacchasnail**:	ah ok


[06-Dec-23 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Pauchu**:	sorry man


[06-Dec-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bacchasnail**:	its alright. how do you get a rating?


[06-Dec-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pauchu**:	You will get contracts from your faction over time


[06-Dec-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pauchu**:	If you fill them you get a better rating


[06-Dec-23 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bacchasnail**:	ah ok make sense


[06-Dec-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	ill go ahead and assume that is MCG and not MGC


[06-Dec-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Shrewdsun**:	else its a graet deal haha


[06-Dec-23 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pauchu**:	that is why i corrected it


[06-Dec-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	No no hold up, the Faction rep is different from the rating.


[06-Dec-23 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**clanogrady**:	The rating is a pro/basic thing. It is based off of the contracts you fill with other players.

[11-Dec-23 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	@metalnickle402 I am guessing you started out in metallurgy. I went with the PP1 because then I could take the FE and turn it into various bfabs which I could use to expand my own base or sell for more profit than FE alone. If you go with the BMP, it requires more expensive workers and you'll have to buy and import various materials. With a pp1 you'd mostly have to import LST to start to make good money which is easy to do on Vallis, Montem, and MOR

[13-Dec-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Depends, some people get loans from more established players to upgrade. Once you have the money, you just pay for the parts and take them to a shipyard with your ship!


[13-Dec-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Metalnickle402**:	What's with the blueprints though, I dont get that part


[13-Dec-23 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	You have to have a blueprint to build a new ship or a "target" blueprint to upgrade. It basically says what you are going to build or upgrade to. So you have to create the blueprint to match what your final ship will look like and then the blueprint tells you what parts you need and lets you start the building project

[14-Dec-23 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Dec-23 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	I believe that is the best option for starter ship upgrades. Anything more than that and you might as well build a separate ship since you lose any existing components in the upgrade process


[14-Dec-23 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	@mintchocoo Depending on how active you are and how much you enjoy the game, your first ship upgrade could be a month, maybe two away. Or sooner if you get a loan from someone to expand your base faster. You will eventually need to upgrade your ships to progress with your company

**DYSIODE**:	Does it make sense to incorporate steel production early on? (like, my company is 3 days old kind of early)


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sigmundth**:	I assume that you are doing metallurgy, i.e. running an extractor and smelter for iron production?


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sigmundth**:	If that is the case, then getting a collector to provide for your oxygen needs is helpful and the excess can be used to make steel.


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sigmundth**:	one other thing is that you should go and get flux [FLX] from the commodity exchange since buying carbon is likely to be a significant cost early on and flux will reduce the amount of carbon required for a given amount of iron.


[15-Dec-23 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sigmundth**:	You might also want to get the nonessential workforce needs, [COF] and [PWO], in small amounts to boost your efficiency.


[15-Dec-23 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I considered a collector but the excess, at least on the initial extractor/iron smelter combo didn't seem cost effective vs. a second extractor. It doesn't seem like a single collector on Vallis would cover STL production anyway


[15-Dec-23 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Good tips on the FLX and luxury consumables though, I did get FLX since someone mentioned it but I didn't realize it's main value is reducing the C cost, that stuff is expensive!


[15-Dec-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	My other short term consideration is building a PP1 so I can produce my own base components. It seems like the ~4k price difference would even out after ~4 days and then I'd have a PP1 and another SME


[15-Dec-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	I knew that flux gave a better return for value, but it is only now that I have had it pointed out to me do I fully realize Why.

[15-Dec-23 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Dec-23 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Spiotwo**:	Somebody in this chat earlier recommended that as a new player you should aim for 1EXT/2SME/4PP1, and I basically did that. Any advice for what should I aim for next? I'm thinking of building farms, FPs, INCs and a BMP to make my base more self-sufficient, but is that a sound strategy? Does it make more sense financially to expand iron/prefab production instead?

[17-Dec-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Spiotwo - this planet has a COGC of metallurgy, that means that any metallurgy buildings get a 25% bonus (ie make things faster).


[17-Dec-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	So things like smelters work great here (I have 8 of them) - also glass furnaces making glass are another great one.


[17-Dec-23 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I would be willing to either buy all the AL you can smelt, or buy all the GL you can make (for the GL I can supply the NA and SIO, I don't have a source for ALO)

**MoLab**:	Yes that's true. That means you won't get the 25% bonus for your 4 PP1 because they are construction. But don't mind, I personally do not focus on the 25% bonus too. I rather try to keep logistics costs low.

[18-Dec-23 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The faction points are just a reputation ranking.  I think that in theory the higher your faction ranking the better the faction quests you are supposed to get.  But I think the general view is that the faction contracts actually don't get better the higher your reputation ranking.  Others might have different views...

[21-Dec-23 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I also recommend getting comfortable with some of the commands. I use CXOB all the time, and make sure you use all caps (because reasons), so like `CXOB FEO.NC1` oh, and make sure you're clicking on the right things. So many things are hyperlinked that if you say want to look at your inventory (INV) when the Buffer opens the "Open" action button is hidden so you'll naturally click the location name and that opens up details on the location


[21-Dec-23 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-23 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Dec-23 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Scottyy**:	You can increase production but have the same queue length.


[23-Dec-23 10:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scottyy**:	So going from 1 to 2 doubles your production so you will go through your queue twice as fast and need to 'check in' twice as often

**--SCHAITR--**:	Hi folks, I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for new(er) players who would like to upgrade your starter ships to WCBs (3kt/1km3 capacity). I offer 2 options: standard (WCB+LFE @ 470k; basic requirement for upgrade) and enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL @ 650k; larger fuel tanks add range). You must (1) have PRO license and (2) be under 180 days old. Any currency is fine, and pickup will be at MOR. Reminder that I do not provide hull plates or SSC for the upgrade. DM me if you are interested :)

**Fero**:	Well is the early game just sitting around and producing your preffered item of choice and then selling it?


[02-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The early game can be a little slow but there is a lot to do with planning your expansions to your current base and planning additional bases.  If you have Pro then shipping contracts can be a great way to get ahead.


[02-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	So collect money to expand and become more self sufficient


[02-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	Then look to better areas to get a base


[02-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	That is definitely a good path forward


[02-Jan-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Check out the community resources as well there some useful spreadsheets and planning tools that you should learn


[02-Jan-24 10:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	But I need MONEY.. and I spent it all on coca cola and food for my base


[02-Jan-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Those workers...needing to eat - the nerve :)


[02-Jan-24 10:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	Exactly!


[02-Jan-24 10:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	come on, they drink water


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	And "caffeinated infusion" which is totally not coffee


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Shipping contracts seem... like you're just trading fuel for an equivalent amount of money, in a you'd be better off selling the fuel


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	kind of way*


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	not usually, if you see ones like that then they're bidding too low


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	@DYSIODE you can to build your rules \o/ :)


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	some of these players play on newbies or empty cargo, they can to wait \o/


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	i saw a contract for which i was flying with empty cargo bay ))


[02-Jan-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	and it was a fat cont)


[02-Jan-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	for efficiency of rigs, extractors, and such how big of a hit is it if the bar displayed on the planet is around 15%?


[02-Jan-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	working on my first base and day two of playing so still feeling it out so I was curious as I was debating on adding Oxygen to my prod chain on my starter planet but looks pretty low on availability of the resource


[02-Jan-24 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	currently a starter metalergist with an Iron chain going but didn't realize the oxygen and carbon would be a big holdback for production


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	the game have to be hard


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Make sure to use the FLX.NC1 recipe, it's ultimate benefit is to reduce your Carbon cost


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	and O too


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	O doesn't scale well, I'm not even sure it's worth the consumables the workers use


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Also make sure you're completing faction contracts, I feel like most of my money in the first two weeks came from those


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	ok thank you was work a thought. I have the spare workforce so it was more the cost of the build which I grabbed already


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	worth*


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	There's a bunch of tools people recommend (there's a whole Discord for it), but I've primarily used https://prunplanner.org


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Note: Your unemployeed workers don't consume resources


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	thank you I saw that one recommended on a youtube video earlier


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	ahhh didn't realize that


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	much to learn of course but doing the research where I can


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	still, I'm pretty sure you can recycle most of the building's materials so you can always swap out of it later


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	yeah :D It's fun, there's a lot of planning and learning that is the "gameplay" for the first week or so before you start to have things to trade


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	that's what I was thinking. I am already scouting other base locations with better efficiencies but will be a bit before I can afford a 2nd base


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	reminds me of the part of eve I enjoyed. I was an Indy guy there and played for years but the pvp shenanigans and trollish nature wore me down


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	@lowstrife is the game's bank effectively, so if you think you'll stick with the game long enough to drop $8 to get access to player contracts you can get a jumpstart with a loan from him


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I personally am enjoying building up naturally


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	oh nice thank you. Yeah I am already considering pro. Just wanted to give it a few days before I decided. Feel out the community and such


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I was just a "run around and mine shit in my Procurer :D


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	kinda of eve player*


[02-Jan-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	yeah I was a rorq and carrier pilot myself. Did my share of mining lol


[02-Jan-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	but was mainly in capital production


[02-Jan-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Yeah, I gave it about a week before I pull the trigger since a pro license turns into a basic license letting you accept contracts, just not make your own which I don't think I'll do much


[02-Jan-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	but did have a sb account for when I got bored and wanted to blow things up :chuckles:


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	Yeah I typically stick to paid accounts to support the dev's having been a dev myself.


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	They deserve the loving afterall


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Yep! If I'm still playing in 4 months time (when my Pro runs out) I'm going to get a supporter pack


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	nice. How long have you been playing?


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	3 weeks today apparetly 😄


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	Good to hear. Atleast it is a range of players new and old with continuous growth. Some of the browser games start well but gets filled with big fish and newer players run quickly lol


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MDRACONUS**:	Astroempires was good for that lol


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	True, though this is a newbie planet, so we're just providing a good example of how welcoming the community is ;))


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	This is a newbie planet?


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	real?


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	It's one you can start on, that doesn't mean it's not full of long term players, there's not much reason to leave a system with a CX


[02-Jan-24 04:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Its one of some planets, where new players starts on


[02-Jan-24 04:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	Hello Vallis - For the new players, I'm the governor of Vallis.  So I'm responsible for maintaining the planet's infrastructure and running planetary programs.  Most of this takes place in the background and you might not notice it ingame.  Many of you are likely aware, that most planets operate at a deficit, so the tax revenue is lower than the expense of running the planet.  This is true of Vallis as well.  I would like to increase the taxes over the next 2-3 months to reach a breakeven tax rate.  I believe the impact to each player will be very small and perhaps negligible.  This is an open topic for us to discuss so please post thoughts, responses and questions in this chat so that everyone can see them.


[03-Jan-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	By taxes you mean the production taxes?


[03-Jan-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	I wouldn


[03-Jan-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	I wouldn't mind them being raised just a little bit


[03-Jan-24 09:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	They're super low as is


[03-Jan-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Phostration**:	I appreciate the explanation and agree that most if not all players likely will not notice much of a change.


[03-Jan-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yep, there would be a small increase in production fees.


[03-Jan-24 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You can see the amount that you pay in production fees across all of your bases (not just Vallis) in the income statement (FINIS)

[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	What kind of a deficit are we talking about WRT to Vallis? And what kind of increase would we need? My production fees are ~2% so even if they doubled I don't think it would be a huge impact


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Are fees a flat rate across industries? i.e. could we keep fees low on say metallurgy, but raise them more on construction?


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	(or vice versa, to encourage more diversity)


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	oh I see! Yes


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I would like to spread out the increase over a couple of months so we have some ability to adjust.


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yes, you can change fees for certain industries but I would rather keep them all the same for each worker group (All PIO same fee, All SET same fee...)


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ultimately, I think we need about a 25% increase in fees for breakeven.  Keep in mind that the fees are a set currency amount rather than as a % of something.  So as the game experiences currency inflation from market makers or new players, the taxes do not automatically compensate for this.


[03-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	So the process will continue.  Once we get it to breakeven, then very shortly after it will start to run at a deficit and that deficit will grow over time, and then we will need another tax rate reset.


[03-Jan-24 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	@DYSIODE, so you have 1 base and it is on Vallis, your 2% production fees might rise to 2.5% after the revisions.


[03-Jan-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Across my 17 permits in 8 bases, I pay 65k in taxes per week, but I make several mil a week so increasing the taxes will be negligible.


[03-Jan-24 12:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	Our focus as citizens of Vallis should be on making sure the income for the governor is stable enough to support the planet long-term.

[04-Jan-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Hello Ravick, I have become governor of Sabaton - a planet with much smaller population so not compareable with Vallis. The first action I took was to cut spending by half because Sabaton had an infirmary running at level 4 and a safety station at level 5. They are both at level 2 now and I still reach over 90 percent in health and safety. So I thought I check the spending at Vallis and from what I can tell it seems reasonable. I think you are doing a great job and I do not have any issues if you raise taxes.


[04-Jan-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Kralhex**:	Yeah they are all 50/115/225/1080/1800 rn, ty for the heads up beforehand @Ravick


[04-Jan-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	For reference, they were at 45/100/200/900/1600.  I expect the final increase, for this rate reset, next month, and it should be about the same amount of increase, so PIO would go to 55, SET to 125 and so on.

[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kralhex**:	You mentioned most planets run a deficit, is there a penalty for running out of capital, or is there an incentive to grow wealth in a planet?


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kralhex**:	Wealth as in in the hands of the government not the players


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kralhex**:	I guess you could run higher lvl buildings and services but is it possible to pay for material cost of planet wide structural projects from government capital, like a local market, shipyard etc?


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	I *think* (correct me here someone who has actually been governor) that the finances of the government are mixed in with the governor - unless they create a specific separate corp or something, the money is just "theirs"


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	so yes they can then use it to buy goods n stuff for upkeep/construction/etc. but it's not a totally separate pool


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	So for instance Ravick has been buying C and O and bringing it here to sell under the CX price on the LM


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kralhex**:	So deficit for a planet is charity from governing player basically


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	and usually using transport contracts etc. to move it, which also helps new players


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	yeah that's my understanding


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(again I haven't actually been a governor so hopefully I'm not totally wrong here)


[04-Jan-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kralhex**:	What you said makes sense, for a new player(me) fuel is a bigger portion of production cost than most other players so selling something on the local market for slightly cheaper instead of running to the CX everytime would be very useful

**Ravick**:	@kralhex so the game is set-up so that the player that is the governor receives the tax revenue from the planet.  Technically, it's a special purpose corp in most cases in which the player is the only member but that's doesn't really matter.  So the governor receives the tax revenue personally, I get some amount of NCC every month.  Then the governor is responsible for using that money to pay for government expenses.  So when there is a deficit, it is funded by the player that is the governor.


[04-Jan-24 12:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Being governor is kind of like having a base that you run but rather than making money everyday it loses money every day.


[04-Jan-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Most governors understand this and accept it as part of the gig, but sometimes the deficit can get a little out of hand, in which case we just have to make a minor adjustment to the tax rate.


[04-Jan-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The O and C that I sell on planet is not really related to the revenue and expenses of governorship.  Just trying to help people out beyond running the government.


[04-Jan-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	In my prior post, I meant that I received tax revenue every week, not month.

**DYSIODE**:	Are the governmental expenses the things like CoCG upkeep? Obviously I imagine it's far simpler to pay taxes and you buy all the upkeep goods, but does it make sense to advertise those costs for people to chip in?


[04-Jan-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sigmundth**:	I think taxes/production fees are the best to ensure that those who benefit the most also pay the most.


[05-Jan-24 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	For all who thought otherwise, Sabaton does not make me rich as governor. The relevant taxes are at 5 NCC so 10% of the tax rate of Vallis. That is only possible because we have volunteer planet supporters who pay for the popi.


[05-Jan-24 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sigmundth**:	wrong chat I think


[05-Jan-24 12:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	No, it is a follow up for my post for Ravick.


[05-Jan-24 01:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	One thing to note is if you look at the pop report, Vallis has ~11x as many pop as Sabaton and is running at 50% health and 40% Safety and Comfort, so if anything we should be running even more infrastructure (though it's not clear how those number impact production)

**DYSIODE**:	I started as a metallurgist, is there any particular reason to say move into AL production vs. C production? i.e. is there any intrinsic Metalurgy bonus I have because I started as one or did it just provision me with the stuff for it?


[08-Jan-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Strake**:	On Vallis we get a 25% bonus to metallurgy which would lean you a bit towards AL over C production. But that's because of the planet bonus. I don't think your starting package gives you any bonuses, just the materials for that set of starting buildings

**banuka**:	what do most metalurigist do first. i'm still pondering what's the next move after the first two three weeks. still prodicing iron and selling them in CX. is there a META or at least a decent plan

**starWanderer**:	@banuka Its a sandbox, you can do what you like


[11-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	@banuka Look at the things you can produce using pioneer buildings and then look at the CX prices to see what can be sold for most marginal profit.


[11-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	On vallis you mainly produce iron locally so look for recepies that use iron. Also keep in mind that some products have close to 0 demand so you basically can't sell them, look for those with high demand


[11-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	I recommend either building Welding plants and producing GCs (Cylindrical Gas Container), or PP1s and producing BBH and BSE. Both of those give around 2k in profits per production cycle, with the bonus that you can use the prefabs produced by PP1s to build new buildings instead of bying them on the CX.


[11-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	Also a large chunk off your profits probably goes to buying carbon on the CX, look into building INCs to produce it locally from plants bought on the CX, that cuts a lot of your spending


[11-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	A good ratio of buildings imo is 1EXT/1INC/2SME/2PP1, multiply as needed


[11-Jan-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	You would run an INC on Vallis?


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	Well yeah the math checks out


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Yes it could have been a strategy. I waited with my INC until I had my base at Verdant. But now I think it might not matter if you transport plants to Vallis or C directly...


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	2 SMEs take about 5C per day to operate 24/7, on the CX thats about 3k, produced locally 1INC makes ~5C per day using 4HCP+2GRN, 1.5k on the CX. So 50% reduction in cost


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Yes it makes sense, just a hydroponics farm on Vallis does not make sense because there is no water on Vallis.


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Well there is some water but little


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	By the way Spiotwo, I found a contractor for the lab on vallis.


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I definitely found the PP1s most helpful, prefabs are forever in demand at a stable price and being able to go "oh, I can build another building" because you have the parts is great


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	My struggle has been it seems like the market for higher tier items is... extremely slim, I assume because a lot of transactions happen within Corps or player to player?


[11-Jan-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Also, I can't overstate the value of faction contracts

I offer 2 options: standard (WCB+LFE @ 470k; basic requirement for upgrade) and enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL @ 650k; larger fuel tanks add range). You must (1) have PRO license and (2) be under 180 days old. Any currency is fine, and pickup will be at MOR. Reminder that I do not provide hull plates or SSC for the upgrade. DM me if you are interested :)

**banuka**:	your buying price was 14.00NCC.  the lowest offer is 27.10NCC


[18-Jan-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**banuka**:	so it is in the list


[18-Jan-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**banuka**:	you probably mixed up the quantity and the price


[18-Jan-24 03:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**banuka**:	if you put the price as 400, that would probably kick a fuss


[18-Jan-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Benjamin_Drauger**:	ah okay thank you. Will try that


[22-Jan-24 11:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-24 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[22-Jan-24 11:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DYSIODE**:	`WAR MOR` in a new buffer will take you to the warehouse screen. You can also get to it from the "planet" info, which is where the Local Market (if you're Pro/Basic) and other planetary services are. You'll want a warehouse to buy stuff into if you don't have a ship stationed there, for example


[23-Jan-24 02:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	When you create an order on the CX though it holds your money/goods in escrow, so you shouldn't need to leave the ship there, but 100 NCC a week is not a fee you have to worry about

**YuriYB**:	what does WCB for ships stand for?


[24-Jan-24 08:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i guess i have only two questions.. will metallurgy always be this slow? and Is it smarter to focus one one industry or to fan out into multiple ?


[24-Jan-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	WCB is a cargo bay kit - it is a 3,000 ton / 1,000 meter capacity - great for heavy things, not so good for light but bulky things like fuel.


[24-Jan-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Matallurgy - some things are slow, others arent (look at the FS) - in terms of future - good to keep to one industry per planet, so a metallurgy world (Vallis) a chemistry world (Montem), etc.


[24-Jan-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	This is because the COGC per planet is only for one industry and gives a 25% bonus, and also Experts - each additional expert generates a better increase.


[24-Jan-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Thus it is better to have 5 experts in one industry (28.4% increase) versus one in 5 different industries (15% increase)


[24-Jan-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	whats the FS ? sorry if thats a dumb question XD


[24-Jan-24 09:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-24 11:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	That said, Metallurgy is generally pretty slow, but everything in the game is generally pretty slow, there's no sprinting (though sometimes you choose to dump fuel to get consumables back to the planet in time lol). Once you get into the rhythm it won't feel as slow


[24-Jan-24 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	In fact, Agriculture is even slower! MAI.NC1 takes a whole 24 hours to grow!


[24-Jan-24 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	but I'm 6 weeks in and have a new base planned that's going to take me ~10 days to build the supply for. The only way to short circuit that would be to take a loan (holla at lowstrife) which is a completely valid choice, but I personally prefer to go solo in that regard


[24-Jan-24 11:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	All said, stick to pioneer buildings for a while, there's plenty of money to be made in them, especially since you're mining your own consumables (and because FE.NC1 is reeeally high right now for some reason)


[24-Jan-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Also, to Craftsman's credit, even though Vallis has O for example it's generally more expensive to produce it yourself than buy it. I use https://prunplanner.org/ to help visualize those costs (it's not super intuitive to start using but once you figure it out it's extremely helpful)


[24-Jan-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	oh, and one final thing to add to my mini lecture is PP1s are great even though they're not "Metallurgy" because it means you get a consistent supply of building resources you can use for yourself or sell

**banuka**:	how do you increase the inventory space in the base? tried to rent a warehouse but that did not increase the capacity?


[24-Jan-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Jan-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**banuka**:	oh. missed that. thanks a lot


[24-Jan-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the warehouse is a separate inventory rather than adding onto your base; you can find it in the inventories tab or by opening up the warehouse page (same place you rented it) and finding the "open store" button


[24-Jan-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Jan-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for new(er) players who would like to upgrade your starter ships to WCBs (3kt/1km3 capacity). I offer 2 options: standard (WCB+LFE @ 470k; basic requirement for upgrade) and enhanced (WCB+LFE+MSL+LFL @ 650k; larger fuel tanks add range). You must (1) have PRO license and (2) be under 180 days old. Any currency is fine, and pickup will be at MOR. Reminder that I do not provide hull plates or SSC for the upgrade. DM me if you are interested :)


[26-Jan-24 09:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**NgURoyalZ**:	i have a question regarding experts. i was under the assumption that to even count towards expert generation a prod line has to run at at least 100% efficiency. but i just got a extraction expert when the line is only at 79% ? im confused


[27-Jan-24 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Running at lower efficiency just means they appear slower. They still appear

**NgURoyalZ**:	i see. thanks for the info


[27-Jan-24 07:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Jan-24 11:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	yes i am aware of the handbook. but it nowhere states what i was asking ?? where do you think my confusion and first question came from. bc in the wiki it says "The days indicated above relate to a single building at 100% efficiency." nowhere does it say that it just goes slower if below 100% or faster if above.


[27-Jan-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	to add to my confusion, it provides a formula on the experts boost depending on workforce satisfaction. it doesnt provide a formula for expert generation so i found it logical to assume there isnt one. and the only condition is the 100% efficiency prod line. if under no generation, if above no bonus.

[29-Jan-24 05:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Joe.Pineapples**:	if you have two of the same buildings (eg Smelter)  can you get a separate production line for both?


[29-Jan-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**banuka**:	yeah. you can have multiple buildings and they do their own line


[29-Jan-24 05:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	but not from the same type (eg. lots of Smelters)


[29-Jan-24 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Scottyy**:	Noob question :) -- I'm looking at some of my earlier buildings and their repair costs.  Example, I have a SME that is 63 days old with a condition 97.4% which has minimal impact on my production efficiency (99%).


[30-Jan-24 11:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scottyy**:	Surprisingly the cost to repair is high in comparison to the new build cost...my question....when do players typically worry about building repairs?  Any guideline?


[30-Jan-24 11:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	At 45 or 90 days, typically.


[30-Jan-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Note At, not after.  45 and 90 are large tick-overs, meaning you want to do it as close to that number of days but not on them.


[30-Jan-24 11:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Or I'm getting it wrong, and it is 46 and 91 that are the large ticks.


[30-Jan-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Omegano**:	Anyone can confirm which it is?


[30-Jan-24 11:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I'm not sure about the tick timing, but I typically repair at around 90 days


[30-Jan-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scottyy**:	I will plan on repairing on day 89 :)


[30-Jan-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127

[01-Feb-24 08:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Advice :: forget gold, smelt TIO/TI - easier to move.  If you want to do gold, go to QQ-082b where you can mine it, smelt it, then turn it into connectors like BCO/etc (the only real use for it).

[06-Feb-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Ainz, what do you produce?


[06-Feb-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Steel at the mo, start on Iron, and now smelting Iron and Steel and selling the steal. Using all funds from Steel sale to buy more smelters


[06-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Do you extract your own iron ore?


[06-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Im still a noob 82days old


[06-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	+ Did you buy more extractors to increase that?


[06-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I'm only about 3 days in myself


[06-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Also doing metals


[06-Feb-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I know I can transport about 63 iron to trade, and can profit about 17k each full transport if I buy carbon,oxygen,basic needs and fuel when my ship returns


[06-Feb-24 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	So I am on Vallis, so FEO is good. So I have 2 Extractors and 7 Smelters (with another loads of builing comps on way back to base to make anothe smelter). The 2 Extractors produce me 28 FEO every 13 hours, enough to cover Smelting, I need to buy in Oxygen tho, as only have 3 collectors and they dont produce what I needIts a good game it u stick at it.


[06-Feb-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	2 extractors is covering 7 smelters?


[06-Feb-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	FLX and C u shud buy for Iron. FLX smelting is more efficient


[06-Feb-24 05:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Oh flux reduces the time required a lot and gives 4 iron?


[06-Feb-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	No my extractors do not cover anywhere near the Oxygen I need. I have to buy it in. The 3 I have just help a little. They are not effienct on Vallis


[06-Feb-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yeah FLX is good for Iron Smelting


[06-Feb-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I mean extracting for Iron Ore


[06-Feb-24 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I produce 14 units FEO in about 15 hours and I need 6 Iron Ore to smelt into 3 iron but that takes 10 hours


[06-Feb-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Ah sorry, mixed up. Yeah extrators are good


[06-Feb-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	2 of them produced 28 FEO every 13hrs for me


[06-Feb-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Do you have about 2 extractors for each smelter (maybes something like 1.2 for each smelter)


[06-Feb-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Have a stockpile of FEO, never sell it (not worth it)


[06-Feb-24 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Yeah doubt I'll sell FEO when I can smelt it


[06-Feb-24 05:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yeah save FEO, sell Iron, work towards steel or whatever u fancy


[06-Feb-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Ah Flux does save a lot of time, I'll factor that into the spreadsheet


[06-Feb-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	That saves about 30 hours or something


[06-Feb-24 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[06-Feb-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yeah FLX smelting is much better


[06-Feb-24 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Czupurek**:	Hello, im new here. Is it worth buying materials to build a second Smelter with starting capital?


[07-Feb-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I'm fairly new too, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's what I've been doing.  The original two extractors should be enough to provide ore for up to four FEO>FE smelters, and you get paid a lot more for FE.


[07-Feb-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I've put most of my capital towards additional smelters, but they're actually split between FE and STL to maximize steel production, which pays a lot more yet.  The goal is to eventually have 4 SME for FE and 4 for STL, which convert all of the ore to steel.


[07-Feb-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	You have to import a crapton of oxygen to supply eight smelters though, but the economics seem to work out.


[07-Feb-24 09:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	my next layer is going to be BMP's producing power tools (PT), for even better margins.  I've bult my first BMP even though I have only four smelters so far, and will likely upgrade in waves to convert as much FEO into PT as possible at every step, I think that maximizes profit.

[07-Feb-24 10:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Czupurek**:	Hi Retread, thank you for the comprehensive information. I didn't think about what to do next after producing Fe :) It looks sensible


[07-Feb-24 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	You're able to transport 63 Iron with a starter ship, so if you're not using the flux recipe, you need 21 Oxygen per shipment to a commodity exchange, you need 16 oxygen if you're using flux


[07-Feb-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	So I create iron ore by extracting, and when I drop iron off for trade I buy basic consumables, 16 flux, 16 oxygen, 16 carbon and then return to trade


[07-Feb-24 10:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	might buy fuel too


[07-Feb-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Math might be wrong tho


[07-Feb-24 10:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	the oxygen really only becomes a concern once you're producing steel - 8 O per two FE adds up fast.


[07-Feb-24 10:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I can't see the extra time requirement for steel making it worth it too


[07-Feb-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Bc if you think about it, oxygen costs you like 100 per unit, so steel costs you 12 hours more time, costs you an extra 800 and you get like 1400 back per unit of steel


[07-Feb-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	huh maybe it's worth it actually


[07-Feb-24 10:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	400ncc per 1 iron


[07-Feb-24 10:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	To get steel at 1400 each

[07-Feb-24 10:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	with my current 2 EXT / 4 SME setup, my math works out to a profit of roughly 73k a week, including everything but fuel and depreciation.  If I split my smelters 2 and 2 between FE and STL, that mostly converts all of the iron to steel and my profit rises to 112k per week.


[07-Feb-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**de71**:	I've been working towards a 2 ext, 7 sme setup (4x FE smelters, 3x STL smelters). seems pretty efficient


[07-Feb-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Sorry - made a mistake.  The split smelter setup would only give me 80k per week - steel prices have dropped


[07-Feb-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127

**de71**:	That's something I never considered - I'll probably work on expanding into PT production next. Still pretty new so just taking it step by step.


[07-Feb-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	My strategy will be to convert all of the iron I make to steel, and convert all of the steel to power tools, building smelters and BMPs in waves to always upcycle as much FEO all the way to PT as possible.  More profits = faster build cycle.


[07-Feb-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	unless everybody starts building power tools and the market gets flooded.


[07-Feb-24 11:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**de71**:	Nice. I need to consider more collectors to cut down on importing Oxygen costs too. Might focus Oxygen production on a more efficient planet but I haven't looked into that yet.


[07-Feb-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	from everything I've heard, don't do it on Vallis.  cheaper to buy imported O2 than to try to make it here.


[07-Feb-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**de71**:	Good to know. I'll salvage my existing collector when I'm in a position to expand and consider collecting O elsewhere.


[07-Feb-24 11:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**de71**:	Or just continuing to import...


[07-Feb-24 11:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I tried to extrapolate out, too.  2 FEO extractors are enough to supply 4 SMEs making FE, which can supply 4 SMEs making steel, which can supply 12 BMPs making PT, for a profit of 520k a week.  Total construction cost would be 775k including the 18 HB1's you need, and the total footprint would be 460 area, so should only require the one permit.


[07-Feb-24 11:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	And I've been thinking along the same lines as you - should the second base be an O base to cut reduce raw material costs.  O planets seem pretty far away, and I need to work through what else I can do with the oxygen.  It might be better to continue paying for it and set up a base with completely different production elsewhere.  Diversification, y'know.


[07-Feb-24 11:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**de71**:	Yeah, similar thought process to me. Looking forward to seeing how my lines expand in the next few months!

**Retread**:	The bonuses seem to apply to each process separately.  My current efficiencies are 107 EXT, 152 SME and 100 BMP, but the BMPs haven't been running long enough to produce any experts yet.


[07-Feb-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	you have limit of 6 active experts per base


[07-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	so once you have 5 experts in metallurgy, you wont be able to have more than one in manufacturing


[07-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	just something to keep in mind


[07-Feb-24 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	That's true, but but that will be a limit no matter what.  It just becomes a matter of optimizing where those six experts are placed.


[07-Feb-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	What I mean, alternatively you could get another base somewhere else and specialize it in manufacturing


[07-Feb-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	preferably somewhere, where there are some natural resourced that also could be used in manufacturing


[07-Feb-24 12:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	the only problem is that logistics become harder to manage


[07-Feb-24 12:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	That is also true, but pretty far outside my scope right now.  So far I'm about a quarter of the way done to building out this base, and it will take weeks yet before I have the means to start considering a second base.  For now, it's enough to figure out how to bootstrap this one as efficiently as possible.  Multi-base production chains can wait.


[07-Feb-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	fair enough


[07-Feb-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	That's a question for the experienced hands out there: are there planets that have manufacturing COGC bonuses?  If there are, is there any space on them?


[07-Feb-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	those can be found using https://prunplanner.org/search


[07-Feb-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MoLab**:	How do I get the right blueprint for a Glas STL ship?


[08-Feb-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	There are some specs around but I do the following: Glass Based STL Engine, Small STL Fuel Tank Kit, Small Cargo Bay Kit, Lightweight Hull Plate


[08-Feb-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	If you plug those into a spec at a shipyard then it should tell you the parts that you need


[08-Feb-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I have to find out how this all works...


[08-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Why is Glass STL better? Fuel Saving STL seems like it would be a better bet, Glass has the same base fuel usage


[08-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, could be right, have to run some comparisons and figure it out


[08-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	How do I create the blueprint?


[08-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Cost of parts will be a factor too


[08-Feb-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	(I mean, I have no idea, genuinely asking!  I've only been playing for two weeks...)


[08-Feb-24 11:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Create some specs and then track down the parts on the CX or check in with one of the shipbuilding outfits


[08-Feb-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Ah I found it


[08-Feb-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Do you get unused parts "refunded" if you upgrade a blueprint?  If I upgraded a starter ship to a Glass STL with no FTL drive for in-system transport only, would I get the FTL drive back?


[08-Feb-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Unfortunately no


[08-Feb-24 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	Right, so a Glass STL might be a viable third ship, and upgrading starter ships to a larger cargo bay seems sensible?


[08-Feb-24 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	That's a solid plan


[08-Feb-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Erisea**:	(I am currently planning my second base, probably in a different system, so shipping is about to become a more important concern.)


[08-Feb-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Do I need a base at the shipyard?


[08-Feb-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I mean I cannot build the Glass STL ship at TO-392 where I have my base because it cannot jump FTL.


[08-Feb-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	exactly


[08-Feb-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	There is a shipyard at Pallada but I have no base there...


[08-Feb-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you have one problem more


[08-Feb-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	with last game update you cant to repair ships only on your bases. You have to repair it on a shipyards.


[08-Feb-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	so if your system havnt SHY - you havent repair of your stl ship


[08-Feb-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes, but MORIA has a shipyard, the question is just if I need to have a base at Pallada or if I can use the shipyard without a base there...


[08-Feb-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you can


[08-Feb-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Feb-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	yes, transfer between Vallis and Moria Station only


[08-Feb-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Actually I think it is better value for money to build a Glass STL ship for 1 million NCC than to upgrade starter ships to 1000/1000 for 735.000 NCC


[08-Feb-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

It's worth noting Moria Station and Vallis are pretty much the closest they can be right now so trips are very rapid, in... something like 4 weeks? trips will take ~24 hours for the same fuel one takes ~4 hours now

[09-Feb-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Where are the resources now?  In a rented warehouse space on the station?  If so, you can drag'n'drop between the warehouse and ship inventory screens.

[09-Feb-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	prunplanner.org is a great resource, but I have some quick spreadsheets I use as well and it looks like (if you're using flux) smelting FE is still profitable even with C at its current price


[09-Feb-24 11:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	not by a lot, but still


[09-Feb-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	making STL is also profitable at current rates


[09-Feb-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	(~64/hr profit for FE and ~85/hr for STL using VERY rough math that doesn't include efficiency factors)


[09-Feb-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	but setting up a second base to make C is really common, and I think there's at least one person who makes it here on Vallis as well? I can't remember if the numbers worked out for doing that or not


[10-Feb-24 12:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	producing STL also needs a lot of oxygen. Verdant is also a great location to get the oxygen.

[10-Feb-24 04:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	Though I'm gessing I have less FE production than other people who sell it directly, I mostly feed iron into other production to get more money per FE produced

**Fero**:	Wait spiotwo


[10-Feb-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	You have HCP GRN burning?


[10-Feb-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	Why?


[10-Feb-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	Just by grain it should be enough


[10-Feb-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	Granted you need more incinerators for the smelters then


[10-Feb-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	4SME requires ~9.84 per day to keep running, 2INC running HCP GRN together produce ~11.8C per day


[10-Feb-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	My point being that just by grain you get around four batches of carbon in 3 weeks


[10-Feb-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	And that 60 FE requires 1 week


[10-Feb-24 05:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	So in total 1 inc burning JUST grain could be enough to sustain 2 smelters WITHOUT the extra HCP


[10-Feb-24 05:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	1INC burning GRN produces 24C in 6 days 3h


[10-Feb-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	1 inc burning GRN should produce 80 in around 24 days


[10-Feb-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	And for me 60 FE produces in 10 days


[10-Feb-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Fero**:	It still works


[10-Feb-24 05:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-24 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-24 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	I am governor of TO-392 - Sabaton. Feel free to ask questions...


[10-Feb-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	MoLab, how much do you think it costs to survive on planets like Sabaton?


[10-Feb-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Say, per day?


[10-Feb-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	What happens if I can't manage to provide the needed supplies to let people work on that planet, is it just a production halt or is it possible to lose your workforce?


[10-Feb-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	You have per building additional repair costs of 1 HSE and some INS. An EXT building after 50 days has 1 HSE and 66 INS. If you repair after 90 days it is still 1 HSE and some more INS.

[10-Feb-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	And is it worthwhile for the good resources on the planet/


[10-Feb-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	?


[10-Feb-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	1 HSE is at about 11,7k NCC, INS is at about 150 NCC.


[10-Feb-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	It's a one time cost?


[10-Feb-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	That makes more sense


[10-Feb-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	No HSE and INS are needed with every repairment.


[10-Feb-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Hey Molab, thanks for taking questions! What is the base output of EXTs extracting FEO, CLI and LST on Sabaton?


[10-Feb-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	You also need them to build your base. But it is worth it for the pioneer extractors. You can also build some settlers buildings if necessary. Other pops are not developed yet.

[10-Feb-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Feb-24 03:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Feb-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	@Simon - yes,diversifying is a good thing - also making higher level things, if you make STL, youcan then build an FS and use that to turn the STL -> MFK. (etc.)

**Woqxifh**:	well, PRUNplanner also has ROI, I was rather asking "how many days is a good ROI"? Should I build a base if the ROI is 30 days, or should I spend more time looking for another design with a smaller ROI?

[15-Feb-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

**SimonBaltzerberg**:	I read some people had 8+ SME, how do you approach managing the production queue?


[15-Feb-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	Do you have like 2 day long production orders that end on different days?


[15-Feb-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	smaller scale than 8 smelters, but i have four, and the goal is to smelt all smelted iron to steel.  I figured out that to do that, I need 1.9 smelting iron and 2.1 smelting steel.


[15-Feb-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	Yeah, my question is how to manage production queue when you have fewer spots in the queue than numer of Smelters :)


[15-Feb-24 11:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Right now, I'm approximating that ratio by having recurring orders of 1 FE to 2 STL, which gives me 2.28 FE and 1.72 ST.  Long term, once I build up enough inventory, I'll switch to 5 steel to 3 iron, which works out to 1.94 FE to 2.06 STL.


[15-Feb-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It's all about getting the ratios of time right, if you can.  Then you only need one recurring order for each product.


[15-Feb-24 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The downside is you have to carry enough inventory to be able to handle the longer production cycles.


[15-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	What I do with 5 smelters is i just make 5 FE orders, and then 5 double STL orders


[15-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	then I end up with 0 FE


[15-Feb-24 11:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	and start new cycle


[15-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	actually i do double FE and quadruple STL


[15-Feb-24 11:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	so that each production takes almost 24h, so that i don't have to click too often


[15-Feb-24 11:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	but I don't have pro so i don't have recurring orders, which makes me think i won't be able to handle more than 5 SME


[15-Feb-24 11:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i have 12 SME. 6x2 pack 30mins apart 16-24hrs orders. alternating what i need sometimes STL AL SI.

**FireBeyond**:	Not sure whether to be disappointed, or glad I didn't easy mode the game. Just a lowly noob, squeezing out a few thousand here and there. And then I spotted four buy orders on a CX for 1 CA at 10M each. Three days old. I raced to throw up a chemical plant finding no calcium nearby, and was about twenty minutes from grinding out my first output when someone scooped them up.


[15-Feb-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Feb-24 02:39 PM] ApexChat#8127

**AinzOoalGown**:	Im currently at 465 / 35 / 500


[18-Feb-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	On your BS buffor you can "ADD" permits


[18-Feb-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	and to get more permits you have to upgrade your HQ


[18-Feb-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Each additional permit only adds 250 space - so it isn't a bad thing to do while 'small" - but when you start a new base on a different planet you get 500 (minus 25) for each permit - so you get more bang for your buck by adding new planets.


[18-Feb-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Also, you can only get up to 1000 space on one planet

**Retread**:	Need to add the code for your specific base (e.g. WF 12abc34d).  Easier to just bring up your base overview (BS OT-580c for Vallis) and click on workforce from there.

**BrokenMayo**:	Steel production at moria doesn't seem worth it at all


[20-Feb-24 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I can sell two iron for roughly 1200


[20-Feb-24 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Steel costs two iron in production, needs 8 units of oxygen which makes it a loss in profits


[20-Feb-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	That's without considering the time it takes to product steel and the additional workforce necessities you need to spend to transport it


[20-Feb-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Am I missing something about steel?


[20-Feb-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Let me look


[20-Feb-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ok, so 2 FE plus 8 O equals 2 STL


[20-Feb-24 05:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I'm planning on moving over to sabaton and using my iron for construction anyway but just wondering yano


[20-Feb-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	2 STL is 2800 on the CX, and 8 O is about 800 and 2 FE is about 1100


[20-Feb-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Ah I'm a clown ye


[20-Feb-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	You get 2 stl not 1


[20-Feb-24 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	So 2800 worth of STL from 1900 of FE and O


[20-Feb-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	np, it can be easy to lose track of things in this game


[20-Feb-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Just another quick question, do you need to pay base construction materials all at once when base building?


[20-Feb-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yep


[20-Feb-24 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Do the starter ships with 500t and 500m^3 have issues carrying the entire load?


[20-Feb-24 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	If you're able to tell me that it'll save me some maths


[20-Feb-24 05:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Max starters carry is 63 FE or 63 STL each time


[20-Feb-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Ye I know but I'm wondering if the load would carry the base building materials


[20-Feb-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Or would I need to upgrade a ship


[20-Feb-24 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Or build a new one


[20-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can spreadsheet it yourself


[20-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Better to do that than rely on us


[20-Feb-24 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	I can yeah


[20-Feb-24 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	Have done a lot of spreadsheeting so far mate


[20-Feb-24 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**BrokenMayo**:	No need to be so cheeky at a simple question


[20-Feb-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Well we dont have enough info to answer your question, what are you building and what building mats are you using? If its enough for a couple more smelters your ship can handle it


[20-Feb-24 09:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	if its a brand new base with consumables too you’ll probably have to take a couple trips

**Sparepaper894**:	Anyone know how to severly cut expenses?


[22-Feb-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	A few things I'd check: 1) are you making unnecessary trips?  In the beginning, limit your flights to when you need to buy supplies or when you have a full cargo hold of saleable goods.  2) are you taking unprofitable faction contracts?  Not all of them will make you money, the planetary survey ones especially rarely do.  3) Have you done the math on your profitability?  Not every production chain makes money, gotta make things that sell for more than they cost to produce and ship.

**DYSIODE**:	Keep in mind the vast majority of your costs are your workforce, and as you produce more goods fuel costs will become a much smaller part of your costs. I use www.prunplanner.org to get a good estimate of what to produce (you do have to make sure there's a market for some of it!), but there's other tools to explore that as well: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/community-resources/index.html

**Retread**:	Interesting observation about workforce costs, it must vary a lot by industry.  My expenses for the last period were 57% materials, 28% worker supplies, 5% fuel and 5% depreciation of buildings.  The rest were under 3%.


[22-Feb-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I double checked, and my materials and worker supplies are roughly equal, though I'm not sure if materials is only purchased. I'm mostly running a pioneer metallurgy industry + PP1s I'm mining my own LST for now, but I do buy a lot of AL


[22-Feb-24 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I'm a metallurgist like you, but produce primarily FE>STL>PT.  Most of my material costs are O and C for smelting FE and STL and then TRN to make PT


[22-Feb-24 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	oh, interesting, I completely eschewed the BMP because it wasn't metallurgy and didn't produce anything I needed (other than MCG but that's inexpensive) but looking again... I can definitely see a place for it. Still, my Welding Plants have served me well despite the high AL cost

**DYSIODE**:	Vallis produces such little O it's definitely better to just buy it and use the workers for pretty much anything else. Prunplanner says each COL only makes ~430ncc per day


[24-Feb-24 08:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	(meaning that's all you're saving by having one)


[24-Feb-24 08:13 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-24 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	I use PRUN to help me manage my resources

[25-Feb-24 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Use FIO in Chrome for API


[25-Feb-24 05:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	mm, i'm aware of prunplanner - but the price of carbon seems kinda just not worth it


[25-Feb-24 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	my current approach is to buy GRN.NC1 and HCP.NC1 in an incinerator, but i'm wondering if that's just a waste of workforce


[25-Feb-24 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	uh, and use them in an inc*


[25-Feb-24 05:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Carbon is expensive, but needed


[25-Feb-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	At some point I will branch out and build a carbon and Oxygen base


[25-Feb-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	if i did the maths right i'm halving my C.NC1 costs by doing this, even including the production costs


[25-Feb-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	help minimise cost, but for now I buy O and C


[25-Feb-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	but i wonder if my workforce could be doing something else


[25-Feb-24 05:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Max out satisfaction


[25-Feb-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	do basic and lux to make production time faster


[25-Feb-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	now that i'd love to do, but unfortunately COF.NC1 is a little bit pricey atm


[25-Feb-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Keep in mind the shipping needed before going into that plan.


[25-Feb-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Work towards that


[25-Feb-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yeah shipping and fuel costs


[25-Feb-24 05:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You'll need Agri products to feed the INC, and C isn't exactly light


[25-Feb-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	well, i'm not trying to sell the C


[25-Feb-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	just trying to cut down on the cost of FE smelting


[25-Feb-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You'll need to move it here. Well, either that or the Agri products here


[25-Feb-24 05:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	yeah, the agri products are what i'm moving


[25-Feb-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd suggest another plan - turning your FE into higher value products like basic prefabs


[25-Feb-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	i'm doing that too, my final output is BBH


[25-Feb-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	atm


[25-Feb-24 05:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	just wondering if the buy agri -> INC plan is inherently a bad idea


[25-Feb-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Why not import C from HRT instead?


[25-Feb-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	hm, i haven't actually looked at stations outside moria yet


[25-Feb-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	C.IC1


[25-Feb-24 05:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	oh, right


[25-Feb-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	i don't have a pro licence, so buying in ICA doesn't really work for me quite yet


[25-Feb-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Isn't that much cheaper right now though


[25-Feb-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You could bring your BBHs there, sell for ICAs, and return with C


[25-Feb-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	... you have a point


[25-Feb-24 05:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	BBH.IC1


[25-Feb-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	idk it doesn't look that much better


[25-Feb-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	considering the FTL costs involved


[25-Feb-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	That's because the prices in MOR are inflated right now


[25-Feb-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can keep this plan in mind while monitoring the price changes


[25-Feb-24 05:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You should also check out BEN


[25-Feb-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	ok, so i guess i'll stockpile BBH, stick with the INC for now, and keep an eye on the prices. seems like a decent idea


[25-Feb-24 05:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	GRN.IC1 vs GRN.NC1


[25-Feb-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	!!!


[25-Feb-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	ok now it's looking better


[25-Feb-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Plenty of ideas but they change as the prices fluctuate :)


[25-Feb-24 05:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127

[25-Feb-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

**dakota1234**:	"no capacity" generally means your base storage is full


[25-Feb-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	for now you can move some stuff to your ship(s) to store it, or rent a warehouse unit with WAR OT-580c

**WhiteFox**:	Hello, I am on Moria Vallis and I need Limestone, is the Planet Montem good for Mining Limestone or not? And what do I need to do then, do I need a extra base or can I just build there?


[26-Feb-24 05:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**WhiteFox**:	Thanks


[26-Feb-24 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scottyy**:	Under HQ you will see the # of base permits you have.  If you have one available you can build.


[26-Feb-24 05:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scottyy**:	If you go to Montem's planet details, you will see how well it produces limestone (compare it to other planets).  You can click 'START BASE' to see the materials you need.


[26-Feb-24 05:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Scottyy**:	Just load up a ship with those materials and you can complete the process.


[26-Feb-24 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	keep in mind, that Montem also is a starter planet, so its no place for base immediatelly \o/

**Retread**:	Experts improve the efficiency of your buildings by a small percentage.  As you use buildings in particular categories (eg metallurgy, manufacturing), you accumulate experts; up to five per building category.  The trick is, you can only have six total experts active on your base at any given time, so once more than six experts have arrived at your base, you have to begin choosing which ones to activate.


[26-Feb-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sparepaper894**:	Ah, thank you.


[26-Feb-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	For example, I'm still fairly new, so I have 3 experts in each of Resource Extraction, Metallurgy and Manufacturing available, for a total of nine.  But I can only use six, so I've chosen (with the help of a spreadsheet to calculate the effect on my profitability) to use three experts each in Metallurgy and Manufacturing and let the three Resource Extraction experts sit idle.

[26-Feb-24 08:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Luxuries make your pops more efficient.  They only produce at 100% speed when they have access to all of their consumables, basic and luxury


[26-Feb-24 08:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sparepaper894**:	Hmm, I haven't really noticed that. Thank you for the info!


[26-Feb-24 08:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The new order window will tell you all the efficiency factors, e.g. Pioneers, Production Line Condition, Experts, CoGC Program,


[26-Feb-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	if the Pioneers (or Settlers, etc...) is less than 100%, they don't have access to all of their consumables.


[26-Feb-24 08:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sparepaper894**:	hmm, good to know. I'll add that to my information document


[26-Feb-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	You could also go to your base screen (BS OT-580c for Vallis), and then click on Workforce for a more detailed breakdown


[26-Feb-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sparepaper894**:	I have the workforce window set open all the time but it doesn't really explain much to me, just abunch of technical jargen.


[26-Feb-24 08:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Let's just look in the pioneers column.  Each cell in that column represents the needs of your pioneers for that resource.


[26-Feb-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sparepaper894**:	And from what i've been seeing it scales up per production building you have, or so I think. My COF went from 0.6/day to 0.8/day after i've made a collector to help me save on some costs for making Iron.


[26-Feb-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	For example, in the DW row, it tells me that my Pioneers need 48.8 units of drinking water per day, and that their need is 100% satisfied.


[26-Feb-24 08:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	See the "Total" Column?  That how much of each resource you need each day to supply your workforce.


[26-Feb-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	when you add more buildings, they need more workforce, which needs more supplies.


[26-Feb-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sparepaper894**:	Ok, now I think im starting to understand it now, thank you very much!


[26-Feb-24 08:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	NP


[26-Feb-24 08:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	As you build more production buildings, you'll also need to build more housing for your workforce


[26-Feb-24 08:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sparepaper894**:	Hmm, I was thinking so. Guess anytime I add a new building I'll need to update my charts / lists I have on another tab.


[26-Feb-24 08:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DYSIODE**:	Don't forget you can use a base permit to grant more space to your base (I've had a second base for some time now, so I'm not arguing against that, just mentioning it as an option :)


[02-Mar-24 05:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	It's worth it in my mind to add at least a few PP1s in to your mix too, selling prefabs is always profitable and then you can save up most of what you need for a new base

**WhiteFox**:	Hello, I would like to get Apex Premium soon and wanted to ask here if someone can help me a little financially. I'm slowly running out of money, because the costs to keep the workers working are pretty high and the fuel costs aren't exactly low for me either. So my question is whether someone who is much better off financially can buy resources from me at a high price or sell me fuel and other important resources to keep production going at a lower price. Thanks in advance.

**MoLab**:	Hello everyone, I want to encourage you to have a look at Sabaton (TO-392d). I am governor of this planet and it has rich resources of FEO, LST and CLI. Currently this place is also interesting for people who want to found fully developed bases as we have about 4000 pioneers and 1200 settlers available for your jobs which is a lot for an uninhabitable planet. Feel free to ask questions if you are unsure about Sabaton.


[14-Mar-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Benjamin_Drauger**:	so you want us to establish bases on there? invest into it?


[14-Mar-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Mar-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	That is great to know. I always wanted to settle on Montem for Chemistry but Montem is hard to catch a free area. That alternative in TO-392 is a great idea.

**DYSIODE**:	The catch is they require INS.NC1 and HSE (though that may just be the CM) to build on making them significantly more expensive to bootstrap


[14-Mar-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	the CM alone needs 250 INS, or ~42,000 NCC


[14-Mar-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	Thanks Vector


[14-Mar-24 04:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CaineUWU**:	For pop growth to happen you need to have their desired fulfillments above a specified level. Amounts below the min will cause migration and above the upper limit will attract new workers.


[14-Mar-24 04:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CaineUWU**:	There's no glaring issues with the planet atm tbh, the pop is large and I think we are losing pioneers and such because of the unemployment and not really the fulfillments being low


[14-Mar-24 04:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

I'm here working hard for 30, sometimes 40 minutes per day and they just kick back and chew my hard fought fat. Just rustles my jimmies I tell ya

**MoLab**:	In case of Sabaton those pioneers came there full of hope that they can contribute to something great, make the difference. Then all they could do was sitting around. So there were two kinds of pioneers, some started to drink alcohol until they get the service in the hospital, the others started to read books and educated themselves. We call them settlers. But also as settler they sit around and do not know what to do. I thought I will bring an end to that and talk to you business people so you could make the difference.

[17-Mar-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It's for all 9, should be the same as the ask price on the CX.  Saves us both the shipping.


[17-Mar-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**cerebrate117**:	Highest ask I see at station is 530 per FE, so 9 is like 4700 total I think

[17-Mar-24 03:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Age-Kahn**:	You can absolutely get loans and choosing to wait or not is entirely up to you, but most everyone with experience in the game would probably recommend getting a loan to boost your company early game.


[17-Mar-24 03:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**FireBeyond**:	Definitely look for a loan. 100K was enough for me to get me over a hump of eeking out maybe 1-2,000 a day, basically keeping even with fuel and supplies (and sometimes barely that, because you have a hard time biulding up a lump sum of consumables to minimize trips to the CX)...


[18-Mar-24 11:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireBeyond**:	to getting a few more buildings up, some supplies, and within days be making 15-20K a day

[18-Mar-24 08:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	That's how many you used from the available workforce pool this cycle (week)


[18-Mar-24 08:26 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Magna-Ritano**:	local mrket blocked by pro license is so stupid. This is killing the game. Instead  to trade immediately you need to wait long hours if not days to buy and sell stuff


[21-Mar-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Or you can sell at the posted price people are bidding on the market, tho that does cut into your profit margins


[21-Mar-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Its also an attempt to stop orders like the one on Moria CX rn for RATs at well under market value, noone accept that its a bad move


[21-Mar-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CaineUWU**:	The local market is vulnerable, the CX does not have the same issue


[21-Mar-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Mar-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DYSIODE**:	Killing the game? The game IS flying your ships hours back and forth to trade with the CX. Local Markets are local to the planet you're on, and depend heavily on people using them, but I've never felt the need to except when I forget MCG and want it -now- or someone posts a good deal


[21-Mar-24 04:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Isoroku**:	Normally I would say Danakil, but with C prices would probably do Verdant. As a bonus you could produce everything you need for your base on Vallis so you can focus on SME


[23-Mar-24 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	2 COL on Verdant would even let you smelt the FE on Vallis into STL before exporting it

**Benjamin_Drauger**:	*gasp* fuck, IIIII neeeeeedddddd itttttt


[23-Mar-24 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Alternatively you could go to Sabaton (one jump north of Montem) and get a second FEO/LST/CLI base - only problem is you need HSE/INS - so it isn't a cheap base to start.

[23-Mar-24 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Almost anytime you make stuff yourself it will be cheaper then buying it on the market, so the real decision point should be what do you want to specialize in?  Carbon is definitely a great market to get into, great demand.


[23-Mar-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	But you are on Vallis - which has low fertility and a COGC of Metallurgy, so for now it probably makes sense to focus on smelting metals until you save enough to start expanding to a new base.

[24-Mar-24 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DYSIODE**:	It's also worth investing in a PP1 or two to start too, the limestone can be a bit expensive at first, but the ROI is really good and then you can start building up a stockpile of prefabs you can use for yourself


[24-Mar-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Ok PP1 looks good. But what's ROI?


[24-Mar-24 01:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Btw having extractor might be great too.


[24-Mar-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[24-Mar-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	I'm offering cheaper ship upgrades for players <180d old who would like to upgrade your starter ships to WCBs (3kt/1km3 capacity). You can DM me for details, or head over to the UFO Discord post (Under Galactic Deals).


[26-Mar-24 10:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	My buildings in total require more workers that what I currently have.. For this the efficiency has decreased. Can I change the efficiency of any particular building?? And how can I get more pioneers?


[26-Mar-24 10:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Btw, what happens if I have more pioneers than my habitat capacity?


[26-Mar-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	You'll either need to build more HAB's, or wait until the next planet population report (POPR).


[26-Mar-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	How do I know when the next POPR will happen?


[26-Mar-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	if you have more PIO's than your HAB's allow, they'll just go back into the planet pool next POPR - they won't cost you any more


[26-Mar-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	uh oh.. I guess I need to build a habitat asap


[26-Mar-24 10:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	You can find it on the top of the planet info screen, or 'POPR OT-580c' in a buffer


[26-Mar-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Being a little under on pops won't hurt you much, for example a single percent workforce loss isn't that bad if it lets you fit your base that you need.


[26-Mar-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Ok got it looks like every week it happens


[26-Mar-24 10:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	But thats more for a complete base


[26-Mar-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	I require 240 pioneers but I have space for 200


[26-Mar-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah POPR is every 7 days, next Vallis is in 15h 24m


[26-Mar-24 10:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Definitely time to get a new HAB then :)


[26-Mar-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	well it's not impossible but it will require a lot of money and a lot of fuel.. And I just made PP1 to get construction prefabs and save a ton of money... I guess it's better to build habitat next week.

[27-Mar-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[27-Mar-24 02:10 PM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Mar-24 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It depends on whether you can handle the "shock" of the suddenly-expanded logistics requirements, especially since you're on FREE and cannot upgrade your ships.


[29-Mar-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Could be better to do it in more manageable stages, and that means you only need to stock enough prefabs for each phase

[29-Mar-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I did the phased approach for my Carbon base, but I was stockpiling base parts for a while too and/or using them to expand the base here


[29-Mar-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	yes that's why I am trying to keep the idea of a second base at hold for now.. I literally struggling to make a new habitat.. I guess I will wait for some time.


[29-Mar-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	For some perspective I didn't spin up my second base until around day 60 on my account


[29-Mar-24 09:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	The pp1 helps me get all the parts next I am thinking of making a BMP, that waiy I won't have to buy those stuff.


[29-Mar-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The second base is usually the most challenging as the increased logistics really changes the way you play the game


[29-Mar-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Okk.. I was wondering when is the best time to start a second base.


[29-Mar-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's made worse if the second base is not in the same system, which it will likely not be if you start on Vallis


[29-Mar-24 09:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I had 3-4 PP1s when I expanded too, there's a LOT of runway on Vallis


[29-Mar-24 09:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	I made the jump to Proxion, it's... been fine, I just have 1200 LST idling since I don't want to pay a quarter of it's value in shipping costs lol


[29-Mar-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You could sell it on the Proxion LM


[29-Mar-24 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Mar-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Mar-24 09:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	They make a convenient pair - extract FEO on OZ-189a, extract ALO and smelt AL/FE on OF-375b, turn everything into prefabs on OF-375c


[29-Mar-24 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can also make a chemistry base on OZ-189c and maximise the LST/HAL you can extract on OZ-189a


[29-Mar-24 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	That would be quite the trip between OZ and OF, but I do want a Chem base at some point, and a whole ass Construction base would be nice too


[29-Mar-24 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	The 2 systems are beside each other

[29-Mar-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	If you're on Vallis, a collector will not give you enough oxygen to be worthwhile.  Nor is Vallis able to sustain any agriculture.  Your best bet for now is to buy the carbon you need, build out your metallurgy base, and then set up a base elsewhere.

**Logee**:	how do I get more pioneers? For instance, If I want to add another extractor, ill need more pioneers


[29-Mar-24 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	build another HB1, they gotta have a place to live.  Remember to buy provisions for them too, more pioneers = more supplies needed.


[29-Mar-24 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

**NgURoyalZ**:	for any ppl on vallis who already have a 2nd (or more) base. how much did you spend in terms of hard cash ? im trying to get a ballpark


[30-Mar-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	to set up a second base?  I just finished my second base on Verdant, Prunplanner says its worth about 850k.


[30-Mar-24 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Built in in four (I think) stages.  Cost is going to vary a lot by what you build and what planet you build it on.

**NgURoyalZ**:	and im aiming at the usual C and O production


[30-Mar-24 10:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	but first i think i will have to expand this one to 2 ext 8 sme


[30-Mar-24 10:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Logee**:	so 1 ext can support 4 sme? Im still learning ratios and such


[30-Mar-24 10:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	for steel yes


[30-Mar-24 10:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	iron is 1 ext 2 sme


[30-Mar-24 10:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	with a little iron overproduction when u use all the ore. but u can slap a pp1 into the mix and use that iron for prefabs

**Retread**:	and then there's experts...


[30-Mar-24 10:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	oh boi


[30-Mar-24 11:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Point being, there are very few exact or constant ratios


[30-Mar-24 11:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	yeah sure but for steel 1 ext 4 sme is the basic setupo if im not mistaken


[30-Mar-24 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	no, you're exactly right about that, and for someone just starting out that's all they need to build out a Vallis base, for now.  Just wanted to leave an asterisk next to that thought that things can get more tweakable/complex later on


[30-Mar-24 11:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	on that note. after going for 1 ext 4 smelters should i double or get some metallist studios going?


[30-Mar-24 11:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Logee**:	Are you doing 1 iron ext, 1 iron sme, and 2 steel sme's?


[30-Mar-24 11:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Logee**:	nm, thats 3


[30-Mar-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	2 ext on vallis can get you pretty far, I think I had its 3 ext to 12 sme before I made an aluminum mining base out in WB-947


[30-Mar-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	now im working on getting more smelters on Vallis while retiring my extractors and collectors


[30-Mar-24 11:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	thinking a Construction and Manufacturing hub on Dokkebi?


[30-Mar-24 11:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Logee**:	Im running a single oxygen collector on Vallis with my extractor and sme, not sure collector is worth it here though. It does offset the oxygen cost for the first sme for sure though, just dont think itll last long


[30-Mar-24 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	My Vallis base is 2 EXT, 8 SME, 7 BMP, 1 FS and 1 PP1.  I think you can make more money off the 15 area the collector takes up by using it for something else than you save by not having to buy that O.


[30-Mar-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Well right now I have only 1 smelter so I always have extra oxygen lying around from collector.. Having collector helps in early game but when you have a lot of smelters, you can just destroy your collector and get it somewhere else


[30-Mar-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Also with high oxygen prices it's not easy buying so much oxygen.


[30-Mar-24 12:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	I agree that only 3 units of oxygen in 11hrs is not worth. But it's just enough to save some money early game.


[30-Mar-24 12:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	You should of course play the game however you want, but for the price of the collector you can buy about 165 oxygen -  25 days of production of that collector.


[30-Mar-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	yeah true.. Actually I kind of got those parts from contract and it was the only thing I could make back then so I just made it.. Anyway, now that I have PP1 these parts are super cheap.


[30-Mar-24 12:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	After I place a trade and no one buys it, can I take it off the market?


[30-Mar-24 12:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Mar-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I started off just doing PT, but those crashed hard and I learned something about diversification.  The BMPs do REP, PE, EXO, OVE and PT, with some MCG thrown in when I need it.


[30-Mar-24 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Mar-24 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**UnitZero**:	Id love to have something like 5 minute undocking sequence where you can still abort the flight.


[30-Mar-24 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	You do.  It takes about 5 mins to take off, if you abort the flight in that time, the ship will return to origin.  More details: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/tutorials/legacy-tutorials/space-flight/#2-moving-ships

**Broot**:	If you can find a way for something to work for you though, do what you want. Right now I produce only MCG here on vallis, where there is neither LST or SIO and I'm doing well. Only the basic ships but I have 5 buildings producing enough to keep my ships busy and make a good profit, even when the market prices aren't the best I'm still making money


[02-Apr-24 06:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	Last universe I was spread all over, and it was also lots of fun. Made a lot more money but I also had to check in on things very often. This was before you could get new ships so I relied heavily on others to ship my goods so I always always on to make sure my contracts were fulfilled

**Novachrono28**:	How do you get additional ships?


[02-Apr-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Greg_Doe**:	Hi Ravick, in the youtube video of space empire, they talk about multiple verticals of productions, do you know where those schematics are, i wanted to consult them and did not found them in th ewiki


[04-Apr-24 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	If you are asking about the starting professions, then you can find them on the Wiki under tutorials.  Let me know if that helps.


[04-Apr-24 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	no its the afterward, i got iron ore and iron going but then... going into what next


[04-Apr-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	also asked in help channels


[04-Apr-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Ah, got it.  I think that part is really up to you.  All the questions about what to do next are pretty open, so you need to think through / work through what you want to do.


[04-Apr-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	i wanted to analyse that today, the schematics in those video look like i could actually base myself

[04-Apr-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Those can help you plan out your next moves


[04-Apr-24 08:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	yeah found that yesterday but some of them dont talk to me much as explaination what they do


[04-Apr-24 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	They basically project your bases needs and production and potential income / expenses


[04-Apr-24 09:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	So you would start by entering in your current base set-up and then you can model scenarios


[04-Apr-24 09:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I think your more basic question is more like - I'm making iron, now what do I do with it - well, that depends


[04-Apr-24 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Iron is used primarily in making STL or BSE, BBH, BTA or you can just sell the Iron


[04-Apr-24 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I'd suggest that you model some scenarios and choose a path forward.  Also it's very easy to tear down buildings and build new things, so don't worry so much about small mistakes or changing course in the future.


[04-Apr-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	Ok, curently mining and switching from iron to steel at the smelter bu tthen the video implies going forward and go for sub-specialisation


[04-Apr-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	You should come to your own conclusion about what to do next


[04-Apr-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	that is why I wanted to understand and get a tool to actually know where to gofrom my base material production


[04-Apr-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	yup that is what I will do


[04-Apr-24 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Greg_Doe**:	Thanks Ravick


[04-Apr-24 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, use the base planners - np

**DYSIODE**:	There's certainly a lot to be said for not just following someone else's path, but I will say my early PP1s served me extremely well, they're a reliable income source and you can save some for yourself to naturally expand your production


[04-Apr-24 10:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	On the subject of forming your own conclusions, I happened to discover (with the help of PrunPlanner) GCs had an extremely high profit margin, like 4-5x so I invested into that. It's since gone away and I've turned to making HMS from them myself, but it's a good example of where exploration can take you


[04-Apr-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	the glory days of GCs were so good


[04-Apr-24 11:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	unfortunately a lot of people noticed and now they're sorta regularly profitable rather than a money printer

**Spiotwo**:	Based on technician population the entire Moria region needs only about 300GC per day, and I make 240 per day...


[04-Apr-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	Actually I don't understand how there are still a lot of products with a consistent profit margin. Surely with how many players there are every product's price would have settled on the raw material cost + worker upkeep?


[04-Apr-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Senlis**:	I am using PRUNplanner and attempting to incorperate FIO into it.  I installed the Firefox extension, but I can't figure out how to create a FIO account.  Could someone help me with that?

[05-Apr-24 04:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	also, travel times are variable and travel means are limited


[05-Apr-24 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Senlis**:	I'm relatively new, but I'm guessing that with new players making basic resources, there are more advanced players consuming those resources and keeping demand up.  When a resource's proft margin drops to near 0, then people will move their industry to another product that has a higher demand and therefore a higher profit margin.  I'm only a couple days in and have already moved from making FE to CU because it has a higher profit margin.


[05-Apr-24 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	So you buy everything needed for CU?

[05-Apr-24 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Linski**:	That's what I did with my Refinery start. Skipped the extractors/collectors and imported AMM, GAL and H. Might not work with every product since you could lose a bit too much money flying back and forth.


[05-Apr-24 10:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Senlis**:	@Novachrono28 I buy CUO and SIO to make CU.  I produce some of the O I need, about half.  When I get to two bases, I might move those to a planet better suited for it


[05-Apr-24 11:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	An interesting strategy indeed


[05-Apr-24 12:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I was skeptical, but making CU and importing the inputs is actually much closer in profitability to making STL from scratch than I thought.  I built a couple of test Vallis bases in prunplanner, one with 6 HB1, 2 EXT and 9 SME, smelting as much of the FEO to STL as I could.  Daily Profit of about 16k.


[05-Apr-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The CU base consists of 6 HB1 and 12 SME, and has almost the identical area.  All the smelters do is churn out CU.  That base makes 15k a day.


[05-Apr-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	oh sorry.  I screwed up and misclicked AL instead of CU.

***FrankFrak** left.*


[05-Apr-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Holy crap.  Making CU in that base instead of AL will net you 28k per day.


[05-Apr-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The downside is, you have to haul in all of the raw materials, and you have to make two trips per day with a starter ship to keep the hoppers full.


[05-Apr-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	that is a ton of hauling


[05-Apr-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-24 03:58 PM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Apr-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	and the CU market is ready to handle 12 SMEs worth haha

***LeonOwO** left.*


[05-Apr-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Also keep in mind O.NC1 is quite high, it jumps the unit cost of STL by ~35% over it's historical average


[05-Apr-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	But if you're willing to do some cross CX trading, you could turn STL into MFK.CI1, then buy O.CI1 and bring that back (nevermind that you need Settlers to run an FS) so there's still an opportunity to use the STL too


[05-Apr-24 04:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	STL used to be great for PT.


[05-Apr-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	(though, the unit volume on MFKs at CI1 is pretty low)


[05-Apr-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Sorry.  STL.NC1 used to be great for PT.NC1


[05-Apr-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	oh, you don't have to add the markets, I was just doing it to contrast the prices to what's going on here


[05-Apr-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	lol, I like adding the markets.  It just takes me a minute to transition from the real world.


[05-Apr-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The whole strategy of buying all of your inputs is something to keep in mind though.  I built a bunch of BMPs to produce PT initially, but when then that crashed I found other things for them to do.  BMPs are very flexible that way.  I make more by turning H and C into PE right now than I do off STL.


[05-Apr-24 04:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Half of what I'm selling now is leftovers from my own inputs, like PTs and REPs for Settlers, I'm swamped enough in MFK and SFKs that I'm making UTSs to slow them done, I added MHLs to slow down my GC production, and I at least do expect to use the INS I'm producing, but I still sell a lot of it


[05-Apr-24 04:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	and I use the HMS that the GCs turn into, but it's still a major sale item for me (since the only Techs I have are for INS production)


[05-Apr-24 04:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	After how many days of playtime do you get your ratings?


[05-Apr-24 04:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	You need to have a PRO/Basic license to get a rating (they don't make that very clear in the UI)


[05-Apr-24 04:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	I thought the ratings are based on the number of contracts fulfilled in a given time.


[05-Apr-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	They are, but the only way to accept non-faction contracts is with a Pro license


[05-Apr-24 04:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	If you get PRO your faction contracts do count toward the rating, but without PRO having a rating doesn't make sense


[05-Apr-24 04:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Oh I see.. Without PRO you are kind of alone


[05-Apr-24 04:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	You can only help or be helped by friends when you are PRO


[05-Apr-24 05:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	To an extent, yes, but if you let the PRO license expire you get the Basic license and can still do some contract related things. https://prosperousuniverse.com/premium has the differences,

**HM892**:	that might all change when if/when i ramp up production though, my main problem rn is actually a good source of ALO.NC1 for building things in a PP2


[09-Apr-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	i've been buying it so far to give me a stock for when i bite the bullet and build the PP2 but i'd like to settle somewhere slightly more self-sufficient when it comes to plastics and ALO


[09-Apr-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	I had 4 COLs on Vallis but they werent producing much, why I thought I wud set up on Verdant.


[09-Apr-24 07:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	yeah i guess it's enough for 2 smelters but probably not when you have a dozen or so lol


[09-Apr-24 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	like i only have one COL and it keeps both smelters overfed


[09-Apr-24 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yea I have 15 Smelters running and 7 PP1


[09-Apr-24 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	that'll do it then


[09-Apr-24 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	:P


[09-Apr-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	i've been branching into welding too, but i'm starting to think the HE.NC1 cost might not be worth it


[09-Apr-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yeah think guna send a ship off to Verdant and setup there for O and C.


[09-Apr-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Never looked into the Welding side


[09-Apr-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Seemed to make sense to do prefabs, as everyone needs them


[09-Apr-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	my currently pipeline barely makes money, I.NC1 + FE.NC1 + HE.NC1 = MHL.NC1 (but of course i don't pay nearly as much for the FE)


[09-Apr-24 07:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	but money it does make


[09-Apr-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	and yeah always got a surplus of basic prefabs to sell off at one point or another


[09-Apr-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Selling BBH, and BDE is profitable, aswell as selling excess STL


[09-Apr-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	BDEs are annoying to make because of the PE requirement, so i try to only make the ones i need for buildings


[09-Apr-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	but BBH is super easy


[09-Apr-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	BDE.NC1 PE.NC1


[09-Apr-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	True, but the PE is quite cheap. BBH is the main one tho


[09-Apr-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	so that's, what, 1.5k per BDE


[09-Apr-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	compared to BBH.NC1 LST.NC1 (ignore FE because it's basically free on Valiis)


[09-Apr-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	huge profits


[09-Apr-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	yeah very true. currently producing BDEs for expansion so wont be selling next batch.


[09-Apr-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	including STL costs and production costs, you're probably looking at 2k/BBH


[09-Apr-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	and all because some people are too lazy to make their own x)


[09-Apr-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	haha yeah :P


[09-Apr-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	my most pressing problem is keeping the boys fed and watered


[09-Apr-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	gotta balance bulk-buying RAT and DW over whether i'll actually make the money back in the time it takes to consume them


[09-Apr-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	I use PRUN and FIO to mange it all, so I just do a big shop and load up for 7 days at a time


[09-Apr-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	yeah makes sense


[09-Apr-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	I need to save next for a ship upgrade so I can haul more O per trip


[09-Apr-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	i like to micro it a bit so each cycle for me is probably 2 or 3 days


[09-Apr-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	costs me more in STL and ship wear in the long run but i'm not trying to optimal, just profitable x)


[09-Apr-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**HM892**:	to be*


[09-Apr-24 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Maximan_X**:	Hello fellow Valis people, I'm new and only just built the recommended buildings for Metallurgist, what should be my game plan moving forward?


[09-Apr-24 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Dig up FEO, smelt it into FE.  Sell FE.  Figure out if you can turn FE into something more profitable (hint: STL).  Dig FEO, make FE, make STL, sell STL.  Build more extractors, build more smelters, figure out what else you can make with iron and steel that makes more money per day.  Fill out this base, build another, etc...

**DYSIODE**:	Welcome! Also Prefabs out of PP1 are never not in style, but yeah, there's a lot to get your bearings on so don't feel the need to rush (not that you can in a lot of ways, but MOR and Vallis are approaching their closest point so things won't take -as- long)


[09-Apr-24 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	You can also teardown buildings and get almost all the resources back, so retooling isn't a huge cost if you need to change it up


[09-Apr-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Senlis**:	So, if I wanted to get a loan to max out my current base and pay if off with the profits, it would cost a little under 1M.  Then, it would theoretically take 60 days to pay it off if I used all the profits from the production line, assuming there was no interest.  Am I missing something here, or is getting a large loan not the way to go here.


[09-Apr-24 11:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MoLab**:	Senlis I can offer you 30k at your business size for 2 months with 4% interest.

[09-Apr-24 11:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Apr-24 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	if youre smelting, by mining ore with an extractor then buying carbon from the market to smelt the ore into metal in a smeltar


[10-Apr-24 03:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	smelter*


[10-Apr-24 03:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	there are a set of tutorial guides on the main Base page that can help as well


[10-Apr-24 04:56 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Sir.Sirlington**:	I'm looking into producing STL instead of FE, it will require another Col I think which means another HB1, which means more DW, RAT, and OVE upkeep. Other route is to produce my own C and by extension more FE, both will need more Pioneer upkeep. I would just like some advice on which approach would be better in your experience?


[10-Apr-24 07:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	if u producing O in vallis i recommend instead buy it from CX and use area for another 2 SME.


[10-Apr-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	sry 1 SME


[10-Apr-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	i would recommend buying your own GRN/HCp and convert it to C yourself.


[10-Apr-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	when u get your base 500 and then expand. then in time u can specialize planets.


[10-Apr-24 07:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	eg on Verdant i produce agriculturals water and O moving them to Sand to produce RAT DW COF vs. likewise on Proxion also agriworld.


[10-Apr-24 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	the only consumables i cant produce what i need is KOM.


[10-Apr-24 07:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir.Sirlington**:	Okay I see, so you don't recommend I produce my own O? It is very cheap to be fair, C is more of the profit margin eater.


[10-Apr-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Sir.Sirlington**:	My thinking was STL takes a lot of O so I might as well produce at least some of it myself.


[10-Apr-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	in vallis 8 per day per collector. in verdant 31 per day per collector. u do the math.


[10-Apr-24 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	for O


[10-Apr-24 08:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	some planet better then verdant like Etherwind which get bonus to resource production. but too far away at the edge of universe like IZ-911c

**DYSIODE**:	According to prunplanner O is actually profitable on Vallis right now, but you also have to consider the upfront cost of building a COL and HB1 and what the opportunity cost there is. FEO has a ~20% higher daily profit for example

[12-Apr-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	money isn't really the slowdown to be honest, atleast in the beginning


[12-Apr-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Ah month old company? Im enjoying it now, just started a second base


[12-Apr-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Does slow down at times, but I like the gaps as I work alot


[12-Apr-24 12:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Ive only been playing about 5 month


[12-Apr-24 12:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Yeah funny enough I had more progress on my original company in 30 days than I do now, even after all the experience, I think its because I'm actively trying not to burn out and get over PU


[12-Apr-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yeah I started off really slow, as didnt want to commit to much as resources and money was scarce lol but now cash kind flows ok, not rich, but keeps production going


[12-Apr-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Aiming to upgrade ships next


[12-Apr-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Apr-24 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	Oh but for FE makes sense


[12-Apr-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AinzOoalGown**:	Yeah only got 2 bases at mo, 2nd just built 2 days ago


[12-Apr-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I started out at deimos earlier and with AL, I could do like 1 ship for 4 bases


[12-Apr-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**WhosRodrix**:	I want FE to annoy me now this time, make it more fun


[12-Apr-24 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127

**WhosRodrix**:	Well if anyone else needs FEO, I've got 135 available, just let me know if you posted an ad since I can't myself, any cheap price works for me, it's just extra produce I can't use right now.

**Emperor007**:	Can I build more than the 2 ships that I currently have?


[13-Apr-24 12:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	yes, You have to have needed parts for build and lic PRO


[13-Apr-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	but also keep in mind that in all lic, except PRO, you can take in fly 2 ships in one time only


[13-Apr-24 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	I also thought that I will need a PRO license to build one.. But I just now got a contract from NEO Charter Expanse Officer to finish a ship construction project.


[13-Apr-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	How do I fulfill the contract?


[13-Apr-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	You have already take it?


[13-Apr-24 12:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Nope


[13-Apr-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Just wondering


[13-Apr-24 12:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	\o/ :)


[13-Apr-24 12:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you can reject, you can ignore, you can find a corp where gamers will help you to take parts


[13-Apr-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	The reward for fulfilling this contract is very lucrative... That's why I am unable to decide.


[13-Apr-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you can buy parts yourself on CX


[13-Apr-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	yes. I can buy parts but then what will I do?


[13-Apr-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you have bring them to the warf (there is on Pallada) and make a project


[13-Apr-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	I can't make new ship cause I am not PRO.. Can I upgrade mine?


[13-Apr-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	PRO only


[13-Apr-24 12:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	for upgrade too


[13-Apr-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	darn but why did I get that contract then?? Weird


[13-Apr-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	\o/ :)


[13-Apr-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	I rekomend you to take at least one month of PRO - after then your lic will be basic. Its not good as PRO, but not bored as free. And you will take a time to build ships and upgrade hq


[13-Apr-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	*And you will take some time (in PRO) to


[13-Apr-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Just checked that the price for 48 BHP is more that the reward I will get.


[13-Apr-24 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	and 48 BHP is just 1 of the components needed for the most basic ship


[13-Apr-24 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	life is a pain


[13-Apr-24 12:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Btw you said something about HQ upgrade.. Can I not upgrade HQ without being PRO?


[13-Apr-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you can, but only for lvl 10


[13-Apr-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	lvl 10??


[13-Apr-24 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	You mean 10 levels of upgrade?


[13-Apr-24 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	yep, sorry my eng)


[13-Apr-24 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	I tell you, that without lic PRO u cant upgrade hq higher then 10 lvl


[13-Apr-24 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Apr-24 12:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Verdant.  I have bases here and on Verdant, and Verdant covers my O and C needs on Vallis completely, as well as DW and RAT.  Excess oxygen and carbon are also turning out to be excellent cash crops.


[15-Apr-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I did have to upgrade one of my starter ships to a WCB because 500/500 wasn't enough to keep up.


[15-Apr-24 12:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Awesome.. I think I really need a carbon plant.. The carbon prices are annoying!


[15-Apr-24 12:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	how much did the upgrade cost?


[15-Apr-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	talk to @--schaitr--.  He offers discounted WCBs for players under 180 days.  Two options at 500k and 640k, depending on if you upgrade the fuel tanks or not.


[15-Apr-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	He doesn;t provide the BHP or SSC necessary, those ran me another 85k.


[15-Apr-24 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	So, how do I make a new base?


[15-Apr-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Worth noting because your butt gets WIDE you'll need to spend more fuel to transit so the extra fuel tanks are pretty nice


[15-Apr-24 12:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Step 1: finish your base on Vallis.  New bases are expensive.


[15-Apr-24 12:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Apr-24 11:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	if the cont have status Closed - you dont need to do anything, it cancelled automatic

[17-Apr-24 11:32 AM] ApexChat#8127

**DYSIODE**:	You can see all the statuses in the CONTS buffer


[17-Apr-24 11:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Closed means that nobody of partners do thmsg. Partially fullfilled means that one or both do not makes all moves for this contract, in this way after deadline will be violation

**CaineUWU**:	Is there a way to raise number of max experts on a base?


[17-Apr-24 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Max is 6 in each base, with a max of 5 in 1 industry


[17-Apr-24 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CaineUWU**:	dang


[17-Apr-24 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	You can USE a maximum of 6 experts, at most 5 in ONE industry :: but you can HAVE 45 experts on a base (5 in each of 9 categories) - but the 39 not used just sit in the bar.

**Czupurek**:	Hello. A beginner's question: what are the largest shipments that can be transported? Is it possible to divide a large package into smaller ones after accepting the contract?


[18-Apr-24 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Hello! The base ship is 500t/500m^3. Largest hybrid is 2000/2000. Biggest weight is 3000/1000. Largest volume is 1000/3000


[18-Apr-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Czupurek**:	Thanks, now i see it in blueprints.


[18-Apr-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	No you cannot break up the shipment after accepting it, unfortunately


[18-Apr-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Czupurek**:	good to know


[18-Apr-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Learned it the hard way a couple months ago, they had already paid me too so I felt extra bad


[18-Apr-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	we sorted it out though


[18-Apr-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	@--SCHAITR-- offers upgrades to a WCB (3k/1k) cargo bay for under market rate for new players. He has details on the UFO discord. I think it's 470k for just the cargo bay, so something to work toward


[18-Apr-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Yeah I got one of those through him and it revolutionized my industry, since I have to ship metal and ore


[18-Apr-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	I believe the cut off is 180 days since you started so if it gets close to that you could potentially get a loan from someone

**SpectacledHusky**:	Hello?


[19-Apr-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Hi


[19-Apr-24 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Evening


[19-Apr-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	Nearly noon for me. One of my contracts says to survey a planet in the Moria system (my base is on Vallis) what do I do?


[19-Apr-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Surveying involves flying to the planet with one of your ships, landing on it, opening up the contract and clicking fulfill.


[19-Apr-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	oh. I sent one of my 2 ships to Moria Station, should I keep my other one on site or fly it there?


[19-Apr-24 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It's worth doing the math on how much fuel this will cost you, quite often survey contrracts are not worth it.


[19-Apr-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	It would only be worth it if I had something to go to also in the area?


[19-Apr-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Are you still in the tutorial?  Your ship probably got sent to to MOR for a reason.


[19-Apr-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	No, one of my contracts said to send a ship to MOR. I am sending some iron ore to trade


[19-Apr-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	TBH, I just decline survey contracts every time.  Either they make no money, or they tie up a ship for two days for very little gain.


[19-Apr-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	Ok. If I eventually build scout ships for that, would it be worth it?


[19-Apr-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	lemmie just check the rewards for it


[19-Apr-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	That contract that had you send the ship to MOR will very likely be followed by one that has you buy stuff there, so you'll need that ship.


[19-Apr-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	that's going to MOR, right


[19-Apr-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Ships are terribly expensive. Usually just take a contract that isnt a survey or wait for new ones to pop up in a couple days


[19-Apr-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	No.  The faction contracts will pretty much fade to insignificance after a short while.


[19-Apr-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	Ok, I'm still sending my ship to MOR though. That's a good idea right?


[19-Apr-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Always do the math on cost vs rewards for faction contracts.  I'd guess less than half of the ones you're offered actually allow you to make a profit.


[19-Apr-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The one to MOR is part of a series of tutorial missions.  Sending ships to Moria and back will be the majority of your game for a while.


[19-Apr-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The ones I'm talking about come in groups of three, and you should be getting a set every 16 hours or so at the beginning.


[19-Apr-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	copy that.


[19-Apr-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	also, how do I find my base on a planet?


[19-Apr-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	From the globe display, you mean?  I -think- it's the yellow patch.  Not sure though, it doesn't really matter where on a planet your base is.


[19-Apr-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SpectacledHusky**:	I only see green/red patches


[19-Apr-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	can you spin it? RMB and drag


[19-Apr-24 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Apr-24 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127

[23-Apr-24 06:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	I have never seen that, if your current workforce is higher than your required it might be because you removed a production building - it will then rebalance at the next population report (those are done weekly)


[23-Apr-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TR4X**:	i just started yesterday and plopped down 2 pioneer habitats, a smelter and an extractor.  i have no idea why uI have 110 required but 200 current.  maybe i plopped the habitats before the production buildings.


[23-Apr-24 06:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TR4X**:	also there is 1 building without orders but apparently I cannot fire the workers :-)


[23-Apr-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Oh, when you start you are "gifted" 200 pioneers - if they don't have jobs they will wander off at the end of the week.


[23-Apr-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	It isn't a big deal on a settled planet, but if you go to an empty planet it at least lets you start something


[23-Apr-24 06:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**TR4X**:	ok.  is there a fixed time once a week when the redistribution of the workforce happens?  every basic overall counts :-)

**Ravick**:	Ok, Vallis, as governor, I would like to try an experiment.  I will explain...


[24-Apr-24 10:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I would like to upgrade the Security Drone Post to improve the safety at Vallis


[24-Apr-24 10:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	This upgrade requires approx. $1.2 MM to complete


[24-Apr-24 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	To fund this project, the Vallis Gov will raise capital in the form of Vallis Development Bonds, which can be purchased by anyone on Vallis


[24-Apr-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The Vallis Gov, will issue 12 bonds at 100k per bond.  The interest payments and principal repayments on this bonds is guaranteed by me.


[24-Apr-24 10:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The bonds will pay investors 7% interest per week for 2 weeks at which point they will be repaid.


[24-Apr-24 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Please DM me if interested.  The bonds will be a loan to me at a 7% interest rate per week for 2 weeks, and I will use the proceeds to upgrade the Security Drone Post.


[24-Apr-24 10:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	So if you make 7% per week on your money.  If interested DM me.  Thanks all.

[24-Apr-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**lord_kelvin441**:	Neither do I, but having seen material requirements, will try to contribute some over the course of next 2 weeks.


[24-Apr-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	The extra security should help increase happiness which will help us grow our population


[24-Apr-24 11:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	These bonds are probably best suited for mid to late stage players that have 100k kind of sitting around and wouldn't mind putting it to work for 2 weeks

[24-Apr-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	That's awesome on the SUN - Vallis is a buyer so let me know if you get a supply running


[24-Apr-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Linski and Farlgerann - no problem at all.  You are likely making more than 7% per week on your capital so these bonds wouldn't really be interesting for you.  I expect there are other more established players with cash sitting around.


[24-Apr-24 07:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

Also, big thanks to The Star Business for the generous contribution of RBH and RSE.  We had many players that offered to contribute materials or produce inputs at a discount for this upgrade and others that wanted to invest in bonds but didn't quite have the cash.

**DYSIODE**:	This is not a game that involves a lot of active play, there are times when you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off, but mostly you're planning, setting the plan into motion, then going and living a full life while your sla- I mean workers labor for your gain

**vkinoe**:	ye just did that haha


[02-May-24 06:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	if you have your ship on a station - you can handle with it. If not - you have to rent a warehouse on the station


[02-May-24 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vkinoe**:	Ok so i just started an hour ago, both my ships are here, so i can send them to get it?


[02-May-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vkinoe**:	is it useful at all for me to build a collector? i was just thinking ok if i need to produce iron i need oxygen


[02-May-24 06:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	after buying you can to bring your stuff yourself on your ship or add a shipping ad on a station and then wait \o/


[02-May-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you have started with some prefabs, you are used them already?


[02-May-24 06:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**starWanderer**:	ah, ok. Its time to go to the travel)


[02-May-24 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Right. You smelt a bit of FE and sell it at the exchange. You then buy more carbon and oxygen to make more FE


[02-May-24 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vkinoe**:	so its a good idea to build a collector right? so i dont have to buy o2


[02-May-24 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Ive heard both. I just buy it all. What do you do @starWanderer?

**starWanderer**:	you have two ways


[02-May-24 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-May-24 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vkinoe**:	Guys where can i get carbon except for buying it?


[03-May-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	You can grow the required plants on an agri world and process it into Carbon


[03-May-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	such as Verdant


[03-May-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vkinoe**:	can i do that as a metal thingy?


[03-May-24 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vkinoe**:	metalurgy


[03-May-24 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	I believe agriculture is the only way to produce Carbon, metallurgy is very dependent on it so thats why prices have been soaring


[03-May-24 07:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	my buddy started agriculture, and I grow all his materials on verdant he sells it back to me cheap after processing


[03-May-24 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**vkinoe**:	smart


[03-May-24 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	You're able to do anything with any starting "profession" it's most so a way of giving you a good place to start


[03-May-24 08:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	mostly a way*


[03-May-24 08:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	-technically- you can even grow the plants needed to make carbon on Vallis, but it would be extremely inefficient and probably only exists for the very early universe


[03-May-24 09:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	And also make sure you're smelting with FLX.NC1 it will mean you use less C per FE

**Flinter**:	nice, i like logging on and seeing all my contracts taken and completed lol that was a lot of iron i had to ship back to planet. finally decided no more smelting iron im making steel now so iron prices should go back up


[04-May-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-May-24 10:36 AM] ApexChat#8127

[04-May-24 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Oh shit, Flinter was making 940 FE a week, so that's ~1900 FE/wk difference (assuming that same amount gets bought)

**Kegman96**:	AL.NC1 hasnt recovered from its price spike a month or two ago and thats been great dor my wallet


[04-May-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	yeah i had 2k stockpiled for FE but once my stockpile is gone which was on market to begin with then ill be buying up lots so prices should go up there


[04-May-24 02:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Kegman96**:	Could be worth it to invest in a PP1


[05-May-24 04:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	^ It's extremely worth it, imo, not even for the money from sales but for your own uses. Building a new base is much cheaper when you provide all the basic prefabs

[12-May-24 10:42 AM] ApexChat#8127

[12-May-24 11:29 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Retread**:	Hi there


[12-May-24 03:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	I take it I need to mine / produce basic materials to be able to construct things. How do I break basic minerals like iron?


[12-May-24 03:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Are you following the tutorials?


[12-May-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	Yes, it told me to build a couple of starting things to get production running, but now it ended (?) and I am none the wiser regarding materialsa.


[12-May-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The basic loop buy inputs, process them to create products, and sell the products


[12-May-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It's a slow game, once you set up that initial production, there's not much to do until it finishes.


[12-May-24 03:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	It's building a basic bulkhead it seems.


[12-May-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lord_kelvin441**:	Constructor profession?


[12-May-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	Yes


[12-May-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lord_kelvin441**:	Your basic materials are Iron Ore. Limestone, Oxygen and Water. Water. Water is double indirect input to Carbon which together with Oxygen is used to ore into iron, Then you combine Iron and Limestone into construction prefabs


[12-May-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lord_kelvin441**:	There's another loop involvin Carbon, Hydroneg and Magnesite


[12-May-24 03:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lord_kelvin441**:	Also, you can use some Limestone to make Flux, which increases efficiency of smelting Iron.


[12-May-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**lord_kelvin441**:	Feel free to buy any intermediates mentioned


[12-May-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	So. I buy things like Iron, Limestone etc?


[12-May-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	It's not aquired by my work force?


[12-May-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	You can extract them too


[12-May-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	Under what tab / command?


[12-May-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wolferath**:	OT-580c


[12-May-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Not an ideal starting planet as this planet gives a bonus to smelting rather than construction


[12-May-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	I can maybe start over somehow :)


[12-May-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	You can restart if you want. Do you want to stay on this planet and do smelting or do you want to do contruction on another planet?


[12-May-24 04:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wolferath**:	I can stay and do smelting, i don't mind. Unless my char now is totally unfit for it


[12-May-24 04:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Your current company is not really made for it. Id suggest using the command COLIQ. That will liquidate your company and start you over. If you choose construction again then choose Montem as your starting planet. Otherwise choose smelting and come right back here


[12-May-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Novachrono28**:	Montem is OT-580b


[12-May-24 04:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**DYSIODE**:	That said, Chem COGC planets are rarer than Metallurgy, so restarting on Montem isn't the worst option either, but I'm 5 months in and have 2 BMP, 2 CHP, 2 CLF, 5 PP1, a PP2, and PP3 on Vallis, in addition to my Metallurgy buildings, and while I do use most of my own metal I make a lot more off the tier 2 goods than the metal

**CaineUWU**:	How profitable are shipping contracts?


[13-May-24 12:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Your revenue - stake, your expenses - fuel and ships repair. Fuel - it is kilometers and parsecs


[13-May-24 12:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	different routes - different expenses


[13-May-24 12:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	some offers are for fuel only, some offers - for not empty cargo. But time to time there are fat ships \o/

[05-Jun-24 08:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jun-24 08:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	to do shipping someone hase to send you a shipping contract or u have to take them from local markets.


[05-Jun-24 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jun-24 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127

[05-Jun-24 08:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	u cant accept contracts or local market add in free. think like that free is a DEMO. in free u can only have max 6 bases. if u check the link and click to see all included features.


[05-Jun-24 08:25 AM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Jun-24 12:11 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Emperor007**:	I was caluculating the income and expense and I think selling BDE is slightly better than BBH since I have a BMP. But now I won't be able to use my Iron and I guess BBH is great since it uses up all my iron and is extremely lightweight compared to Iron(means less fuel needed to ship). So now what will be the most effective thing to do with all the iron?


[09-Jun-24 08:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	possibly steel >> power tools


[09-Jun-24 09:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	That might be good. I think using the recipe of 1 STL + 2 SFK for 6 PT is best. It has more profit that BBH.


[09-Jun-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	But STL requires a decent amount of oxygen and my one collector here can't do the job. I guess I need to move to Verdant.

[10-Jun-24 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Hello Vallis - I would like to upgrade some infrastructure at Vallis and would like to offer investors the opportunity to fund these upgrades.  We will upgrade Security Drone Post to Level 3 and Wildlife Park to Level 7.  This will require $3.7 MM NCC.  We offer 37 bonds at $100k each.  The bonds pay 7% interest per week and the bonds will be outstanding for 14 days.  Please DM me if you are interested.  I will leave the offerring open for a few days so please let me know if you are interested.


[10-Jun-24 11:27 AM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jun-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Sure is! It's very metallurgy focused so expect to be doing a lot of smelting and selling or using the FE (though importing ore can be profitable too)

**GaleFyre**:	Luckily I picked metalurgist


[11-Jun-24 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[11-Jun-24 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	You get a pretty reasonable construction bonus from your HQ too so building prefabs is a reasonable use of the FE you make


[11-Jun-24 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	That's neat! That game is more economics focused, but I'm sure you'll still find it really fun :)

**DYSIODE**:	planets have governors that are responsible for managing planetary infrastructure, and usually use taxes to buy all the regular maintenance items (though you -can- contribute, you're not expected to)

**GaleFyre**:	im a bit lost as to how to turn a profit on iron metal production


[14-Jun-24 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	If you smelt FE you should turn profit at current prices


[14-Jun-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GaleFyre**:	but the cost of carbon is more then the cost of FE


[14-Jun-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	You use one carbon to get 4 FE


[14-Jun-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	use the recipe with FLX


[14-Jun-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GaleFyre**:	OH


[14-Jun-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GaleFyre**:	Tysm


[14-Jun-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	You could also try importing Titanium or Aluminium ore and smelting that, there's bigger margin right now


[14-Jun-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	but it requires more investment and more transport


[14-Jun-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GaleFyre**:	I was just panicing, made my first sell at Moira and I was checking my numbers and paniced I really appreciate you pointing out the flux recipe and as Im just getting started itll probably be easier


[14-Jun-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	yeah money comes slowly at the beginning


[14-Jun-24 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	If you feel you could've done something better, you always can restart with command COLIQ


[14-Jun-24 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**GaleFyre**:	I think im doing pretty ok I have an oxygen extractor and an iron one with a smelter running so the only mineral I have to buy at market is flux and carbon


[14-Jun-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	Collecting oxygen at Vallis is barely profitable. While it might be convenient, in the future consider buying O of CX and having a different building in that place


[14-Jun-24 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SimonBaltzerberg**:	The yellow bar on the planet shows how efficient extracting given resource is

**Broot**:	I personally would gather the consumables needed to last, plus enough mats for your buildings to last. Try setting up larger runs so they take longer/consume more of the inventory


[15-Jun-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	Like get a big run going then refill your inventory with enough to last


[15-Jun-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	Just make sure you leave enough room for the product to come out


[15-Jun-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	If you have less space in your inventory than what you're making it will halt production


[15-Jun-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	If you're able to get on mobile, it will help to rent some warehouse space and keep extra mats in there and just swap things over when the runs complete


[15-Jun-24 12:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	I've got a stack on mobile that is just all my inventorys. Base, ships, warehouses, makes it easier to just go straight to them


[15-Jun-24 02:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	my problem is storage for my production i already have places shutting down due to no storage lol need more ships

**Emperor007**:	Btw I don't know if it is a good idea or not but recently because of a mistake, I had a huge shortage of food. I had food only for a few days and I forgot to fuy food for which getting more food would have taken a very long time. I don't know what happens if you run out of food but I didn't want that to happen. So I got an idea to destroy a few habitation modules(HB1s) and it worked. It was like a fired a few people and my food requirements went down. That saved me but sadly demolishing the building gave me less materials but at that time I was making BBH so it wasn't much of a problem.


[15-Jun-24 05:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Emperor007**:	Oh one other thing was that my production slowed down too

[21-Jun-24 11:06 PM] ApexChat#8127

**consmonaught**:	good to know im new to the game


[21-Jun-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	Lots of nice people in the planet chat, of course there is also the global help chat.


[21-Jun-24 11:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	good to know what do u suggest i should build next i was thinking another smelter


[21-Jun-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	What do you have so far?


[21-Jun-24 11:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	Collector, Extractor, Smelter I assume?


[21-Jun-24 11:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	yep


[21-Jun-24 11:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	I'd probably build another smelter since its easy to get excess ore, though I will note that I'm still pretty new to the game despite my account creation date.


[21-Jun-24 11:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	i would have to build another hab first tho right


[21-Jun-24 11:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	since im at 160/200


[21-Jun-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	If you wanted to you could make a Rig iirc at max out at your current pop limits


[21-Jun-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	Don't quote me on that though


[21-Jun-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	or i mean i was thinking of  saving up upgrading my hq so i can drop another base on a lush planet and make carbon to sell and use here


[21-Jun-24 11:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	i could do that


[21-Jun-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	I haven't considered expanding to another planet yet since I figured that could increase flight costs, though I do wish I had a better supply of carbon too


[21-Jun-24 11:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	do i need anything else to trun water into DW


[21-Jun-24 11:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	Food Processor


[21-Jun-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The simplest possible C base on Verdant (the closest ag planet) consisting of 1 rig, 1 farm, and 1 incinerator would produce 4 carbon a day.


[21-Jun-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	and cost 371k to set up.


[21-Jun-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	yikes


[21-Jun-24 11:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	much better to scale up Vallis first


[21-Jun-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	yea i just got the same in the help chat lol


[21-Jun-24 11:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	sorry, my bad - I scaled down my Verdant base.  it's only 235k


[21-Jun-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	When I was more active there would be guys who'd do good carbon deals occasionally on the local market


[21-Jun-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	it was more of am idea i dont got that kind of capital yet


[21-Jun-24 11:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Jun-24 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	true but id need mor extractors and collectors as well


[21-Jun-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**consmonaught**:	btw whats the ratio for that is it like 1c/1e per smelter


[21-Jun-24 11:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	You will have plenty of time to plan.


[21-Jun-24 11:45 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Spiotwo**:	Yes, this planet has water, oxygen and hydrogen, but the yield is low and not worth the expense to extract it. The same can be said about farms - they'll just take up space and people better used for more extractors and smelters


[22-Jun-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	Your biggest raw material expense is carbon, so it makes sense to build an incinerator and buy plants to feed it, it'll cut your carbon expenses by about half


[22-Jun-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	For the rest - oxygen, food, water etc its best to just buy it on the CX


[22-Jun-24 07:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	After you earn enough you can set up prefab plants (PP1), they can take your iron and transform it into prefab parts. Those are much more easy to ship (since they are lighter) and always in demand.


[22-Jun-24 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Spiotwo**:	Thats basically the entire early game path on Vallis


[22-Jun-24 08:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Phoenixtfg**:	I'm new to the game, done a fair bit of reading and watching some clips, and i like the idea and mechanics of the game, but it really just feels overly slow paced

[22-Jun-24 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	This time I'm content with just this one base. I get on only s couple times a day to move product from/to ships and send them off, set up new orders

[25-Jun-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	I think a lot of people don't realize that they don't actually *want* to play video games as much as they do. If you force yourself to do something completely unrelated to computers, like reading a fun book, going on a walk, or some other productive activity you will not only improve yourself but you'll also find playing games more enjoyable again.

**Retread**:	@SaintIsidore, almost done the Foundation series, again.  Got a couple of recommendations for the next book this morning.

The Foundation series (or trilogy) is a science fiction book series written by American author Isaac Asimov. First published as a series of short stories and novellas in 1942–50, and subsequently in three collections in 1951–53, for nearly thirty years the series was a trilogy: Foundation (1951); Foundation and Empire (1952); and Second Foundati...

**SaintIsidore**:	Ahh Asimov. Never read anything from him, but have heard high praises from almost everyone.


[25-Jun-24 10:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein.  Between those three authors, years of reading.

**SaintIsidore**:	I've been listening to audiobooks for a few months.


[25-Jun-24 10:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I used to listen to audiobooks driving to work, but have been WFH since the pandemic.


[25-Jun-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	I typically read non-fiction, and I have a ton of books queued up. I don't like spending my limited amount of focus on fiction so audiobooks let me enjoy them when I'm doing mindless activities like driving, mowing the lawn, walking, etc.


[25-Jun-24 10:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SaintIsidore**:	I enjoy fiction a lot, just hard for me to read in print these days.

[25-Jun-24 10:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	what I'm interested in is down a 5,000 m deep hole hundreds of kilometers away.  Whether I monitor what's happening from my house or my office doesn't turn out to matter much.

**Ravick**:	Hello Vallis - The election will begin in 1 day and 6 hrs.  I am happy to have the privilege to serve as your governor and I appreciate your vote in the upcoming election.  It is great to see so many good candidates up for election on this planet.  I believe that we will have an excellent parliament.  I did want to mention again that I am endorsing @--SHAITR-- for parliament.  He is the current gov of Prom and an all around good guy.

[06-Jul-24 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Basically there are two paths to making C - the fast or slow recipes.  The 'slow' recipe burns HCP while the 'fast' recipe burns HCP/GRN/MAI. (fast takes twice the inputs as the slow, but is 8 hours versus 24 hours).


[06-Jul-24 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	If you decide to use the 'slow' then it is most effeicient to use a HYF (hydroponic farm building - which you can put on ANY planet) to grow HCP (8 per 9.6 hours)


[06-Jul-24 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	It costs more H2O and uses NS, but is faster - thus maximizes use of your permit space.

**DYSIODE**:	I do think the first few days are a bit steep of a curve, both with the fire hydrant of TLAs and systems, but also your first order taking forever. Having some shipments or small amount of goods already in production based on your starting loadout would probably keep people interested through the hump

**dakota1234**:	I haven't looked to see which bubble led the other, I sorta assumed someone who produced a lot of ALO stopped


[18-Aug-24 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Maybe they started smelting it themselves when the metal price soared. I used to see ALO offers on LM often and I never do now, makes sense since CX price climbed ig

[20-Aug-24 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	Every week a population update occurs, new workers spawn and go to any open jobs or sit in unemployment


[20-Aug-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	if theres 0% unemployment then you need to build the living quarters and jobs then wait for more pops to spawn


[20-Aug-24 05:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	Hello Vallis! The election is underway!  I wanted to let everyone know that I am not going to run for Gov.  It has been an honor to serve you, and I will ensure that the new parliament and Gov have what they need to do a great job!  We are lucky to have a great parliament and so many dedicated players on Vallis!

[29-Aug-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Schait - how much of a buffer do you think is adequate on population?  I am running a bunch of smaller planets and am aiming at 15% or so - but figure once the planet gets larger its the absolute count for a buffer that is more important?


[30-Aug-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you look at Prom, I go for absolute buffer rather than %. It would give a humongous buffer for PIOs if I went by %


[30-Aug-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Yeah, but FW-691c has 2 bases on it - LOL - I mean I run some really SMALL planets


[30-Aug-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I also aim to maintain pop without any programs but every planet's different


[30-Aug-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Biggest planet I run is YI-280d - but it is a major headache


[30-Aug-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Settler unemployment is 66% - trying to get that to a reasonable level


[30-Aug-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	You can consider setting a minimum absolute pop depending on the planet's popularity and how a full base will impact the buffer


[30-Aug-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	That's a good idea


[30-Aug-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	(YI-280d has only 22 bases)


[30-Aug-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Anyway, I think it polite to tell the gov beforehand if you're dropping a full base, especially if the buffer isn't much.


[30-Aug-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	Definitely agree with that - especially if you are looking for Techs and above


[30-Aug-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-24 09:34 AM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Aug-24 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	Common wisdom is to repair them before they reach 80% as the fall off in performance grows


[30-Aug-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	what i mean is, if its 1% it has x materials needed to repair. If its 10% damaged, does it require 10 * X to repair?


[30-Aug-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	I don't believe the fall off is linear, but I haven't tracked it that close. What most people do is to repair it before it increases travel time.


[30-Aug-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	Sorry im not being clear, does the resource cost for repairs increase linearly with damage or is it tiered or a flat rate??


[30-Aug-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	I believe it is tiered, in that it remains the same during about a 5 percent window. Each threshhold it crosses, increases it by 1 SSC and 1 BHP. I have never seen it above the 12 MFK and 8 FLP. They seem constant.


[30-Aug-24 02:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	Although I don't typically let mine go below about 88%.


[30-Aug-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	if you dig around the community resources section of the handbook there's... somewhere, wish I could remember, where someone did a very good writeup


[30-Aug-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Logic99**:	Which is 5 each of BHP & SSC


[30-Aug-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	it's nonlinear, IIRC something of an inverted s-curve


[30-Aug-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	but weird enough that you really have to read the whole thing for it to make any sense

[31-Aug-24 03:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Xk37**:	workforce that isn't producing anything doesn't consume anything. You starterd with 200 "free" PIO, when the consumption increased as you added production buildings.

[31-Aug-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	in the "WF" buffer you can check out the exact numbers and do the math yourself


[31-Aug-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	unfortunate that it doesn't show the base rates (per 100) for any category actively being consumed tho, but you can sorta work it out backward


[31-Aug-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	yea i did that yesterday, but like you said, you cant see the ones currently consumed.  At least i have all the other ones down now


[31-Aug-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	good thing i sent a ship to the station yesterday, it should make it back before they run out


[31-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Your consumption is based on your `Current` workforce numbers. Your Housing is just an indication of how many workers you CAN have, but if you don't have any production facilities that need them you won't hire up to the capacity


[31-Aug-24 04:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	Also, you do still have to feed your workers even if your production lines are idle


[31-Aug-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**DYSIODE**:	But you also are returned all the resources used to build a facility minus the repair cost, so if you're expecting to leave a production line idle for a while you can dismantle the building at effectively no cost


[31-Aug-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[07-Sep-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	if you open a FLT buffer you can access your ships - and then on the right under "commands" there's "fly"


[07-Sep-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	then you select a destination, adjust the fuel sliders (generally you want FTL fuel all the way to the left) and hit "go"

**Cheeki_Breeki**:	what happens if rations and water run out


[09-Sep-24 10:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**astroninja221**:	from what I've read, you just lose efficiency until you run completely out of 1 of your required resources. Then production halts


[09-Sep-24 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	You do, and it does.


[09-Sep-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	Are luxuries worth the investment initially or are there better things to invest into?


[09-Sep-24 10:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	They are usually worth it


[09-Sep-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**astroninja221**:	it also sometimes depends on if you care for the extra hastle. Using luxury items for me right now changes my ROI by 5 days, but it's more to remember


[09-Sep-24 10:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	They look expensive, but you usually need fewer in quantity, so it works out. The additional efficiency, and reduced production time are worth unless you have to prioritize inputs for some reason


[09-Sep-24 10:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	I thought about trying padded work overalls before caffeinated infusions and just calculating their benefit but i figured I'd ask first


[09-Sep-24 10:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Ah, you started on Vallis. Basic consumables first, then PWO, then COF


[09-Sep-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**astroninja221**:	would it be better to become self reliant ASAP, or try to build some profits before considering an attempt?


[09-Sep-24 10:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	And I would recommend your second base be on Verdant, before Danakil


[09-Sep-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	I kind of built another smelter, no idea if it was the right choice but it felt right instead of trying to branch out


[09-Sep-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	It really depends on where you start, but in general, yes. Revenue is important though, so if you can, sell excess and take shipping contracts. This is one of those areas where being pro/basic greatly simplifies things


[09-Sep-24 10:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Local markets, and help from players


[09-Sep-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	be careful not to get greedy and burn more fuel value than what you earn in the contracts.


[09-Sep-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	That would apply to accepting and completing missions as well


[09-Sep-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	thanks for the help Isoroku


[09-Sep-24 10:53 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Sep-24 11:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MistaGoat05**:	Lmaoooooooo


[12-Sep-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	So how does the game expand as I get further along?


[12-Sep-24 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	Right now I just kind of have the option to get more basic workers and more mines up and running


[12-Sep-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	Or another refinery (but I have limited money for the inputs)


[12-Sep-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	Should I try and get more workers/structures or just let live with 800 NCC a day for now


[12-Sep-24 11:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	That's the first step. Part of the game is fining out what your best route is.


[12-Sep-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	Alright for sure I'll try playing around with the numbers in my spreadsheet a bit


[12-Sep-24 12:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	I build a second smelter as my inputs made excess and my metal makes more than the raw mine


[12-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	I think same here it's about double the income even with carbon being so expensive plus iron is free


[12-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	I also invested in luxuries. It cuts production time


[12-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	I was thinking about doing that


[12-Sep-24 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	I think I still make about 800/day with one refinery if I include the price of luxuries


[12-Sep-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	Cause they aren't used that much


[12-Sep-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	I'm gonna send my first ship to the commodity exchange and then log off I think


[12-Sep-24 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	I don't want to give away all the answers, but have you considered looking at what that iron can be made into?


[12-Sep-24 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MistaGoat05**:	Oooooo good point I'll do more research on that after class td, I have a lot just sitting around and I think it'd be better if I don't sell it.

[14-Sep-24 08:14 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Retread**:	Assuming you mean revenue per day, and purchasing all the inputs, I get a similar number for Ti (122/hr), but roughly double what you're getting for STL (113/hr).  Are you maybe missing that two STL are produced per cycle?


[14-Sep-24 08:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**stefan316**:	If I need prefabs and the price is good I buy on the LM if available, but usually its to expensive on the lm - if sb needs it very quick he will pay good, even more than on the cx.


[14-Sep-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stefan316**:	and on the lm you have to pay a fee, on the cx there is no fee for the ad


[14-Sep-24 11:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stefan316**:	but you need to be pro or basic, not free


[14-Sep-24 11:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**stefan316**:	and if you are pro think about a shipping contract to the cx. I usually pay 3x the price of the tonnage. If the m3 is very high even more for the m3

**CraftsmanThirteen**:	The way the gov works is that players have to buy material and stuck it into the supply needs - so the gov has to pay the players back - the gov can't just buy stuff directly or even have a warehouse.

[26-Sep-24 10:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Sep-24 10:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	there's taxes and then there is errors in calculations though. We have more control over our own actions than the taxes


[26-Sep-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	We should be able to lower taxes as we go through the culling program. Still working out the numbers though


[26-Sep-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**SingleWinged**:	And honestly, I believe we should focus on our own errors than trying to ask others to amend them


[26-Sep-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Malinko**:	why would we not want to bring scientists in when there are open jobs for them?


[04-Oct-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Since I have reduced the POPI levels to cull the unemployed PIOs and SETs, we do not have enough to keep our SCI. I'm selectively using immigration programs for ENG/SCI to keep the numbers stable.


[04-Oct-24 09:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	This method still saves us on expenses since we don't spend as much on POPI inputs.


[04-Oct-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Once we have stablised the populations, I will look into reducing the taxes, especially for the lower tiers (we're a starter planet afterall)


[04-Oct-24 09:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	Broot asked why we are bringing in scientists like its a bad thing.  I was just wondering why that would be bad


[04-Oct-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	It's a valid question, and I'm fine with explaining why I went for that


[04-Oct-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	i get what your saying. I was just wondering why it would be bad to do. I dont know anything about the government operations and very little about population in general since it hasnt been a problem for me yet

[05-Oct-24 12:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**illuineru**:	its not bad. just sub-optimal. Vallis is a metallurgy planet. There is no metallurgy building in scientist tier and its not optimal to build a different building other than metalurgy hence u dont get %25 bonus.


[05-Oct-24 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Broot**:	What @illuineru said mostly. It's a starter planet with a focus on metallurgy, seems less than ideal to bring them in at a glance

**Cheeki_Breeki**:	i feel the next metal comoity may be TI as its price seems to be in a decline, its a still very profitable in my eyes tho (Biased maybe my NO1 export)


[13-Oct-24 10:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cheeki_Breeki**:	not so sure tho its got a 1/3 supply to demand


[13-Oct-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cheeki_Breeki**:	while TIO is a 11/4 suplly to demand


[13-Oct-24 10:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cheeki_Breeki**:	good resource


[13-Oct-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Kegman96**:	with the gateways coming out in the future and Advanced- prefabs being needed to make them that should drive up TI prices pretty significantly


[13-Oct-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Oct-24 10:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Oct-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[13-Oct-24 10:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MapReduce**:	closer to the CX?


[22-Nov-24 11:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	One of the advantages to being concentrated on systems with CXs is that you can utilize STL ships, which are much cheaper than FTL ships.


[22-Nov-24 11:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MysteriousWalrus**:	Closer to CX - alternatively it's not exclusively good for Chemistry. I produce a lot of LST there.

**LINKZ**:	anytime, thanks again!, see you around, oh how do i get another ship or get a better one for transporting FE?


[27-Nov-24 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	You need upgrade or build a new one, both of which are expensive for a new player. There is several ways to get a speed up to your start


[27-Nov-24 12:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	some people can be overly generous to new players (rarer) with good contract terms. Some will pay you to operate bases where you provide them with all the output


[27-Nov-24 12:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	As for the ship, upgrading to a larger cargo hold tends to be recommended first upgrade


[27-Nov-24 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	you can set up a buffer for ship design and you can see what the upgrade materials are and plan for the future. I know there is a couple vallis corps that buy FE in large quantities as well


[27-Nov-24 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	just watch the chat for the offers, they normally want to do direct contracts


[27-Nov-24 12:44 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	There are people who will offer sizeable loans as well. Personally I have not gone that route, but its out there. Join the disocrd as well. There is plenty of interaction there and if you like the UI there, it can be easier to chat


[27-Nov-24 01:01 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 06:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	so id say 2 SME's but im a noob also


[28-Nov-24 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you're right


[28-Nov-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	and once you have the second SME, you can start building COL so you don't have to ship so much oxygen


[28-Nov-24 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	and don't forget to build enough HB1 to house your workers


[28-Nov-24 06:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	i went a different route and did a INC to make my own Carbon, 1 INC isnt enough for both SME but halves the carbon cost


[28-Nov-24 06:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	i have 1 EXC, 1 INC and 2 SME with a work force of 200


[28-Nov-24 07:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	Carbon does take time, and the only way to make it faster makes it more expensive per C. I bought C until I had 6 farms to produce enough HCP and MAI to sustain two INC. But I also make my own RATs which takes up most of the farm output


[28-Nov-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dxrkflamez**:	hey Linkz, i have 1 extractor for 4 smelters. my extractor gets 28 ore every 24 hours, and my smelters can smelt 8 units each for 32 FE total in 21 hours, which means its not totally viable,


[28-Nov-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dxrkflamez**:	but i have 80 extra ore i brought in from other places.


[28-Nov-24 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dxrkflamez**:	@linkz


[28-Nov-24 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 08:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 08:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 08:34 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 08:50 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 08:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	yes


[28-Nov-24 08:54 PM] ApexChat#8127

[28-Nov-24 09:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Dxrkflamez**:	@LINKZ yes, you can do that and get around 4-8 ore leftover every smelting batch

[29-Nov-24 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127

[29-Nov-24 09:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	lol i know, pulled all i needed when i dropped. When i do flip over i will let you know but that will be a 500 TEC/200 ENG drop


[29-Nov-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	Yeah I'll probably need around 2 weeks' notice for that.


[29-Nov-24 09:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	So that looks like it'll be roughly 60-70 ENG short


[29-Nov-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	And that's provided no one else needs them


[29-Nov-24 10:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	If im short a week or 2 thats fine, as Vallis is to replace Kiruna and its still pushing full steam till vallis is rolling coal

**bobnobrain**:	Smelters go brr


[02-Dec-24 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	is that a thing i can buy or?


[02-Dec-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It is your main base building


[02-Dec-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	When you found a base, you drop a CM


[02-Dec-24 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	You can see `bui cm`


[02-Dec-24 09:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	ah seen,understood


[02-Dec-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Core Module (first piece you drop when starting a base)


[02-Dec-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	i see i needed to scroll lol


[02-Dec-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	so to make a new base, i would need to buy that of the CX?


[02-Dec-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Naw, its only a single part for new players first base.


[02-Dec-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	aah


[02-Dec-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	when you look at a new planet just click start base and it will tell you what you need for that planet


[02-Dec-24 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	its generally 4 LDE, 4 LSE, 4 LTA, 8 TRU, 12 PSL and 100 MCG. but some planets need other things like SEA, INS, AEF and others


[02-Dec-24 09:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Some planets also require a bribe for planetary governor


[02-Dec-24 09:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	AEF if its a gas planet, SEA if its low pressure, HSE if its high pressure, INS if its frozen, TSH if its hot. Gravity being off needs BL (high maybe) or MGC but i've not tried that kind of planet as its costly


[02-Dec-24 09:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pizzzaaa**:	i'm not a governor of any planet but i'll gladly accept a bribe if anyone is offering


[02-Dec-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well then become one


[02-Dec-24 09:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Nobody's gonna bribe you if you're not, but it's not that hard to roll into that chair


[02-Dec-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

[02-Dec-24 09:39 AM] ApexChat#8127

**--SCHAITR--**:	Nope you should sell at the CX or LM when possible. Otherwise, work out a permanent arrangement with others.


[04-Dec-24 12:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	Indeed, post it to the LM until your ready to haul to MOR. That way anyone can grab it simply. Just don't forget to clear LM ads if you decide to haul it to MOR.


[04-Dec-24 12:43 AM] ApexChat#8127

**LINKZ**:	hello fellow Vallians, looking for some tips in regarding to expanding from FE/STL production, was maybe looking at making a second base at Montem to do PP1's? or should i stay at Vallis for now


[04-Dec-24 10:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	Currently have 1 COL, 1 EXT, 1 FRM, 1 INC, 2 SME's


[04-Dec-24 10:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Maxing your first base to 500 area is going to be the easiest option, then you can choose to add another 250 area or expand to another planet.


[04-Dec-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	so 250 will use a permit?>


[04-Dec-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Montem is a good option, and has the LST for B-Fabs, you could also look at Danakil (OT-442b) which can often be closer if Montem/Vallis are opposite in their orbits - Danakil runs construction CoGC


[04-Dec-24 10:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	yes, the 250 expansion uses a permit


[04-Dec-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	okay and is it 500 for a base? or depending on location?


[04-Dec-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Depends if you want to be self sufficient or optimise for efficiency


[04-Dec-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	each new base gives 500 (technically 475 because CM)


[04-Dec-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	500 everywhere


[04-Dec-24 10:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	different planet cost different building materials (INS, HSE, etc)


[04-Dec-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Vallis, Montem, and Danakil are all T1 (only MCG)


[04-Dec-24 10:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	ah gotcha, im self sufficient on Vallis other than H2O and im making 18 FE a day, with C and GRN and O Surplus, if i go to STL Prod i dont have enough O


[04-Dec-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah i saw the video for second base stating some planets require extra mats for base depending on the hospitably


[04-Dec-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Verdant could be an interesting option - FRM planet for your DW, RAT, crops for C, and also has O


[04-Dec-24 10:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	lot further out though


[04-Dec-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah DW RAT production might be nice using 12 a day at the moment which is like 2.4k daily run cost in that alone , dropping COF but keeping PWO as COF is way too expensive right now


[04-Dec-24 10:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	can the FRM planet end up making me COF?


[04-Dec-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yep, you can build HYF which make some crops faster but more expensive, one of which is CAF which goes into COF.


[04-Dec-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	also a lot of recommendations i see in regards to expanding is joining a CORP.


[04-Dec-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	okay HYF is settlers?


[04-Dec-24 10:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yep, HYF is settlers, also it doesn't use fertility (FRM's do) so it can be built anywhere, but Verdant runs Agri CoGC and has heaps of H2O


[04-Dec-24 10:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	CORPs will give you more collaborating options, and more communication with buyers/sellers - most corps also have a planet with a corp HQ for a 10% bonus (can only be built on 1 planet per corp)


[04-Dec-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Some corps run a HQ on Verdant for the 10% bonus there


[04-Dec-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	okay thank you so mich for all the info, the fertility bar on planets, if the bar goes left that means less fertile?


[04-Dec-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	yep, though it doesn't make too much difference, I think +-15%? not sure


[04-Dec-24 10:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	also i have 2 differnt experts running, when i have more is it best to 6/6 or 3/6, 3/6 etc?


[04-Dec-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	ah okay not enough to stress about i guess as  a newbie anyway


[04-Dec-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Max of 5 experts per industry, giving 3.06, 6.96, 12.48, 19.74 and 28.4% bonus.


[04-Dec-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	max of 6 experts total


[04-Dec-24 10:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Better to do more in a specific industry if you can, so 5/5 and 1/5


[04-Dec-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	3/3 can also work if your lines are balanced (but it's not the best)


[04-Dec-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah though that 28.4 looks nice


[04-Dec-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	XD


[04-Dec-24 10:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	On Verdant you can reach about 190% if you have the right bonuses


[04-Dec-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	More if you have your own HQ set to Farming bonus


[04-Dec-24 10:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	sheeesh


[04-Dec-24 10:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah, it can get crazy. you need CoGC, 5 experts, corp HQ and fertility for that


[04-Dec-24 10:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	also efficiency just lessens cycle times right?


[04-Dec-24 10:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	yep


[04-Dec-24 10:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	awesome thank you so much for all the info, appreciate it heaps!!!


[04-Dec-24 10:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[08-Dec-24 02:56 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah, i was responding to old mate asking about when to repair his SME;s


[09-Dec-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	SME's*


[09-Dec-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	ok ok I`ll leave you to it then


[09-Dec-24 07:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	hence why i said i think, you might get told when you lose effiency based on the durability?


[09-Dec-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	i have no idea im clutching at straws, havent repaired any buildings yet so completely guessig


[09-Dec-24 07:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	, have you repaired anything?


[09-Dec-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You get time bonus off your planet advertising program, and any experts you apply


[09-Dec-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So if he puts all his experts into metallurgy he`ll be getting something like 30% speed boost


[09-Dec-24 07:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	In the meantime buildings degrade, if he clicks building and scrolls down the list of them


[09-Dec-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It shows their percentage and a repair button


[09-Dec-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	if they degrade do they cause less efficiency?


[09-Dec-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It takes longer to make stuff


[09-Dec-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So if its on 90% thats 10% longer


[09-Dec-24 07:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	But factor in all bonuses and decide whats optimum to repair at.


[09-Dec-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	For instance I dont repair until its dropped to at least 90%


[09-Dec-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	But I use all my other bonuses like experts


[09-Dec-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah okay that makes sense so its 1:1 ratio percentage wise


[09-Dec-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	AS far as I know


[09-Dec-24 07:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It appears to be


[09-Dec-24 07:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	90% is only a minor time lengthening so I would say yes


[09-Dec-24 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	okay awesome, ive got 2 extractor experts and 3 metallurgy experts at the moment


[09-Dec-24 07:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	What planet you on


[09-Dec-24 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	vallis HQ also


[09-Dec-24 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	first planet


[09-Dec-24 07:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	like i said only 45 days in XD


[09-Dec-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Both your extractors iron?


[09-Dec-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah there is no other mineral here?


[09-Dec-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	oh and a collector for O


[09-Dec-24 07:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	and INC is extraction as well i think


[09-Dec-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You should be importing oxygen, your iron is the only profitable one to extract


[09-Dec-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	With your O you will be spending more on RAT and DW and OVE running it than it makes you


[09-Dec-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	eh, im making 18 FE a day and only need H2O to run it


[09-Dec-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	workforce is big but its self sufficient which i like


[09-Dec-24 07:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I know, but overall its cheaper to import your oxygen, water, and hydrogen


[09-Dec-24 07:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Only your Iron is high enough to be profitable


[09-Dec-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	but h20 makes my GRN into C it  only costs 100 NCC to make 4 GRN - 4 C = 2400


[09-Dec-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	For 500 area you optimum build would be some Farms on VEG, BEA, and MAI. Turn the VEG and BEA and MAI into rations.


[09-Dec-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Turn the extra MAI into carbon


[09-Dec-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Import H20 and turn it into DW


[09-Dec-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	And run your smelters


[09-Dec-24 07:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	and just import FEO?


[09-Dec-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	No, keep the FEO extraction


[09-Dec-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	ah okay


[09-Dec-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Get rid of the other resources


[09-Dec-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Import them instead


[09-Dec-24 07:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	so get rid of COL for O, and make an extra FRM?


[09-Dec-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	https://prunplanner.org/search type in vallis and click search. If a resource is in red dont extract it yourself, go for the yellow and green ones

[09-Dec-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Yes, import your O


[09-Dec-24 07:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	i tried using prunplanner but its sooo confusing Xd


[09-Dec-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	With you being on pioneers then for lots and lots of money, lots of Food Processors, import vast amounts of H20, turn it into DW, and sell it back to moria station


[09-Dec-24 07:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	hmm its hard to import O because i want to use the excess O from the COL to make stl every 3 days or something


[09-Dec-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Just transition to being able to import what O you need every 3 days


[09-Dec-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	okay thank you ill give it a look because with all supplies Including Consumables Basic and Luxury im only rmaking 5k profit a day


[09-Dec-24 07:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	That O collector is costing you more in RAT, DW, and OVE, than you are making from it


[09-Dec-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Dont bother with COF yet to save you some money, but the other luxuries are good


[09-Dec-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	100 DW is 10k profit for you


[09-Dec-24 07:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah i was thinking that COF is at 1.5 a day at 730 PPU, where as PWO is 140 for more days


[09-Dec-24 07:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	COF is worth it but not if you need to free up some money early


[09-Dec-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Are you using flux in your smelter?


[09-Dec-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	nope


[09-Dec-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You should do, it gets you an extra iron out


[09-Dec-24 07:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The cost of 1 flux for 1 extra iron is very profitable


[09-Dec-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I wouldnt sell iron though, I wouldn`t even sell steel, I`d be turning the steel into powertools and selling them


[09-Dec-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	But selling steel is good profit


[09-Dec-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	i dont have the funds for the extra buildings


[09-Dec-24 07:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	yep


[09-Dec-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	you`ll get there


[09-Dec-24 07:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	appreicate your help <3


[09-Dec-24 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	No worries


[09-Dec-24 07:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	See you when you have 20 smelters


[09-Dec-24 07:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	ahgahahhaha


[09-Dec-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	XD 20 SME's!? who am i going to sell all that iron too XD


[09-Dec-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Hopefully at that stage you are only selling it as steel


[09-Dec-24 07:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	There is a vast market for iron and steel at Moria, thats just a drop in the ocean


[09-Dec-24 07:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah, just have to figure out the ratio i know its 1 to 1 for FE to STL but the O is the killer in terms of profit


[09-Dec-24 07:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	its cheaper importing it


[09-Dec-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If you are importing H20 1 food processor making nothing but DW is 4k profit to you per day


[09-Dec-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So 5 of them is going to get you 20k pure profit per day


[09-Dec-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	im using H2O to make GRn for C


[09-Dec-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	yeah okay that makes sense


[09-Dec-24 07:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Yes, you need it for C to go into the smelter


[09-Dec-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	That 20k for 5 FP pure profit per day, is after the cost of H20 and RAT/DW/OVE to run them


[09-Dec-24 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its pure profit


[09-Dec-24 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**LINKZ**:	how do i add on prunplanner that im using Lux consumables


[09-Dec-24 07:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Not sure, never tried it


[09-Dec-24 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Each lux only adds 10%


[09-Dec-24 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	10% quicker


[09-Dec-24 07:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So I dont bother with the expensive oens


[09-Dec-24 07:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I didnt bother with COF until I was making it

[09-Dec-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Why? Moria already has one and both planets have been full in recent history (and likely will be again).


[09-Dec-24 04:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Makes more sense having one on Vallis than Moria, but with Moria's already built it seems redundant.


[09-Dec-24 04:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Vallis is now full


[09-Dec-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Phoenixtfg**:	wait, i thought vallis was full months ago, did we have a heap of bases packup off a starter world?


[09-Dec-24 04:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Perhaps


[09-Dec-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, probably account pruning. Started opening up about a month ago.


[09-Dec-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	That's why a redundant shipyard seems a bit of a waste.


[09-Dec-24 04:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	We got 2 now?


[09-Dec-24 04:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Phoenixtfg**:	its alot more convenient on a metallurgist planet


[09-Dec-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Eh. Moria's closer to the CX, I'd argue that the flight from the shipyard to the planet isn't worth the use of the extra plot on the planet.


[09-Dec-24 04:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Don't need a shipyard to repair, after all.


[09-Dec-24 04:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Yeah, a plot wasted


[09-Dec-24 09:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-24 09:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[09-Dec-24 10:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Lhokee**:	True. You are not going to create a Stargate and Hyper-Lane to connect to other sectors from Pallada


[09-Dec-24 10:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Gates require a SHY and the parts aren't transportable?


[09-Dec-24 11:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Gateways won't require a SHY, but they may incentivise STL ship production (as STL can fly through Gateways), so as Vallis would make a lot of ship components, it means less transporting is required to build the ships.


[09-Dec-24 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Fair. With Montem already having one I still question the value.


[09-Dec-24 11:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	It would really make more sense to decommission the one on Montem if it were possible.


[09-Dec-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Yeah, both SHY were built more for the Prestige of it than actual value. Though I agree the Vallis SHY has more use than a Montem one.


[09-Dec-24 11:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Wouldn't really mind if they didn't take a plot to build.


[10-Dec-24 12:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Can you eventually set up any kind of automation in this game or do you have to always manually issue orders to your buildings and stuff?


[10-Dec-24 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	PRO gains recurring orders, and for Trial and Basic you can make a batch size of 20, which is days or even weeks long.


[10-Dec-24 12:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	There's not much automation otherwise


[10-Dec-24 12:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	So no like having ships automatically go to X base and pick up Y amount of something and deliver it to Z before going back to X?


[10-Dec-24 12:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	Unfortunately not, though flight times are long enough it's not an issue, often 24h flights become standard so you can send ships same time each day


[10-Dec-24 12:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	A lot of players would like that, but they manage fine without. DarkFuel even manages to run 144 ships without automation lol


[10-Dec-24 12:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Still though if you're like going on holiday for a month or something and you won't have access for the whole time you'd need a months worth of resources for your bases to churn through if you don't want any down time, and 144 ships seems crazy when I'm sat here with my whole 2 ships lol


[10-Dec-24 12:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	I started like today, I put on 50 units of MCG for a contract and I'm only 30% done with it and that's about it, anyway I need sleep so catch you lot later

[10-Dec-24 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	PRUNplanner, PMMG/RPrUn, and FIO are practically necessary for the game, IMO.


[10-Dec-24 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	I'm not familiar with the other 2 you mentioned, can you give me some details as to what it is they do that PRUNplanner doesn't?


[10-Dec-24 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Sure. PMMG/RPrUn are both browser plugins that offer a number of quality of life features.


[10-Dec-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Refined PrUn is kind of PMMG+, it just recently launched. PMMG is a longstanding plugin.


[10-Dec-24 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	FIO is a data aggregator plugin that pulls from the game and can feed exterior sources, such as Prunplanner. Linking the two will allow it to do things like factor in your inventory for building/maintenance/etc.

[10-Dec-24 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	So is the whole idea of this game basically just to keep upgrading your base and building new bases with new production chains and improving old construction lines until you are big enough to be producing everything you want at crazy rates and making all the money you can?


[10-Dec-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	it's unrealistic to produce everything yourself, but yes


[10-Dec-24 03:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Oh ok, well right now I'm happy producing a little BDE and making a little money so I can work towards getting a base capable of almost completely making BBH in house so to speak, the only thing I will need to input is some silicon but as soon as I have the money to make another base that can produce silicon I'm going to have no costs to produce BBH other than consumables to make sure my workforce doesn't IDK die or something, stop working at any rate


[10-Dec-24 03:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FormerlyDarth**:	y'all know how to change your company name?


[10-Dec-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you have to ask the devs or restart from scratch with the COLIQ command


[10-Dec-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127

[10-Dec-24 04:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Not me forgetting you have to pay a FEE to produce stuff, let's hope I can make a little money before I produce my next batch of PE for my BDE lol, I should be fine I have an active contract for the MCG I'm producing between now and when I produce the PE and I have a half decent amount of PE to work with so I can make some more BDE

**Flinter**:	ive got BO up for 750/ea need about 500 right now probably another 2 or 3 tomorrow


[10-Dec-24 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Too many for me, good luck


[10-Dec-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	can always send me private trade requests at 750 ea and ill take what you got on hand if you like my price


[10-Dec-24 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	saves on shipping which is nice since all my ships are busy atm


[10-Dec-24 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its way to many for me

**AtomicScience**:	Good thing I've stocked up on it


[12-Dec-24 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	BMBL bought all of it


[12-Dec-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	For profit or for lulz?


[12-Dec-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	probably profit


[12-Dec-24 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	they're resseling for ten times the price


[12-Dec-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Probably for lulz


[12-Dec-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	But does anyone buy for 10 times the price?


[12-Dec-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Nobody's gonna buy at those prices


[12-Dec-24 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	It's just not profitable to use it anymore


[12-Dec-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, you are better off just doing no-flux recipes


[12-Dec-24 01:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Good thing though, everyone will pivot their CHPs to fill the vacuum, we are gonna be enjoying some cheap FLX after this blows over


[12-Dec-24 01:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Probably dunno


[12-Dec-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I'm now off to producing my own


[12-Dec-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Are these kinds of stunts a frequent ocurrence?


[12-Dec-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Not really


[12-Dec-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	I did that with AR last week, but that's a niche commodity


[12-Dec-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	A few per year I'd say


[12-Dec-24 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	At least those significant and lingering


[12-Dec-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, it's a shame there is no kind of debouncing against that


[12-Dec-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Stockpiles :)


[12-Dec-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	No I mean at the game level


[12-Dec-24 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	but that's what makes the game fun


[12-Dec-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Idk, perhaps you are right


[12-Dec-24 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Well, you need to work a lot to get that amount of money that will allow you to do such thing


[12-Dec-24 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	There is debouncing, it's an open market so anyone with FLX that wants to sell it can list it at a more reasonable price therefore bringing the price down to normal levels


[12-Dec-24 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	If supply is too high the price will lower in order to increase demand, if the demand is too high the price will raise to decrease demand


[12-Dec-24 01:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	If nobody is buying that's low demand and high supply, so the price crashes


[12-Dec-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	pretty sure everyone here knows that


[12-Dec-24 02:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, but I'm afraid of a positive feedback loop there


[12-Dec-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You pull this thing once, make a profit


[12-Dec-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You have money for more


[12-Dec-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	And more


[12-Dec-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	And more


[12-Dec-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	but then other people can try to predict your move and stockpile, to make more money than you do next time you pull this off


[12-Dec-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Problems start at the "make a profit" stage


[12-Dec-24 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	what lowstrife does, basically


[12-Dec-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	What positive feedback loop? Eventually supply will dry up, you can only produce a finite amount of FLX in a set amount of time, and if nobody is buying because nobody can afford to buy it there's no profit


[12-Dec-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	FLX in particular has a pretty elastic demand, because you can make similar recipes without it depending on FLX price


[12-Dec-24 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	The entire real world works on an open market, if there was such things as a positive feedback loop in an open market then the world would collapse


[12-Dec-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, there is a positive feedback loop in the real world, and antitrust law was designed specifically to combat it


[12-Dec-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Exactly, if FLX is priced too high then people switch to the recipes that don't use FLX, which means demand is 0, no profit is made, so price must fall


[12-Dec-24 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	@atomic which thing on the open market in the real world has a positive feedback loop?


[12-Dec-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	@AtomicScience antitrust is only needed because companies use their monopoly in producing some products against customers; but this doesn't apply here because everything is a commodity


[12-Dec-24 02:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	There is also that


[12-Dec-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	(the basis for anti-trust in the US is "hurting customers", and in the EU it's "using monopoly in a market to gain an advantage in an other market)


[12-Dec-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Anyone here can produce anything, everything is a commodity and nobody has a monopoly


[12-Dec-24 02:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, maybe we all are customers here, since everyone is into PrUn for the fun of it


[12-Dec-24 02:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Atomic, we are also all producers, there's nothing in the game to tell you that you can't produce your own FLX and list it for less than the current ask


[12-Dec-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	the real customers are the friends we made along the way


[12-Dec-24 02:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You get bogged down into the narrow definition of a monopoly as a single buyer. It's not necessarily about someone controlling 100% of the market


[12-Dec-24 02:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Why can't it be about someone abusing market like this?


[12-Dec-24 02:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	"Anticompetitive practice", that's the term

***Bossman3747** left.*


[12-Dec-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	you're referring to price gouging, and that's (unfortunately) legal in the real world


[12-Dec-24 02:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	(most of the time)


[12-Dec-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	The point is that in this game the price has to fall, people will just use the non-FLX recipe until price drops low enough that the FLX recipe makes more than the non-FLX recipe again, or they will produce their own FLX, or people that already produce FLX will list it at progressively lower prices, the price will fall, that is a guarantee of the open market


[12-Dec-24 02:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	remember when some people bought loads of hydroalcoholic gel early in covid?


[12-Dec-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, that's a market panic, completely different phenomenon


[12-Dec-24 02:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	except they made a profit, because they predicted the increased demand


[12-Dec-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	it's a recurring issue with concert tickets too


[12-Dec-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Same thing here, just simulated, people rushed to buy up the whole market of FLX and then people started trying to charge way too much for it, so people won't buy it anymore and in turn price will fall to increase demand


[12-Dec-24 02:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, tickets are more relevant


[12-Dec-24 02:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	I sold overpriced FLX to $BMBL :)


[12-Dec-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	If I tried to sell Taylor Swift concert tickets for 10K I'd pretty soon discover a very little amount of demand for it and I'd have to sell them for less in order to sell them before the concert


[12-Dec-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	made half a million in a single day


[12-Dec-24 02:20 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	But what if you bought out all the tickets for the concert?


[12-Dec-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	that's kind of what scalpers do


[12-Dec-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	(or try to)


[12-Dec-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Atomic, then either I sell them lower or the concert has no people attending it


[12-Dec-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	but there's enough scalpers they still need to compete with each other, i guess


[12-Dec-24 02:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	yeah, that too


[12-Dec-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, what if you sell them not for 10k, but for whatever their cost is x2? Sounds like a plan


[12-Dec-24 02:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	I'd be under time pressure to sell the tickets before the concert otherwise they are worthless


[12-Dec-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, scalpers are still not quite the example, because they operate independently, and also in the areas where they know there will be deficit


[12-Dec-24 02:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Sure I could try and sell them for twice market value but I'd still see a decreased demand and I'm still under time pressure to sell the tickets before the concert


[12-Dec-24 02:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Same thing here, people with FLX are under pressure to sell the FLX before nobody uses the FLX recipes anymore


[12-Dec-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Indeed, market will self-regulate, in a matter of time, though


[12-Dec-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	In that time window, profits can be madee


[12-Dec-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Not necessarily


[12-Dec-24 02:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Not by chargin 5k for a piece of FLX, but with a little more finesse


[12-Dec-24 02:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	If demand remains 0 then no profit will be made until the market has self regulated


[12-Dec-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, dont get fixated on a specific FLX commodity, what if this practice is pulled on, idk, SIO?


[12-Dec-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Good luck replacing that


[12-Dec-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	And you cant scale its production up as quick as CHPs


[12-Dec-24 02:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Find a planet that has SIO, use an extractor to make your own


[12-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	You are not forced to buy anything from the market


[12-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Or you can always try find another market where SIO is cheaper


[12-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yeah, you just need to gather prefabs, upgrade an HQ, establish a base, mine SIO and ship it to CX


[12-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	That's days we are talking here


[12-Dec-24 02:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Maybe even a week


[12-Dec-24 02:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	No matter the commodity the price will self regulate, that's the beauty of an open market where everything is anyones game


[12-Dec-24 02:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	And while it 'self-regulates', honest players suffer while grifters earn?


[12-Dec-24 02:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Grifters won't earn though, because people won't buy overpriced commodities


[12-Dec-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, what if FLX was overpriced not 25x, but merely 2x?


[12-Dec-24 02:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	People would still buy it


[12-Dec-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Here I have some bottled water here for $1M, what's your address I'll even ship it straight to your actual real life front door, it's $1M a bottle


[12-Dec-24 02:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Aren't you a Nestle CEO per chance?


[12-Dec-24 02:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	There's still reduced demand at 2X market value, grifters at that point may make a small profit but they will get greedy and try to make even more, and then demand falls even more


[12-Dec-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Or they may not get greedy and play their cards straight?


[12-Dec-24 02:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Would you rather sell 25 units at 100 each or 100 units at 50 each? I know which one I'd pick


[12-Dec-24 02:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	If I have only 25, the choice is obvious


[12-Dec-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Say you have 100 units, and you need to sell them right now, you can either sell 25 of them for 100 each or you can sell all 100 of them for 50 each, which do you do?


[12-Dec-24 02:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
***jeroen.dr** left.*


[12-Dec-24 02:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	The point is the higher the price the lower the demand, at some point if you raise the price the demand gets low enough your profits start to suffer, if you are maximising profits you are then forced to sell at a lower price to ensure you have the demand to shift product as quick as you need to in order to make the most profit you can


[12-Dec-24 02:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, you pulled these numbers out of your shuttle's exhaust anyway, I dont see how this example accomplishes anything


[12-Dec-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Price will always trend towards the point of equilibrium, that is how the open market works, the people listing FLX for 2K each won't make money or as much money as if they had listed lower prices, they have no support from demand


[12-Dec-24 02:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	You keep citing these market rules, they indeed work, on a large scale on a large timeframe, but we don live in an ideal world, do we?


[12-Dec-24 02:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	This game has maybe like dozens of active market players in some commodities, that's really small scale, like medieval village market small scale


[12-Dec-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	I, myself, am like 20th ALO producer in the game, and I only have a single base!


[12-Dec-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	ALO producing base*


[12-Dec-24 02:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	They also work on a small scale, it just might take longer but you can just not trade overpriced commodities


[12-Dec-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	In a long run, yes, you cannot. But in a short timescale, over the span of a couple days, you very much can create an artificial scarcity and profit of it, if you play our cards right


[12-Dec-24 02:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Current FLX situation is not how you do it, by the way


[12-Dec-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Not like they are doing with FLX, price is too high to be worth it so people will just not buy it


[12-Dec-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Yes, this FLX-gate is indeed not how you run a flourishing grifter business


[12-Dec-24 02:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	But in principle, do you agree it can be pulled off?


[12-Dec-24 02:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Sure you can technically make profit by overpricing your goods, but you'd make more with reasonable pricing than you ever will grifting, the open market decentivises grifting by it's very nature


[12-Dec-24 02:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	Well, that would require actually producing them. But grifters just buy low to sell high


[12-Dec-24 02:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If any fairly new players here are at risk of getting ratfucked by the FLX gouge attempt, let me know, I can probably tide a few of you over for a while. Only catch is you'll have to go pick it up at Montem.


[12-Dec-24 02:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**AtomicScience**:	based


[12-Dec-24 03:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I can add my smallish MOR stockpile to that offer.  If you're under 90 days, send me a message.


[12-Dec-24 03:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	I can switch over to the non-FLX recipe as can most if not everyone as long as they aren't producing anything that doesn't have a non-FLX recipe


[12-Dec-24 03:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Producing FE at 17 per day, it's not much but expansion is only a few days away and the snowball will grow


[12-Dec-24 03:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, but this is a temporary blip and it is conceivable that there are some folks early into things who are in a position where running the other recipe can cause a bit of pain, but also don't have significant stockpiles.


[12-Dec-24 03:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	The FLX I produce is basically just a byproduct, so using it to get some newbies out of a pinch seems is a no-brainer.


[12-Dec-24 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Fair enough aha, does seem like a no-brainer when you put it that way, what is it you produce where FLX is a byproduct? I assume a different type of plastic or something


[12-Dec-24 03:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	NS.


[12-Dec-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	And what's that when it's at home?


[12-Dec-24 03:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	My Montem operation is pretty much DDT & NS. Oh, the NS gets shuttled off to become foodstuffs.


[12-Dec-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Ahh ok, and what's DDT?


[12-Dec-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	A problem for bird eggs, but I guess we didn't bring those to space with us.


[12-Dec-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	So you're a farmer?


[12-Dec-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Insecticide used in the production of some high-end crops.


[12-Dec-24 03:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, mostly, at the moment.


[12-Dec-24 03:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Fair enough, I'm a smelter, I just make iron


[12-Dec-24 03:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Dividebyone** joined.*


[12-Dec-24 03:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'll probably set up a smelting operation on Vallis eventually. I picked up a permit as a hedge against being locked out of distant plans by the pop cap. Due to a lot of other expansion I haven't had the logistics capacity to keep up with a SME base here and there's no market for leasing a base out, so it's just been sitting idle.


[12-Dec-24 03:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Got some ships in the production pipeline right now, but it's still among my lowest priorities.


[12-Dec-24 03:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Well if you need some FE for anything I don't mind selling you a little for 95% market, I'll even (attempt to) drop if off at your base for you as a courtesy


[12-Dec-24 03:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Good to know, thanks! Probably not going to take you up on it though -- I had some vague plans for using FE, but as it turns out the other base that would've been involved got leased out.


[12-Dec-24 03:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	It's an open ended offer, and it would be cash on delivery in NCC


[12-Dec-24 03:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	What sort of volume are you talking?


[12-Dec-24 03:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	I make 17 FE a day so it depends on how much you need and when you need it but my single ship max is 62, so 2 ships worth is 124 which would take me about 8 days to gather up, I only have 2 smelters


[12-Dec-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	So 4 days per ships worth, but I don't mind having to do more than 1 trip, all depends on how much you want and how quickly you want it


[12-Dec-24 03:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Those numbers may change as I expand my base


[12-Dec-24 03:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If I come up with something that'd use it, I'd probably just take delivery here on Vallis. Failing that I could likely still pick up shipping, I'll have a sublight WCB shuttle operating in-system by then.


[12-Dec-24 03:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	If you are handling shipping I can do 90% market at 1000t worth per shipment before I start running a little too lean with my storage amounts, currently at least, at max I'll be producing a WCB shuttles worth per day so if you put in the order a day or 2 ahead of when you want it I can drop it off to you at 95% market or you can pick it up from me at 90% market within 26 hours


[12-Dec-24 03:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'll kick around some ideas once things have settled down for me elsewhere, might come up with something. Probably be a month or so though.


[12-Dec-24 03:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Exact production numbers will most likely change between now and then but that just means you get your product sooner, it would still be 95% market for me shipping or 90% market if you collect


[12-Dec-24 03:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, if I come up with a plan that looks good, I'll almost certainly be willing to front any cost associated with buildout if you haven't got the capacity by then.


[12-Dec-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
***Sgt.Skeleton** joined.*


[12-Dec-24 04:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	If you front buildout I'm giving you free FE until the buildout is paid off, and I will be tracking everything my end so I'll know how much I owe you and how many units that equates to, as long as you don't mind me working at like 90% capacity in terms of what I can provide you so I can still make some money on the side for fuel costs and repairs


[12-Dec-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sgt.Skeleton**:	hi


[12-Dec-24 04:03 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Wouldn't have a problem with that, seems like a pretty decent way to go about it.


[12-Dec-24 04:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CyberKrakenOriginal**:	Fair enough


[12-Dec-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Tch. This guy, taking up a Vallis plot and not immediately building it out. How despicable.


[12-Dec-24 04:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

[12-Dec-24 04:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**MagnusFaustus**:	looks like someone is speculating heavily on the price of Flux on the exchange.


[16-Dec-24 04:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yep, been going on for a couple days.


[16-Dec-24 04:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	On that note, if any newbies are getting squeezed by FLX prices, sing out before you go making any purchases.


[16-Dec-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I miss the 150-200 NCC price range.. this 2000 nonsense seems positively ludicrous.


[16-Dec-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	It is.


[16-Dec-24 04:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I'll sell at 175 for any new player that needs it, but my stock is limited.


[16-Dec-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Hopefully the providers will respect requests within the normal price range rather than the absurd scalp range


[16-Dec-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	I put a 180 NCC offer on the exchange alongside others because of the times and such


[16-Dec-24 04:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Still.. somebody had to coordinate that buy-up.. Probably an alliance somewhere.


[16-Dec-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	It seems to be only $BMBL


[16-Dec-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Dec-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	they buy all my 1k sell orders across all markets


[16-Dec-24 04:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Must be nice to have that much money to throw around.


[16-Dec-24 04:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JCham**:	they also might be storing it on the cx


[16-Dec-24 04:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Yeah they're offering sales at over 2000


[16-Dec-24 04:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MagnusFaustus**:	Maybe they specialize in producing flux and don't like the lowered prices, so bought the market out as a monopoly play to price-fix.


[16-Dec-24 04:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	doesn't matter whether they're producing or not, it's a gamble either way


[16-Dec-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Doubt they'll be able to keep it up for too long.


[16-Dec-24 04:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	that they can keep the market high long enough that people will desperately buy enough at insane prices to make up for all the FLX they had to buy


[16-Dec-24 04:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	$BMBL isn't even in the top 50 for FLX production


[16-Dec-24 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Sibelius**:	Posted a buy ad for a few flux to try and float through the seculation, if anyone can help out!

[17-Dec-24 09:41 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-24 09:46 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-24 11:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	i just started producing flux, only at about 15 per day right now but plan to keep growing it


[17-Dec-24 11:17 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Dec-24 11:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah, back of the envelope math says I can kick it to about 100u/day for a while without degrading anything I care about.

[29-Dec-24 04:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Wouju**:	once I get more smelters up I could start producing steel with no real issue, though I don't recall if free-license users can trade with other players. I can't use the local market IIRC


[30-Dec-24 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	they can use the CX, though


[30-Dec-24 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Have to do it through the CX. Basic license (lapsed pro) can accept contracts but not initiate them, IIRC.


[30-Dec-24 03:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	correct


[30-Dec-24 03:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	As a player on Basic, you can trade items by setting up shipping contracts on CX markets, then terminate them at the right juncture. A little roundabout, but doable.


[30-Dec-24 03:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	As I have pro I could just sent you a personal contract on Vallis for STL.

[30-Dec-24 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	or as GC


[30-Dec-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	lot into ships, yeah, in various forms


[30-Dec-24 09:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If you are making prefabs there, its the wrong planet for prefabs, plus you should also get yourself up to Prefab MK2s as you can make all b and l fabs with them, and the aluminium they use is lighter


[30-Dec-24 09:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	depends on your business model


[30-Dec-24 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	im number one producer of steel, as such i use up a TON of iron i would produce my own but shipping is just not worth it.


[30-Dec-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Wouju**:	can't just produce the iron on site?


[30-Dec-24 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	You get to a point where the additional permits to scale a site aren't worth it.


[30-Dec-24 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	HQ costs start getting prohibitively expensive around level 20.


[30-Dec-24 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	For instance I'm already looking at into 9 digits just to get the permits necessary to build my next big expansion. Suffice it to say it's going to be a bit, and it tends to push players to farming out production at a point.


[30-Dec-24 01:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	yo @Flinter so ur telling me itd be more profitable for me to do iron and sell to you than doing steel?


[30-Dec-24 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	depending on steel prices but yeah, it can be


[30-Dec-24 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	as for why i dont mine iron here, i did that and was losing money hand over fist so i switched to produce steel here since shipping costs are what kill steels profibility cut that out and it makes a good profit


[30-Dec-24 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	problem is i end up eating up all the available iron right now i only have just under 300 in stock i like keeping a buffer of 1k on hand

[30-Dec-24 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	i always take private trades for less than the 100 stacks since i know starting out its hard to save up that much for a trade


[30-Dec-24 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	every 2 days i produce just under 600 steel so i tend to burn a huge amount of iron and oxygen


[30-Dec-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The most profitable think to smelt is SI, and import all inputs and supplies


[30-Dec-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	On vallis that is


[30-Dec-24 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Sorry, thats number 2, number 1 is S


[30-Dec-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	A 500 base of only 21 Smelters, all producing S, with an inputs purchased, will need you 104k per day without a HQ there or experts. If you have any of them then it goes up.


[30-Dec-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Will make you 1-4k per day*


[30-Dec-24 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Dec-24 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127

[31-Dec-24 10:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**dakota1234**:	either that or you have a big enough cushion to just keep putting things on the market for the same price you did before and hope it'll sell.... eventually

**starWanderer**:	not add, take only


[03-Jan-25 11:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You need to have had at least 1 pro month to accept contracts on the LM


[03-Jan-25 11:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	ya thats what i thought, ill do that when its time for another ship, which is coming soon i think


[03-Jan-25 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	speaking of new ships, what does one cost? one thats a little bigger than the starters?


[03-Jan-25 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	2-3 planets depending on what you ship is the practical limit for 2 basic ships


[03-Jan-25 11:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	There are actually 3 options, not 2 as claimed


[03-Jan-25 11:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	There is a wide hull upgrade 3000/1000 which doubles your hull capacity but allows you to carry x6 the weight


[03-Jan-25 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Or there is 2000/2000


[03-Jan-25 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Or there is the option of just making your ship fly faster to do more deliveries per day by fitting basic high-g seats which is by far the cheapest at 180k


[03-Jan-25 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If you haven't upgraded your start ships, that's going to be your best bet. UFO Discord will have some deals.


[03-Jan-25 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	You can do WCB upgrades on both for half the price of a new ship, and that'll double your cargo capacity (or more, depending on what you're shipping).


[03-Jan-25 11:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	With what you have to buy to go with the UFO discord the cheapest package is the wide hull one - WCB - and in total will cost you about 900k


[03-Jan-25 11:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	oh geeze, well i guess i better start saving. Im on montem and vallis and would want to expand further out for base #3


[03-Jan-25 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	180k for basic-g seats, will knock a 3rd off flight times


[03-Jan-25 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If you're pretty sure you're going to stay in-system, you could also just do a strictly sublight WCB for a fair bit less than the cost of a full new ship.


[03-Jan-25 12:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	That'd free up your two other ships to support extra-system expansion.


[03-Jan-25 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	^ 600k


[03-Jan-25 12:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	i think the g seats may be enough


[03-Jan-25 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	is that something i can do only with basic +


[03-Jan-25 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	?


[03-Jan-25 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Oh, you cant do any upgrades without pro


[03-Jan-25 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	but you can do an upgrade while on pro, then go back to basic and keep it


[03-Jan-25 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	oh maybe better to save up for a whole new ship then


[03-Jan-25 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	i still need to decide what to expand to next anyway, lots of time to figure it out now


[03-Jan-25 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Danakil, Verdant, Sand


[03-Jan-25 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Dont put too much distance between planets if you have 2 basic ships


[03-Jan-25 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Try to claim them in 1 or 2 systems right next door to each other


[03-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	All of those are. Dan is 6-8 hrs to MOR, Snd is 10-12 hrs to MOR, Verdant is 22-24 hrs to MOR, but if you do a rotation its 14-16 from Verdant to Sand


[03-Jan-25 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	I will actully probably do Arcadia next, need more SME. Thanks for the suggestion


[03-Jan-25 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(which is farther out than verdant)


[03-Jan-25 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Awesome planet


[03-Jan-25 01:22 PM] ApexChat#8127

**boom_badda_boom**:	I need faster FTL


[03-Jan-25 01:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	That is an issue, yeah


[03-Jan-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Every building on Sabaton will need INS and HSE. Every building that needs to be repaired will need INS and HSE. That will be a significant drain on your revenue


[03-Jan-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	its pocket money


[03-Jan-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I`ll have made 4+ million this week


[03-Jan-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Then why not just move the fuell sliders all the way to the right?


[03-Jan-25 01:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The expense is doable


[03-Jan-25 01:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I have 1 basic ship and 1 WCB, I`m not in the position to be going far


[03-Jan-25 01:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I`m not going near verdant until the end of the month


[03-Jan-25 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	When I have 3 WCB I`ll pop a better FTL and FTL fuel on one, then do it


[03-Jan-25 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	You have the credits available. Why not do the Enhanced WCB that comes with the LFL and MSL (roughly 900k-1m iirc) That will gives your ships 5x the range


[03-Jan-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Ahhh ok


[03-Jan-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You mean turn the basic one into that

**Isoroku**:	Yes


[03-Jan-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

[03-Jan-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Isoroku**:	Thats what I plan to do to free up one of my main ships


[03-Jan-25 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Nah, I get 3 WCB with one having the FTL upgrades


[03-Jan-25 01:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, it can be helpful if you enough bases in a single system


[03-Jan-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	What's a WCB cost these days?


[03-Jan-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I mean the full ship not the part


[03-Jan-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	With the extra parts about 900k


[03-Jan-25 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The full ship, pff, I dont know, 4 mill?


[03-Jan-25 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	4.4


[03-Jan-25 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	That sounds about right


[03-Jan-25 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	big number


[03-Jan-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Within my means


[03-Jan-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	meh I should quit reading chat, now I am looking into Basic G seats >.<


[03-Jan-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	lol


[03-Jan-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	The nice thing about them is that you can pretty much bolt 'em on after the fact without too much trouble, if you're in for repairs anyway.


[03-Jan-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	At least I think so.


[03-Jan-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Also, weirdly, AGS can actually lower the max speed of a ship in certain configurations.


[03-Jan-25 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	You can. It night even be worth it on a STL only inner system WCB if it cuts off 1/3 ish off the travel time.


[03-Jan-25 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Depends on how close the target planet is too, the closer the better the time saving


[03-Jan-25 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I have my doubts, but mostly because having a dedicated sublight ship in a system tends to mean you can slow-boat it regularly anyway.


[03-Jan-25 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Guess it'd be nice if you realize you forgot something and really, really want that second run done yesterday.


[03-Jan-25 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The advanced high g-seats would be nice, but at the time there were only 3 across all CXs on sale


[03-Jan-25 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	And I couldnt get there so settled for basic


[03-Jan-25 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	STL (both in system and on long-haul flights) adjustments above the 50% tick rarely give any significant speed benefit - I generally max FTL, half STL, unless I'm configuring arrival for a specific time.


[03-Jan-25 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but ship configs come into play as well


[03-Jan-25 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	in an unmodified starter, Verdant is 17h from Moria at top speed


[03-Jan-25 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Hmmm


[03-Jan-25 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	iirc


[03-Jan-25 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	haven't had a starter in a while


[03-Jan-25 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Yeah. Unfortunately the way a lot of components work tends to make them less useful than they would appear at a glance.


[03-Jan-25 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	currently running two upgraded starters (wcb), two ROF LCB's (FSE/QCR), and two GEN stl-only in system MCB's


[03-Jan-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Probably. I usually only use the STL slider to try and hit that weird spot. Once my Fuel Refining base is up I will probably just cram a bunch of endangered owls into the tank as fuel and slide them sliders all the way to the right


[03-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	MCB's are getting upgraded to FTL (QCR) soon along with the addition of a third, and two HIghlander LCB's due in Feb.


[03-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Not really worth the extra burn.


[03-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Even with real cheap fuel.


[03-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	^^^


[03-Jan-25 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	I just recently put together 2 SFE-based sublight only ships. Guess I could've went GEN and saved some money, but the upshot is that if I do decide I need speed dropping in BGSes will give it a good kick.


[03-Jan-25 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Based on how my Hortus one is working out, I doubt I'll need it though.

[04-Jan-25 07:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Depends on what you want to do on the planet


[04-Jan-25 07:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	at 2 hours in, highly recommend starting with the tutorials


[04-Jan-25 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Vallis is a metallurgy world, so your starting build is likely going to include EXT for the FEO and SME to process it. The water, oxygen and hydrogen yields are so low that it would be more cost-effective to buy those at the cx


[04-Jan-25 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and though it's "fertile", the fertility has a negative modifier, so efficiency starts sub-100....not worth it to farm here.

**Malinko**:	I have run the numbers, it is more cost effective to buy H2O and H but not O. I also farm to produce Carbon needed for 2 bases in this system. Way cheaper than buying it at Moria station


[06-Jan-25 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Depends


[06-Jan-25 12:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Would a different buildings be making your more?


[06-Jan-25 12:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	difference between starting here and adding the base here as #17 - my 1-permit build is all metallurgy: FS, GF, & SME


[06-Jan-25 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Smelt the most profitable ore


[06-Jan-25 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	glass is not metallurgy


[06-Jan-25 12:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	a glass furnace is metallurgy


[06-Jan-25 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	if i had more bases, and could specialize a bit more, I would.


[06-Jan-25 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Well what do you know glass is on the list


[06-Jan-25 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	xD


[06-Jan-25 12:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	SIO + NA


[06-Jan-25 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you'll get there


[06-Jan-25 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	we all started with non-specialized bases at some point


[06-Jan-25 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	some more convoluted than others


[06-Jan-25 12:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	The thing about NA is it is available in huge quantities for very cheap since as a byproduct it is usually just dumped on the MM


[06-Jan-25 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have two chem bases pumping CL, so plenty of NA by-product


[06-Jan-25 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	how is the glass market though?


[06-Jan-25 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	you move through a lot of it?


[06-Jan-25 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Exactly


[06-Jan-25 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	After someone brought a staggering amount yesterday, doing well


[06-Jan-25 12:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I just started this base....was doing GL mostly for conversion to TUB for infrastructure support since I dabble in governance


[06-Jan-25 12:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	GL.NC1


[06-Jan-25 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	considering it's only costing me fuel and workforce cons, I'd say the surplus GL market is fine


[06-Jan-25 12:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	sure if your using it to burn up waste anyway i guess


[06-Jan-25 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	2 SIO + 1 NA = 10 GL


[06-Jan-25 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	even if I were buying the components it would be profitable


[06-Jan-25 12:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	SIO.IC1


[06-Jan-25 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	scratch that, SIO.CI1


[06-Jan-25 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	cheapest in Benten


[06-Jan-25 12:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	235.10 input yields 4950


[06-Jan-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	or thereabouts


[06-Jan-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Or if you have a FP base on Sand just throw a few EXT there. It will fill any empty space not used for RAT DW COF


[06-Jan-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I have an EXT for SIO on the base I just dropped at XG-430b


[06-Jan-25 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	and can buy it cheap on Etherwind LM, have a base there.


[06-Jan-25 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	LTA is 3800 ish . GL is not a bad product


[06-Jan-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Especially if you need CL anyway


[06-Jan-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my three FP bases are exclusively FP, incliding Sand


[06-Jan-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	what is FP?


[06-Jan-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I only produce CL for cash, no labs


[06-Jan-25 12:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	food processor


[06-Jan-25 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	same ext planet generates LST for NS, HAL for CL/NA, and FEO


[06-Jan-25 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	thats sand?


[06-Jan-25 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	I do need to get into CL at some point


[06-Jan-25 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	Sand, Avalon and Epicier are all Food Industry cogc, so loaded with fp for me - rat, dw, cof


[06-Jan-25 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Sand is  great world, much better than I thought it would be. Just like what I thought about Danakil in the beginning. For some reason I thought travel between systems would just be longer, but it can sometimes be even faster than intra syatem travel on certain routes


[06-Jan-25 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	what system is sand in?


[06-Jan-25 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I hear they have a cool governor too


[06-Jan-25 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	wb-675c


[06-Jan-25 01:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	>.<


[06-Jan-25 01:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	couldn't resist


[06-Jan-25 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	You do good work. I'm sure you hear that a lot. Much appreciated


[06-Jan-25 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	but that planet has no fertility


[06-Jan-25 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	so you grow the crops elsewhere and bring them to sand? or just buy them?


[06-Jan-25 01:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	That is why the aAgricultural products are grown on Verdant


[06-Jan-25 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	O sale ads up - STL buy ads up


[06-Jan-25 01:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Prices on Ag products on MOR can be wonky.


[06-Jan-25 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	You can get much cheaper On promitor but then you have to deal with ICA and currency exchange


[06-Jan-25 01:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Zugore I went the CF and SOI route, but may look into glass for those times CF and SOI demand drops


[06-Jan-25 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	I'm actually thinking about COLIQ just to get Prom since Montem and Vallis had have open spots recently


[06-Jan-25 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Vallis first


[06-Jan-25 01:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its the one thats normally full


[06-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You`ll miss prom though


[06-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Prom is always full. There will never be an open plot until they reset the universe again


[06-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Prom first


[06-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	Yes


[06-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	That is what the ocd voices in my head keep saying


[06-Jan-25 01:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	stupid voices


[06-Jan-25 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yikes, throwing away 2 years of work and 11 bases (and how many ships?) for a base on Prom? Plety of fertile planets around


[06-Jan-25 01:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	only 2 shipd though i have the parts for 2 in sto. thats why i havent built them yet


[06-Jan-25 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you cant take it with you


[06-Jan-25 01:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	nah ill get a corp mate to hold what stuff can be salvaged


[06-Jan-25 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	not sure, but that might look like pushing


[06-Jan-25 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Sell it all, transfer the money to me, I`ll keep 5% and reinburse the rest


[06-Jan-25 01:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	it is certainly not the brightest or cost efficient thing to do


[06-Jan-25 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	its just my ocd saying hey you know what would be great and even better, a base on prom.


[06-Jan-25 01:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you would completely liquidate all buildings, mats, everything....then just xfr the cash and get it back later


[06-Jan-25 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	you have voices too? yeah that is what they say. you have the money, everything will take a little time. go on, do it


[06-Jan-25 01:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	a global undertaking in and of itself


[06-Jan-25 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my voices say don't violate the contracts I have


[06-Jan-25 01:17 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	5 pending ships ordered, base supply contract, weekly direct sales contracts


[06-Jan-25 01:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	staring from scratch is not appealing to me at this point, I'm still new


[06-Jan-25 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I think they could do with a couple more planets because otherwise new starters end up somewhere challenging


[06-Jan-25 01:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	triple green planets


[06-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	I don't know how the devs are going to have stargates in the hortus system. is a SHY required in the same system a SG is built in?


[06-Jan-25 01:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	And you need 2 right, 1 going out and 1 coming back in


[06-Jan-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you need two gates for each connection, avalon to boucher for example, requires a dedicated gate at each planet (it's like dialing the stargate like on the tv show where any gate can connect to any other)


[06-Jan-25 01:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	not like the tv show


[06-Jan-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	are they permanently linked together? could that same gate in hor dial into a gate in mor?


[06-Jan-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	don't think so, besides there's a 25 parsec limit


[06-Jan-25 01:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there's no dialing, the pair is linked


[06-Jan-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I saw a pipe-dream plan somewhere (likely discord), hrt to mor requires a stop in the middle like LB system or OZ. The cool thing will be BEN to HRT since that will essentially cross the middle (where there are no planets)


[06-Jan-25 01:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	hmmm so a link from mor to hub is 155 parsecs lol


[06-Jan-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	awfully expensive for access to an undeveloped country, though it would be a great way to get it more densely populated - though with the 6B price tag for the pair, yikes


[06-Jan-25 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	even verdant to pb-519a is 92 parsecs flight time is usually 1d 22h ish


[06-Jan-25 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	that's a lot of credits to just save time


[06-Jan-25 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I've been wondering if/when they're going to add in the infrastructure elements (the new fuel required and the recipes/facilities for that) - and wondering if that's going to be a third fuel/engine system for the ships or if that's going to be a function of the gate itself?


[06-Jan-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yeah, HUB is just going to remain a long-haul LCB run


[06-Jan-25 01:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	let me see if i can find the screenshots. i believe there is a 3rd fuel and engine system


[06-Jan-25 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	so there will be a new ship type likely, gateway transit ships....no ftl or stl, just shuttles to move stuff back and forth....a budding new transport industry

**Pauchu**:	Hey, so I've been curious, how much fuel do you guys put on your ships? I personally only put like 200 on for a trip to CX, so I can more precisely control fuel usage.


[16-Jan-25 03:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I keep both SF and FF above 1k, every time it's below and I'm at refueling place, I put another 1k in


[16-Jan-25 03:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	So that I don't get stranded somewhere


[16-Jan-25 03:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	But if your ship is doing just MOR <-> Vallis, and you keep fuel at both ends, you can fuel it just enough, and it will work


[16-Jan-25 03:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I personally don't see much use in fine control of that, it's either "Yeah, I will be online when ship lands" or "Nope, I will be offline when ship lands"

**boom_badda_boom**:	Thanks for the ALO, that should keep me going a day


[16-Jan-25 05:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	np, ask me more


[16-Jan-25 05:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	How many ALO do you have just out of interest?


[16-Jan-25 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	6,5 k at all


[16-Jan-25 05:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	no, 7k


[16-Jan-25 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	We could come to a regular agreement


[16-Jan-25 05:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I burn through about 200 a day, and soon that will increase to about 500


[16-Jan-25 05:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I need a daily supplier of at least 200 a day for this week, otherwise my lfab production will stop


[16-Jan-25 05:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	Im trying not to sell resources. When I made same more from it - I will take much more money.


[16-Jan-25 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Well if your plan is smelters too, I have nothing against buying AL so long as its 900-950 pu max


[16-Jan-25 05:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I also need FE and SI


[16-Jan-25 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	and STL, lots of STL


[16-Jan-25 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I have just had to focus on AL for the time being as I`m not paying moria prices


[16-Jan-25 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	:) Im not sell AL, its need to make prefabs


[16-Jan-25 05:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	STL too, and also PT


[16-Jan-25 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Mine all goes into b, l, and r fabs


[16-Jan-25 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Soon I will add a fabs too


[16-Jan-25 05:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	you have smelters - you have all metals. You need a little math to discover, that you will have money even you will buy all resources. If you have to by one rosource - you will take more, if you can to produce all resources - much more


[16-Jan-25 05:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The issue is getting the ore here, and getting the metal over to danakil, seeing as I cannot really by importing AL from moria


[16-Jan-25 05:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	I was going this way. Its not issue.


[16-Jan-25 05:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**starWanderer**:	and you also have a base on Montem. I was buying all my LST ))


[16-Jan-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I dont extract anything


[16-Jan-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I only make


[16-Jan-25 05:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Maybe thats the real issue here


[16-Jan-25 06:07 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Ravick**:	Infinite :)


[17-Jan-25 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**567976**:	hmmm


[17-Jan-25 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**567976**:	at what price?


[17-Jan-25 08:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	MOR CX bid


[17-Jan-25 08:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**567976**:	1650?


[17-Jan-25 08:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**567976**:	i dont produce a lot, i'm pretty new


[17-Jan-25 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**567976**:	but i could get like 20 STL in about a week?


[17-Jan-25 08:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Got it- well, if you decide to go pro then we could do contracts and make this thing work


[17-Jan-25 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**567976**:	yeah i cant afford pro


[17-Jan-25 08:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**567976**:	sorry


[17-Jan-25 08:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CraftsmanThirteen**:	What are you making Ravick?  I doubt its PT


[17-Jan-25 08:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	R-fabs mostly


[17-Jan-25 08:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	*checks LEAD* you're not kidding around with those numbers


[17-Jan-25 08:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, I need a lot of STL so I'm always looking for it


[17-Jan-25 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	~120 STL per day by the looks of it, very impressive


[17-Jan-25 08:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yep, that's the number I need


[17-Jan-25 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Wont that crash the r fab price?


[17-Jan-25 08:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I use it for Afabs mostly


[17-Jan-25 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You are single handledly supressing a fab prices


[17-Jan-25 08:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I don't know about singlehandedly


[17-Jan-25 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	True, 10 people doing that would be


[17-Jan-25 08:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I make a lot of ABH, ADE and ASE but a bunch of that goes to HQ upgrades


[17-Jan-25 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Ah yeah, that must eat them up like crazy


[17-Jan-25 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	661 ABH for the upcoming HQ upgrade


[17-Jan-25 08:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	The day Fire stops upgrading HQ's is the day A-Fab prices crash


[17-Jan-25 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	That's true


[17-Jan-25 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	37 bases will do that


[17-Jan-25 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, that's the game though :)


[17-Jan-25 08:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	think I'm at 18


[17-Jan-25 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	that's awesome


[17-Jan-25 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	But you're a close second, based on Lead, you're actually matching pace with Fire on A-Fabs? damn


[17-Jan-25 08:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, I just expanded Afab production, gotta push some more to overtake


[17-Jan-25 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	if it's even possible


[17-Jan-25 08:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	I don't do any IDC/ EDC bases, so I don't really have anything else to grow


[17-Jan-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	17, I just killed one the other day (ice water is horribly inefficient on a 1-permit base)


[17-Jan-25 08:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Yea, that makes sense


[17-Jan-25 08:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**realbandit**:	If the devs nerf EDC/IDC much more, you'll be well ahead of the pack Ravick. Too many of us rely on it too much lol


[17-Jan-25 08:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Based on the current prices the IDC/EDC things really does work so it makes sense to use just not something I've done


[17-Jan-25 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	almost ready to drop one of those, just not doing it with a loan.


[17-Jan-25 08:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	very nice


[17-Jan-25 08:48 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-25 03:19 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	There is an oversupply and yet the price is so high


[17-Jan-25 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	AL.AI1


[17-Jan-25 03:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Welp... we're screwed


[17-Jan-25 03:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	20 smelters on AL, production has increased, but I still need to get first batch of increased output to danakil


[17-Jan-25 03:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	I guess I should prepare for new bases on YI-059b


[17-Jan-25 03:28 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Jan-25 06:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	i just dropped 3 base permits on YI-059b pop is a bit low there so you might have to wait a bit to fill your base fully but i think it was well worth it

[18-Jan-25 08:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Obscene numbers


[18-Jan-25 08:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	(full 1-permit build-out, plus 1-mo provisions, plus an SST with inputs and a WH level)


[18-Jan-25 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	darn TSH was 1.6M


[18-Jan-25 08:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I wish I could stock bases for a month, mine tend to be 1-2 days


[18-Jan-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	being spread out like I am, there's no way I could provision each base that frequently


[18-Jan-25 08:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Makes sense


[18-Jan-25 08:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	any time I plan a base though I factor that into the initial cost


[18-Jan-25 08:59 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-25 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-25 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-25 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-25 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	xD


[18-Jan-25 09:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its my plan, get some vassals


[18-Jan-25 09:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	hence the ever-evolving fleet....I do provide base supply services on a contractual basis - to alleviate those shipping hassles for clients.


[18-Jan-25 09:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I have been known to use shippers its normally FireyFerret and Retread


[18-Jan-25 09:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I occasionally employ LM shippers, and more rarely take LM contracts myself - though I used to be a very active LM shipper (but since my real estate has sprawled, that had to change)


[18-Jan-25 09:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It doesnt look that profitable shipping for other people, unless its between distance planets


[18-Jan-25 09:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	there are a few lucrative corridors, and a few folks that pay very well.


[18-Jan-25 09:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	When I post them, my ads never sit more than a day on an LM. (I also know who the big boy shippers are and where they operate, so generally send them a DM to let them know I've posted ads)

[18-Jan-25 01:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	LAST UNIVERSE? there has been more than one iteration?


[18-Jan-25 01:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yeah, but considering the oldest players in here are nearly 4 years old....it's been a while


[18-Jan-25 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It wouldnt be so bad so long as each player got credits equal to their current worth


[18-Jan-25 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	The scale is not optimised for scale, I mean can you imagine the headache someone has with 20 planets?


[18-Jan-25 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	the universe just explodes?


[18-Jan-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	but what am i doing all this planning for if one day it just expodes


[18-Jan-25 01:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	explodes


[18-Jan-25 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	new uni, new challenges - exploration goes into effect (you actually have to discover what's on the planets) - so startup will be slower, no older players with wads of cash to dole out loans...doubtful it'll happen anytime soon, since attrition peaks during such things


[18-Jan-25 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	I imagine when the power/energy update is ready there will be a wipe, since that will have such game and economy broad implications during anything else other than a full wipe would be weird


[18-Jan-25 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	by the time you hit 20 planets, you're used to it and having fun doing it, it's not a headache


[18-Jan-25 01:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If they do wipe I want my credits


[18-Jan-25 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	I'm a former Tarkov player so I'm very much used to wipes. XD


[18-Jan-25 01:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I imagine player credits (real-world licenses/$) would remain/transfer - in game stuff not so much - it'd be a universal coliq


[18-Jan-25 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	That would be annoying, all that hard work lost


[18-Jan-25 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it'd be essentially a new game though, with new challenges added.


[18-Jan-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	As annoying at it would be, I'd love to experience being at the beginning of a new galaxy :D


[18-Jan-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	They need planet terraformng


[18-Jan-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I imagine the corporation wars would be included with that update too


[18-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	But yeah, to Zugore's point - there would be enough new mechanics that it would essentially feel like a different, more expansive version


[18-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	but we've still got to see the implementation of the gateways, and whatever other changes are slated for this iteration....so we've got time


[18-Jan-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	oh but to explore the young economy as it matures from nothing into a cut throat capitalist utopia


[18-Jan-25 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I do think the commies, the fundies, the goose steppers, and monarchists, and all other ideologies should have their area of space

[18-Jan-25 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Jan-25 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	could I start an anarcho-syndicalist commune? with a preference for meat popsicles?


[18-Jan-25 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Cyrup**:	Running your base would require energy, there would be different energy generation methods depending on the planet and would be an additional thing you would need to think about for base planning and operations


[18-Jan-25 01:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yes, power like electricity - which at present is universally free - it would be a planetary upkeep sorta thing


[18-Jan-25 01:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FireyFerret**:	hmm. this has been a mind altering learning moment for me, I will have meditate on this wisdom. good day all

**Cyrup**:	o7


[18-Jan-25 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	You know what would be fun next wipe? If the different factions were separated and could only be linked via gateways


[18-Jan-25 01:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	There could be "temporary" gateways for the start of the wipe, or passages between factions that fade over time - eventually necessitating the need for gateways to be constructed


[18-Jan-25 01:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	It'd also tie in well with whatever faction politics/tarriff gameplay they have planned, as it'd create controllable chokepoints.

**boom_badda_boom**:	How would space war work?


[18-Jan-25 01:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It would be far more fun if it was pew pew style


[18-Jan-25 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	It'd probably be more economical controls than actual pew pew. Or a system can be flipped via some mechanism where both sides contribute resources to the war effort (for pay)


[18-Jan-25 02:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	The devs had said that in no instance will anyone lose any bases/ships they have, so it's not going to be like EVE


[18-Jan-25 02:05 PM] ApexChat#8127

**NgURoyalZ**:	if anyone here needs a stockpile of flux of up to 2k just hit me up. Times may wary because of ongoing productions. i would offer it @ whatever the current market price is to a lower cap of 100NCC/u.


[20-Jan-25 02:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	for the full 2k it would take 6d17h + however long i have to wait on currently running productions. 1k would be 3d8h and so on.


[20-Jan-25 02:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	once my last expert moves in it would go down to 6d5h. dont expect that to happen soon tho

**Isoroku**:	Yes. I run 3x EXT, 4x INC, 10x SME. It may not be the most efficient or profitable, but I am pretty well insulated from market swings and manipulation, for the most part. And if you end up with a surplus, C sells very well on the CX. You could even just drop it on the LM, and as long as the price isn't crazy, someone will snap it up quickly

[28-Jan-25 02:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	As a very rough guestimate considering what is going on with Ag products on the CX, 1x GRN, 1x MAI, 2x HCP @ 400/u costs 1600 credits, which makes 4 C that goes for 750 credits each or 3,000 credits. You almost double the profit, or another way is you gain twice as much C than just buying it off the CX

**FireyFerret**:	You really put to much thought into US politics. The rich want to stay rich and expand access to power (what ever its form). what makes them left or right is the method they feel will best allow them to achieve those goals. It only seems difficult if you pay more attention what they blame for your problems instead of what is quietly being done

**josel**:	Hi, I'm quite new to the game - two days, means I've just started production with extractor and smelter


[29-Jan-25 11:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	When the extractor has finished, goods will be in the inventory, but in the smelter the stuff is ready but doesn't leave the queue


[29-Jan-25 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	Anything I have to do...or shouldn't have done?


[29-Jan-25 11:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	(still a bit overwhelmed with all the possible options)


[29-Jan-25 11:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	FE in the smelter is at 100% since 38 minutes


[29-Jan-25 11:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Pizzzaaa**:	@josel is there room in your inventory for the FE?


[29-Jan-25 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	I have a Vol. of 102 of 1500 and a weight of 254 of 1500


[29-Jan-25 12:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	I thougt about that too and loaded some inventories in a ship - but that didn't do the trick


[29-Jan-25 12:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	something happened and the smelter is now empty.


[29-Jan-25 12:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	Thank you very much :)


[29-Jan-25 12:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pizzzaaa**:	Must just be a bug


[29-Jan-25 12:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	Maybe the FE-Transporter had a flat tire and was just in the workshop :)


[29-Jan-25 12:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**bobnobrain**:	Might also be an issue with system clock or something


[29-Jan-25 01:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**josel**:	could be possible, because exactly after one hour the FE was in the Inventory, but in the extractor everything works as expected


[29-Jan-25 01:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

**CordEins**:	have i to wait 15h to produce my first iron? Is there anything useful to make in this time?


[14-Feb-25 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	It's an idle/incremental game - designed to be checked on regular occassion, not binged. In not certain on the production time for iron (on mobile) but yeah, that can be the case


[14-Feb-25 09:21 AM] ApexChat#8127

[14-Feb-25 09:24 AM] ApexChat#8127
**pfeifenson**:	At the beginning you don’t have that much to do. Just learn the mechanics, and try to understand how the game works. Later you have more then enough to do, like thinking about expansion and production chains


[14-Feb-25 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**CordEins**:	Is it allowed to mod the UI with Javsscript? I will see the time when a project is finished and not the duration.


[14-Feb-25 09:25 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Cyrup**:	You should look into RPrun.


[14-Feb-25 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-25 09:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	wow.  That's not even one big buy, just the price slowly increasing as the supply dries.  That price could be up there for a while.


[18-Feb-25 09:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I must say, I timed my entry into the RAT market almost perfectly.  Totally not by accident...


[18-Feb-25 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	XD


[18-Feb-25 09:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i got a sense of supply drying up but i wasnt really worried tbh


[18-Feb-25 09:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i thought to myself "well it LOOKS like its getting pretty low but i mean.. its RAT. no ways its gonna empty"


[18-Feb-25 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	VEG.NC1 has also been dry for a few days now.


[18-Feb-25 09:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Nothing on the shelves


[18-Feb-25 09:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	MAI.NC1 is quite low


[18-Feb-25 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	what im wondering is how that would even happen in a game like this. im used to "starter" mats or "low lvl" mats being absolutly empty in other mmos bc the playerbase just progresses past them


[18-Feb-25 09:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	but that cant really happen here


[18-Feb-25 09:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It was cheap for long enough that it made more sense to buy than grow your own.  Plus FRMs and HYFs are easily transitioned, so maybe there's a lot of them growing GRN, HCP and MAI for the incinerators.


[18-Feb-25 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	wait is there really only one recipe of RAT that doesnt use any HYF only products


[18-Feb-25 09:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i never really looked at them closely before


[18-Feb-25 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	Nah, there's more.


[18-Feb-25 09:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	GRN/BEA/VEG or NUT at least, just from memory.


[18-Feb-25 09:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	The four BEA-based recipes can all be made from farms only


[18-Feb-25 09:49 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-25 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Feb-25 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	MAi and GRN have been steadily increasing for a while now


[18-Feb-25 09:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	wdym Isoroku ? im running that one currently on Verdant and am doing just fine.


[18-Feb-25 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	You probably are not feed a 500 m3 base on Sand as well


[18-Feb-25 09:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	granted im completely selfsustained on that base. not taking workforce upkeep into account


[18-Feb-25 09:55 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	I only mentioned the price, my Verdant base is 1000 m3. Sometimes I need to buy from the CX, so I only noticed it in passing. Specifically when there was no VEG on the MOR CX for days


[18-Feb-25 10:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	Retread. the recipes are one of the main reason i didnt go with FP at the very start. Metallurgy spoke to my soul. Im a simple man. put ore in oven get back metal. me happy


[18-Feb-25 10:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Isoroku**:	I do the ALG/MAI/VEG for RAT and HCP/GRN/MAI for my INC with my production skewed to making C. Usually you can find ALG or VEG cheap on the MOR CX. So when VEG was unobtainable, I was surprised. Even now seeing FEO for 100+/u on the CX is surprising

**Atrak**:	I think you can only accept them if they allow rating U, so someone would have to make a contract which allows rating U to accept them, I belive the default is P(ending) which you get with PRO/Basic.  (I think that's right.. don't quote me on it though) =)

**boom_badda_boom**:	What went wrong


[15-Mar-25 05:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	You can start over with the COLIQ command in a new buffer.  Beware there's a cooldown between uses that gets longer every time you do it.


[15-Mar-25 05:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FROST19**:	i just started as a mining corp, ad bult the base as the game suggested following the toutorial. Because i can play only on the weekends i did an order that would take a week(280 units of FEO). apparently my base doesn't have enough space for it, it isn't producng and the cost for cancelling the order is 600


[15-Mar-25 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You need a storage


[15-Mar-25 05:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	until then just rent a warehouse, and put the surpluses there


[15-Mar-25 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FROST19**:	how do i do it?(sorry for bothering)


[15-Mar-25 05:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Planet info window, click warehouse, click rent


[15-Mar-25 05:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You need to make a storage building as soon as you can


[15-Mar-25 05:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-25 05:13 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You only need a lv1 warehouse


[15-Mar-25 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FROST19**:	it still says no capacity


[15-Mar-25 05:14 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	production can't go into a warehouse automatically.  Drag something else in there to make room in your base storage.


[15-Mar-25 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Drag and drop your surplus into the warehouse


[15-Mar-25 05:15 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You will need to manually move stuff around until you have a storage, then it all goes in there


[15-Mar-25 05:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Click INV on the left, find your warehouse, open its window, drag what you dont need into it


[15-Mar-25 05:19 PM] ApexChat#8127

**boom_badda_boom**:	It is telling you that your base storage (not your warehouse, but your base storage) is not large enough to take an order of 280 iron ore


[15-Mar-25 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You`ll need to cancel the order


[15-Mar-25 05:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	And queue up smaller ones


[15-Mar-25 05:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**boom_badda_boom**:	how much does it want to cancel?


[15-Mar-25 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	60k?


[15-Mar-25 05:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**FROST19**:	600, i just did it


[15-Mar-25 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Set a 3 day order, and then repeat it again, and again, etc


[15-Mar-25 05:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You`ll need to log in every 3 days and move what you`ve extracted to your warehouse


[15-Mar-25 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[15-Mar-25 05:32 PM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	In the same metal family as sodium, potassium, lithium, caesium, and francium


[16-Mar-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	perhaps from the perspective of a geologist, but us normal people that play games consider calcium/sodium/potassium to be rock derivatives not metals


[16-Mar-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	They are all shiny metals


[16-Mar-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	@Zugore in what way is calcium not a metal?


[16-Mar-25 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Alkali metals like Sodium and Potassium and alkaline earth metals like Calcium are not naturally found in an elemental state, they are always found in compounds that don't look or act like metals.  If the only form you'd ever seen iron in was rust, you wouldn't think of it as a metal either.


[16-Mar-25 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	that's a good point


[16-Mar-25 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Mar-25 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-25 01:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	so don't make your ships go as fast as possible. 12 to 24h for a trip is fine


[17-Mar-25 01:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CHURCHTUARY**:	im going for 16~18 per trip, yeah, but even that would cut massively into my profit


[17-Mar-25 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127

[17-Mar-25 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	I'd suggest upgrading your ships first before considering building new ships


[17-Mar-25 11:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CHURCHTUARY**:	i didnt even know you could upgrade them, nice


[17-Mar-25 11:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**--SCHAITR--**:	If you want to upgrade them to 3kt/1km3, I have a cheaper package for players under 180 days old


[18-Mar-25 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	it sucks right now too bc Vallis and Moria Station are so far apart from eachother


[18-Mar-25 01:39 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Dayzed**:	Moria Station revolves around the star quicker so it should be coming closer to make for quicker round trips soon

**CHURCHTUARY**:	wait what


[18-Mar-25 03:10 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Katt_Tarki**:	I currently have 2 smelters. Is there any way to set one to make iron and the other to make steel?


[18-Mar-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	yes, just add both orders


[18-Mar-25 09:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	Is that something a PRO license would allow, much like the auto renew orders?


[18-Mar-25 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	they'll finish their current job, then alternate


[18-Mar-25 09:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	I get that, as that is what happens when I manually set the orders. I'm on a free account.


[18-Mar-25 09:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	If I purchase a subscription my orders can auto-renew, but there is only one order queue for the 2 smelters.


[18-Mar-25 10:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	Thank you.


[18-Mar-25 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It's better to think of it as a single smelting complex with a number of smelters.  You can't assign orders to individuals SMEs, but you can control how much time the complex spends on each product.


[18-Mar-25 10:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	That makes sense.


[18-Mar-25 10:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	and that's actually better for you, because it takes slightly more time to consume FE than to produce them


[18-Mar-25 10:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	(12h to produce 3, 8h24min to consume 2)


[18-Mar-25 10:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	I think I've been playing for about a month and I'm generating enough income to stay in the black AND save a bit. I'm trying to decide what/where to expand and looking for any newbie advice. I've play EvE enough to know I probably shouldn't add a second base until I'm more financially sound. Just unsure what to do why I'm expanding here on Vallis.


[18-Mar-25 10:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	*while not why


[18-Mar-25 10:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I started on Vallis like you.  My initial strategy was to upcycle as much as I could, and I found that FEO > FE > STL > PT was a good way to do that.  You don't get a CoGC bonus for the BMP that produces the PT, but it uses what you can produce locally so you don't have to ship ores and metals around.


[18-Mar-25 10:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	You're at the mercy of the market price for PT, but there's not much you can do to diversify in the beginning.


[18-Mar-25 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	Ok, so my current plan to do much the same is dumb.


[18-Mar-25 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	ISN'T dumb


[18-Mar-25 10:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I don't think so, but others might disagree.


[18-Mar-25 10:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	Is being a contract courier a viable option in this game? So far, my gut says no but doesn't hurt to ask.


[18-Mar-25 10:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I think having a BMP on your starter planet is hugely versatile - it can make so many different products


[18-Mar-25 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Running contracts isa  good way to fill up empty room on ships for extra cash, so always check the LM before you leave anywhere, but I don't think its viable as a sole strategy.


[18-Mar-25 10:15 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Katt_Tarki**:	Makes sense

[18-Mar-25 12:30 PM] ApexChat#8127

[18-Mar-25 12:40 PM] ApexChat#8127

[19-Mar-25 01:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Crash5291**:	@MapReduce unless they have patched it out, you can refuel your ship in orbit as long as the needed fuel is in that ship. No ship to ship transfers yet sadly.


[19-Mar-25 01:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Partihrl**:	Can free users accept player contracts, or does that need PRO?


[26-Mar-25 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	You need to buy PRO at least once; when it runs out, you switch to BASIC instead of FREE, which allows you to accept player contracts


[26-Mar-25 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Partihrl**:	Cool, good to know


[26-Mar-25 10:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	(gifted PRO doesn't count, it will drop you back to FREE when it runs out)


[26-Mar-25 12:57 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	Is it correct that my extraction efficiency should be 93% using PWO luxury and 100% production line condition?


[26-Mar-25 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	my HQ is on planet and have 2 extraction experts


[26-Mar-25 12:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	PRUNplanner says i should be just over 101% efficiency and that i should be extracting 15 FEO per order but only getting 14


[26-Mar-25 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	well the 14 is set to the planet, not efficiency....efficiency just affects production time


[26-Mar-25 01:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	are you using cof also?


[26-Mar-25 01:01 PM] ApexChat#8127

[26-Mar-25 01:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the percentages are multipliers (not added)

**Zugore**:	x% * y% * z%, etc


[26-Mar-25 01:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	assuming you have all PIO to fill the jobs, and all basic cons (rat,dw,ove) that puts PIO at 79%, add PWO +9%, add COF +12%

[26-Mar-25 01:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	Should be 88% according to your numbers, condition is 100% and experts is 107%.  I guess PRUNplanner is just off.  No bonus for HQ on planet due to metallurgy type?


[26-Mar-25 01:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	my pwo and cof numbers might be a little off, been a while since I've had this conversation


[26-Mar-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you should be getting a 4% metallurgy bonus based on your faction allegiance and your hq being on a NEO planet, plus @3%/unused permit


[26-Mar-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sorry, duh, not on the extractor though


[26-Mar-25 01:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	your hq bonus is based on the location of your hq (in which faction space its located)....the cogc (metalurgy) is a separate bonus


[26-Mar-25 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you get 4% metallurgy and 6% construction as a base bonus, and those increase based on your ratio of used:unused permits

**Aethean**:	prunplanner EXT numbers don't match Vallis per cycle exactly for some reason, but the overall time per unit matches.


[26-Mar-25 07:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aethean**:	like for mine, I get 14u in 11h 14m. but prunplanner says 15u in 12h 1m


[26-Mar-25 07:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Aethean**:	Both work out to about 48 minutes/unit though so the math works out over time.


[26-Mar-25 08:16 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Anatidan**:	my prunplanner says 15 units per 11h 41m, but my actual is 14unites per 12 hours, so it's off by more

**Malinko**:	PRUNplanner tells me 15 every 12h36m. I actually get 14 every 12h57m. So my rate of production is about 10% less than prunplanner. I have been having FEO shortages and it took me awhile to figure out whats going on


[27-Mar-25 08:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aethean**:	If you hit "Details" on your EXT production line, what does it say for Current Efficiency and what does Total Efficiency show in PRUNplanner?

***rackzidian** joined.*


[27-Mar-25 11:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	current efficiency is 93% and prunplanner has it as 92.7%. The big problem is prunplanner has the extraction rate at 15 when it is 14 and the time calculation is off as well

**Malinko**:	it is quite strange. I pull FEO out at 50.4 minutes per 1 FEO or 1.19 u/hr according to prunplanner and my actual is 1.08 u/hr


[28-Mar-25 08:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	if i check that my HQ is on planet in prunplanner it reduces my extraction time by even more so it would be even more innacurate


[28-Mar-25 08:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	anyone with 93% efficiency and HQ on planet able to tell me what their extraction time and rate are?


[28-Mar-25 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aethean**:	The HQ in PRUNplanner refers to a corporation HQ, not your company HQ. You are not in a corporation so should not check that box.


[28-Mar-25 08:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Aethean**:	The company HQ just defines your faction production bonuses, which are set when you select your empire faction in the planner.


[28-Mar-25 08:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Malinko**:	After checking it and unchecking it. I now have a new time shown on prunplanner bringing my u/hr down to 1.08. So my prunplanner and actual are matching now despite inaccurate times/rate.  The weird part is that the summary on pruplanner on the right didnt change.

If you don't see that, click "NEW BFR" in the bottom left to open a new buffer. Type "HELP" into the command window and that should bring up the introductory tasks.

[10-Apr-25 08:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Flinter**:	quicker money turn around for newer players, and i pay above CX and saves them on shipping if they do sell to me, but i burn so much of it that i run out constantly


[10-Apr-25 08:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**CHURCHTUARY**:	cant sell directly to a player without basic, right?

**CHURCHTUARY**:	cos i got about 70 of the stuff


[11-Apr-25 02:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Iron still isn't worth selling; there's quite a bit of overproduction since everyone tries to source it themselves since it's all so bulky; what you see on markets is leftovers. LM is a hassle :D


[11-Apr-25 02:14 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	Pardon, I'm new, but question: is steel worth selling then? It's also quite bulky but it's got quite high cost I think

[11-Apr-25 05:23 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	That's something that can change many times a day :D In general, you want to keep track of the markets for all the involved goods (including worker consumables). Right now, there doesn't seem to be a good reason to build a smelter here, except to provide e.g. iron to your other factories


[11-Apr-25 05:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	Which is a huge thing, of course, because that's a _lot_ of shipping you can avoid. If I switched to making my own iron right now, I wouldn't make much extra money (not worth the cost of setup)... but it would make things a lot easier to manage and ship around overall, and it only gets better as you expand and shipping becomes more of a bottleneck (not to mention the capital tied up in all that cargo).

**Luaan**:	Danakil makes almost three times as much water as Vallis, and it's still hilariously unprofitable; it barely covers the costs. It's not exactly worth either the cost or the shipping "savings". 2.69t a day per 45 sized rig? About 500 NIC worth? Buying water in bulk is a lot cheaper than a RIG. For Vallis, it's much worse, of course, producing just five water a day per RIG.


[16-Apr-25 01:06 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Luaan**:	But of course, it's all dwarfed by the opportunity cost of not making something actually profitable with that area and capital :D


[16-Apr-25 01:08 AM] ApexChat#8127

[16-Apr-25 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JonnyJonnyDude**:	It's cause right now, when I do the math It's about 0.525 NCC per hour for me to grow stuff, but that number doesn't connect at all to the 60


[16-Apr-25 01:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	like most folks, I just keep cash on hand to cover production taxes and don't worry about it


[16-Apr-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	on your production order it tells you how much the fee is for that order


[16-Apr-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JonnyJonnyDude**:	Yeah, that is true


[16-Apr-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it would cost 60 if the prod run took 24h


[16-Apr-25 01:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JonnyJonnyDude**:	And I prob should just keep the money handy


[16-Apr-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JonnyJonnyDude**:	But I really want to factor in taxes into my spreadsheet. To make it as precise as possible


[16-Apr-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yep, always have cash on hand, if you can't pay the fee the prod order won't start


[16-Apr-25 01:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I imagine prunplanner can help with that (not 100% sure, as I don't use it)


[16-Apr-25 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JonnyJonnyDude**:	yeah. I could use it but I wanna try doing all the math myself first


[16-Apr-25 01:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	fyi, you'll get access to a broader audience in the "Official APEX Help Channel"


[16-Apr-25 01:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**JonnyJonnyDude**:	Ok, thanks though for trying to help!

**Beherot**:	uh oh I fucked up, I click 'cancel' on queued production but didn't get resources back so I can't do anything anymore


[18-Apr-25 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You get some back


[18-Apr-25 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	hello boom boom guy


[18-Apr-25 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	nope i didnt get anything


[18-Apr-25 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	I gave you enough to cover 1-2 mistakes


[18-Apr-25 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	dont panic


[18-Apr-25 05:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	you did give me something? what? when?


[18-Apr-25 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Wrong person!


[18-Apr-25 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	lol


[18-Apr-25 05:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	lol


[18-Apr-25 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If the input was 1, yeah you loose it


[18-Apr-25 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	if it was 10 and you were at 89% you get 1 back


[18-Apr-25 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	it was in the queue so it didn't start yet


[18-Apr-25 05:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so I assumed I get 100% back


[18-Apr-25 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You`ve done another mistake somewhere if a queued item used stuff


[18-Apr-25 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Maybe something joined the queue


[18-Apr-25 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	the production queue that is


[18-Apr-25 05:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	literally all I did is add to the queue (yesterday) and now cancelled it


[18-Apr-25 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	the first order is about to finish in 2 min


[18-Apr-25 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but anything that was put after that is gone


[18-Apr-25 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	gone into production?


[18-Apr-25 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yes


[18-Apr-25 05:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	in smelter


[18-Apr-25 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	It happens


[18-Apr-25 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	What you smelting?


[18-Apr-25 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	the only thing I could FE


[18-Apr-25 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and all I have is only 3 units xd


[18-Apr-25 05:33 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah I think it's better to start again at this point


[18-Apr-25 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Instead of extracting FEO and smelting it into FE, then you`ll make more money buying in copper, silicon, or titanium ore, and smelting that into the metals, like x2 the profit


[18-Apr-25 05:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**MapReduce**:	@boom that requires more capital than a one-day player has


[18-Apr-25 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	xD


[18-Apr-25 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yeee it's really better if I start again, what was the command to restart


[18-Apr-25 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Well then, he should treat it as a tip for when he has grown some man hair


[18-Apr-25 05:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I do treat it as a tip


[18-Apr-25 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and I got a lot of hair on my body thanks


[18-Apr-25 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	you should have seen my balls


[18-Apr-25 05:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	should have seen, ah, is this before you became a woman? lol


[18-Apr-25 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I just shaved them man


[18-Apr-25 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	lol


[18-Apr-25 05:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Why do you need to restart?


[18-Apr-25 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So long as you can continue on, continue


[18-Apr-25 05:38 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	cuz I am left with only 3x FE, only thing I can produce is FEO and in a game like this 1-2 day setback ain't that much tbh


[18-Apr-25 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	So you have no carbon


[18-Apr-25 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	wait the second..


[18-Apr-25 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	weird


[18-Apr-25 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If you have FEO and Carbon carry on!


[18-Apr-25 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	no, I mean


[18-Apr-25 05:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I got my resources back


[18-Apr-25 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	lol


[18-Apr-25 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I feel dumb now


[18-Apr-25 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	yeah if you demolish new buildings you get the stuff back


[18-Apr-25 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I got them back after first order completed, the ones from the queue


[18-Apr-25 05:41 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Your 11 hours in, you got plenty of mistakes to come


[18-Apr-25 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	if you cancel an order mid-production, you get partial completion and partial return


[18-Apr-25 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	i cancalled what was in the queue


[18-Apr-25 05:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you usually lose a little though


[18-Apr-25 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and panicked cuz I didn't get them immedietaly but only after first order was completed 2min later


[18-Apr-25 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	thet queue doesn't consume anything until the order starts


[18-Apr-25 05:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yes, that's why I panicked


[18-Apr-25 05:45 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ee so it reasonable to try to sell just 3 units or is it better to wait for more


[18-Apr-25 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Wait until your supplies are running low so your ship is as full as possible


[18-Apr-25 05:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Flight costs fuel


[18-Apr-25 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	if you also put your iron back into t he smelter you can turn it into stl which is worth a lot more


[18-Apr-25 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	FE.NC1


[18-Apr-25 05:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	STL.NC1


[18-Apr-25 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	FEO.NC1


[18-Apr-25 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	C.NC1


[18-Apr-25 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	O.NC1


[18-Apr-25 05:48 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	FLX.NC1


[18-Apr-25 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	lol it is not worth it


[18-Apr-25 05:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Your route to riches is to smelt AL & SI, and then smelt them together to make CF


[18-Apr-25 05:51 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	CF.NC1


[18-Apr-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	smelting into STL gives me only around -300 NCC profit then


[18-Apr-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	notice the minus


[18-Apr-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah wait


[18-Apr-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	nvm


[18-Apr-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	forget the minus


[18-Apr-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	its 3 FE out


[18-Apr-25 05:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	3? I get only 2


[18-Apr-25 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	8xO+2xFE=2xSTL


[18-Apr-25 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Standard FE recipe is 3 out, but add flx in and its 4 out


[18-Apr-25 05:54 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Yes, STL is 2 out


[18-Apr-25 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah yes FE


[18-Apr-25 05:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	uh ah


[18-Apr-25 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	well so far the only thing I can do is to make FE, slowly


[18-Apr-25 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	8-9 hours?


[18-Apr-25 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Thats fast


[18-Apr-25 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	Just keep going with the FE


[18-Apr-25 05:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You are in a slow paced game


[18-Apr-25 05:57 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ye ik


[18-Apr-25 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	Like FE gives you plenty enough, and the oxygen for steel is not worth it


[18-Apr-25 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so it's better to just sell FE for now?


[18-Apr-25 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	FE aint worth it, move over the SI or TI as soon as possible


[18-Apr-25 05:58 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	No turn the FE into STL, you`ll make moer profit


[18-Apr-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	I've not been playing long myself (12 days) but with a bit of testing it's become obvious that, at least at the start, FE is better


[18-Apr-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	No its not


[18-Apr-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	turn it into STL


[18-Apr-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	how can I move to SI or TI if I can't produce anything else than FEO as the basic


[18-Apr-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its 2 STL out not 1 remember


[18-Apr-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	it's 1362 cost to produce 1 STL


[18-Apr-25 05:59 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You buy SIO and TIO from moria market, once that starts coming in dismantle your extractor


[18-Apr-25 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Your FEO extractor once you factor in running supplies, costs you more to run than the FEO it extracts is worth


[18-Apr-25 06:00 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I'm not at the stage where I know how to buy/sell stuff yet lol


[18-Apr-25 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Your vallis base wants to end up being noting quite literally except smelter plants and the population habs and 1 storage


[18-Apr-25 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	It's one of the tutorial videos


[18-Apr-25 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You buy in literally everything from moria


[18-Apr-25 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	And turn it all into SI or TI, or SI and AL and then into CF


[18-Apr-25 06:01 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	easy


[18-Apr-25 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	Im not patient enough for videos, I can read plenty of text but with videos I just end up skipping a lot, dont judge me lol


[18-Apr-25 06:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Also moving off FE/STL asap is advisable as they weight a lot


[18-Apr-25 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	If you want to use FE/STL, mix in some manufacture: gives more and is lighter


[18-Apr-25 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Do not do that


[18-Apr-25 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Vallis is a smetling planet


[18-Apr-25 06:03 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	You have a smelting bonus not a manufacturing one


[18-Apr-25 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Only smelt on the planet


[18-Apr-25 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	@Beherot basically you have to fly with your ship to Moria Station and press Trade, there you set the price and amount


[18-Apr-25 06:04 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so I trade with players only? nothing that is automated or npc or anything, yes?


[18-Apr-25 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Complete your current smelting FEO > FE > STL. Sell. Buy SIO and smelt into SI along with the other supplies you need. Smelting Silicon makes more money


[18-Apr-25 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	At the same time dismantle that extractor


[18-Apr-25 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	And begin building only smelters, population habs, and a storage


[18-Apr-25 06:05 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	the markets are all player, but as a free licensee you're limited to using the CX, not direct deals with specific players


[18-Apr-25 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	If later you want to make things out of metal, you grab a manufacturing or electronics planet


[18-Apr-25 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so ig now I need to wait 2 days for smelter to finish what I have and then move to SIO - got it


[18-Apr-25 06:07 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	xD


[18-Apr-25 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	in the meantime - I heard there's an app, I can play it on the phone?


[18-Apr-25 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	play is pushing it lol


[18-Apr-25 06:08 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Who knows how to work that app


[18-Apr-25 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	okay then - pretend to be a big intergalactic trader that sells iron


[18-Apr-25 06:09 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Now to make you sick smelting FE


[18-Apr-25 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	Its early day 5 of the week, I haven`t done my selling yet today, and I`m already at 6 million xD


[18-Apr-25 06:10 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	and I only have 4 planets


[18-Apr-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and I only have 1 base, 3 units of FE and a shit tone of FEO that you guys is basically waste of time


[18-Apr-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	My FEO chain: I produce FEO @ OZ-189a, FLX @ OZ-189c, buy O and C, smelt at Vallis, send STL to XG-430b for manufacturing


[18-Apr-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	say*


[18-Apr-25 06:11 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	A sand grain on a beach


[18-Apr-25 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	@Beherot just, like, take your time, read the production chains and shit and chill, it's no rush, like


[18-Apr-25 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	By 3 months in you`ll know if you are staying, and if you are that the point you`ll want to look at pro


[18-Apr-25 06:12 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	Smelt iron, sell iron, use the money to make more shit to sell iron


[18-Apr-25 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	You don't have to be the most profitable company to have fun


[18-Apr-25 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I just got some MCG BSE for free from what I assume is tutorial contract


[18-Apr-25 06:13 AM] ApexChat#8127
**boom_badda_boom**:	game startup stuff yes


[18-Apr-25 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and the next one is to pick up 500 STL fuel (which I have 450) and 250 of FTL fuel (I have 100)


[18-Apr-25 06:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	am I supposed to buy it now?


[18-Apr-25 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127

**Gregor_Samsa**:	It's a gift from the game ^^


[18-Apr-25 06:17 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	can't press it


[18-Apr-25 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	Then you need to complete some sort of condition


[18-Apr-25 06:18 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	Did you found your base?


[18-Apr-25 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	to start a flight but there's no reason to do so now as I have not enough to sell


[18-Apr-25 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	Then just wait


[18-Apr-25 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	You'll get it when you start a flight anyway and get the gift


[18-Apr-25 06:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	just like in real life huh


[18-Apr-25 06:21 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	You say you no good with videos but okay with reading, then you can read the handbook: https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/

APEX handbook Welcome, licensees! The APEX Handbook is divided in two big sections:

[18-Apr-25 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	The tutorials section got everything that's in the videos


[18-Apr-25 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	nice


[18-Apr-25 06:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I like reading, cant focus with the video, guy is talking too slow


[18-Apr-25 06:27 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	overall thanks for the help, it seems I can check in I think when Monday comes so smelter will be done


[18-Apr-25 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	lots to read and explore in the meantime


[18-Apr-25 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	or actually I could dismantle extractor now and just build a second smelter to make things go faster, then sell all the FE and move onto silicon


[18-Apr-25 06:30 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	things are pretty slow in the beginning


[18-Apr-25 06:31 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I don't mind slow, I just don't wanna cockblock myself from further playing if u get me


[18-Apr-25 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	DW, I'm doing just iron and it's going good for me, proper profit and shit


[18-Apr-25 06:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	You can always change to silicon if need be


[18-Apr-25 06:34 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ye in theory I could change to silicon the moment SME finish smelting stuff with O n C i got for free


[18-Apr-25 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	demolishing extractor and making a second smelter but dont know how much I get from demolishing it


[18-Apr-25 06:35 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	uh uh


[18-Apr-25 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	You'll get most of the resources from demolishing if you not been using the extractor a whil


[18-Apr-25 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	But extractor don't got enough resources for a smelter


[18-Apr-25 06:36 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Gregor_Samsa**:	But you got enough shekels to buy all that you need for a second smelter


[18-Apr-25 06:37 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I'll just wait then


[18-Apr-25 07:43 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Ravick**:	Also, if you like the game and decide to go pro then there is a pretty active lending market so you might be able to get a loan to help speed up your expansion.

**Beherot**:	@Stonk Ye, exactly what I was planning to do, focus on FE stuff first and later think to do later but probably I'll try to make a second base for extracting only and at the same go full SME on the current one


[21-Apr-25 09:02 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I just sent one my first ship, I have no idea what I'm doing but I don't have to think about it for the next 5h


[21-Apr-25 09:16 AM] ApexChat#8127
**rutkre**:	why not have your base handle both task at the same time? That saves your ship fuel cost


[21-Apr-25 09:19 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	some other guy told me its more efficent cuz of planet bonus or whatever, dunno man I'll probably end up doing much later anyway


[21-Apr-25 09:20 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but having a second base would be neat since I'd prefer to be more self sufficent, I mean if I have to send my ship which costs fuel to buy stuff anyway, I can aswell send it to my second base to collect stuff for 'free' right


[21-Apr-25 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	besidies, I have to yet figure out selling/buying stuff which I'll do at around 9pm


[21-Apr-25 09:22 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	THEN I will think what to do next


[21-Apr-25 09:26 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	Don't bother about your base to much in the beginning of the game.


[21-Apr-25 09:28 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	An extraction base and seperate smelting base is good for efficiency, but you should also check if that is possible for the production you want to do


[21-Apr-25 09:29 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	For example. There is no good planet with resource extraction COGC and FEO as resource on the planet


[21-Apr-25 09:32 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	But it does is the case for ALO. So you could do ALO extraction on QQ-645b and smelt it on Vallis.


[21-Apr-25 09:42 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	I get my FEO at OZ-189a, which has decent feo concentration and Res Ext cogc (but I primarily draw LST and HAL there)


[21-Apr-25 09:46 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	guys, I don't even know how to sell stuff yet, slow down


[21-Apr-25 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I appreciate the advices but honestly, what's the reason to trash my mind with stuff I'm really far away from


[21-Apr-25 09:47 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	especially in such slow paced game


[21-Apr-25 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	You can only take it in for later


[21-Apr-25 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	most of stuff I won't remember anyway, not even talking about my bad af memory but overall if it takes one thing a few hours to days I'll probably end up forggeting about 3-5 times and chang my mind twice


[21-Apr-25 09:49 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	You don't have to do it


[21-Apr-25 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	@Zugore I was only checking planets with 3x green as he is a beginning player.


[21-Apr-25 09:50 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	But that planet also works :)


[21-Apr-25 09:52 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	sry, just caught the tail end and chimed in....a bit of advice, I keep a notebook and pen handy.


[21-Apr-25 09:53 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ye I know I could but I'd rather use the knowledge at the time I gain it, that's the most efficient way of remembering and learning stuff for me


[21-Apr-25 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	this is just a game and planning too much into the future seems pointless to me, I wanna enjoy it while I actively do the stuff and I hate plan-making since it more often than not change anyway


[21-Apr-25 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Stonk**:	All good, when you have questions just ask :)


[21-Apr-25 09:55 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I will do for sure !


[21-Apr-25 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	as I am still the stupid one in terms of this game


[21-Apr-25 09:56 AM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	lol


[21-Apr-25 11:40 AM] ApexChat#8127
**NepoleoNMan55**:	Greetings I am currently at Moria station with 1x ship with 212.98t available with a flight plan to Vallis. If there is anyone who is looking to transport goods I will be leaving in around 50 minutes.


[21-Apr-25 12:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It looks like you may not have bough a Pro license.  Without one, you cannot make player-to-player contracts, including shipping.


[21-Apr-25 12:07 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NepoleoNMan55**:	oh well thats a shame. :(


[21-Apr-25 12:18 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Pomme_de_Terroriste**:	If you do end up buying one, you'll be able to accept (just not send) contracts if it lapses though.

[21-Apr-25 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	alo? is someone active enough to let me ask one quick question?


[21-Apr-25 05:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	is buying luxury consumables worth it at the beginning? I assume it help with workforce's efficiency, yes?


[21-Apr-25 05:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	taking into consideration how it is slowly consumed and that it's not that expensive (i think)


[21-Apr-25 06:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	it's worth it, though tbh I've never not used them.


[21-Apr-25 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	well I just bought 10 of each for now


[21-Apr-25 06:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so glad u say so


[21-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	efficiency for PIO without pwo + cof = 79% (just rat. ove, and dw)....adding the two luxuries brings you up to 100%


[21-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and ye, Ik it aint much but it's enough until I earn some cash again


[21-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Zugore**:	you're close to the store, no worries


[21-Apr-25 06:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but Ik that, I didnt know if these 21% are worth it


[21-Apr-25 06:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I can do basic math xd


[21-Apr-25 06:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but I'll just follow you and just supply my slaves with luxuries too


[21-Apr-25 06:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	wait, do I actually pay them? or just give them supplies so they dont starve?


[21-Apr-25 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	no payment to your workers, just consumables.  You do have to pay production fees every time productions starts, but they scale with the size of the production order.  You can't save by using larger orders.


[21-Apr-25 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so they're my slaves


[21-Apr-25 06:21 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	good


[21-Apr-25 06:22 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and ye I already figured out production fee but thanks


[21-Apr-25 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	I don't think so, since they can migrate freely.  If the government doesn't have enough facilities in place to make them happy, they will leave.


[21-Apr-25 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	escape you mean


[21-Apr-25 06:23 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	so far ive encountered very few cases where the luxury consumables werent worth it


[21-Apr-25 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	good to hear


[21-Apr-25 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	unless COF and KOM prices are doing crazy things again


[21-Apr-25 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Agree with that completely.  Luxuries not being worth it would be an edge case.


[21-Apr-25 06:24 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	my slaves are gonna be force feed with luxuries


[21-Apr-25 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	ah. havent checked the prices in a while since i almost always do 30day orders or muntilples of that


[21-Apr-25 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	imagine in real life being force feed by your boss, like "DRINK THAT COFFE YOU MORON !"


[21-Apr-25 06:25 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	but looks like the prices are doing a crazy again


[21-Apr-25 06:26 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	940 for coffe is crazy?


[21-Apr-25 06:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	check the 180d price chart


[21-Apr-25 06:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	but its still worth it. otherwise ppl wouldnt buy


[21-Apr-25 06:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	in 180d seems steady, only in 90d looks ugly


[21-Apr-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but honestly it doesnt affect me much atm, im like third day in the game


[21-Apr-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	the only thing steady is the price increase. damn tariffs even affecting us here


[21-Apr-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	10 COF is enough for around a week for me


[21-Apr-25 06:30 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	ha


[21-Apr-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i dont even wanna figure out how much of the black gold my peeps slurp down in a week


[21-Apr-25 06:31 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	my spreadsheet says 83.3 a day across all planets.


[21-Apr-25 06:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	actually, it says "caffeinated infusion" so from now I'll asume they drink redbulls since it's my personal fav and I don't drink coffee


[21-Apr-25 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	for me its about 10 a day atm


[21-Apr-25 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-25 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	0.6

**Retread**:	we all start there


[21-Apr-25 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127

[21-Apr-25 06:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yes


[21-Apr-25 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	im waiting for my stuff to come so I can build my sec SME


[21-Apr-25 06:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	since poe2 has me in its claws i dont really check that reguraly anymore tbh. also idk why i would even wanna expand anymore other than number go up


[21-Apr-25 06:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	well my goal is to become self sufficient (maybe not in 100%) so I aim at buying more bases in the future, expand


[21-Apr-25 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and idc if it is the most efficient way, most profitable or not, that's just my goal for this game


[21-Apr-25 06:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	very based ngl


[21-Apr-25 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	why


[21-Apr-25 06:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	retread I can see you typing, tell me: Is it wrong that I constantly read ur name as "redhead"?


[21-Apr-25 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	It's an interesting thing to think about - what's the minimum number and types of bases you'd have to have to not have to buy anything  at the CX


[21-Apr-25 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	(I will keep doing that and u cannot stop me)


[21-Apr-25 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	lol


[21-Apr-25 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	bc i like it when ppl dont feel forced to be 110%efficient just for the sake of efficiency


[21-Apr-25 06:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	by all means.  All kinds of internet muffinheads have chosen to mis-read it in a much more offensive way.


[21-Apr-25 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	well Im trying to be realistic so that's why I noted not in 100%, some stuff I'll still buy but given time I hope to elimnate such need to the minimum


[21-Apr-25 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	what offensive way? share, please


[21-Apr-25 06:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	id imagine it depends very much on what industry ur going for


[21-Apr-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	no idea man, not yet


[21-Apr-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	for now metallurgy it is


[21-Apr-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	There is definite pluses to your approach.  The market is small enough to be very susceptible to manipulation, and producing your own consumables definitely insulates you from that.


[21-Apr-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	like the number gotta be pretty low if u wanna be self-sufficient in food industries


[21-Apr-25 06:40 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ye exactly, one of the reasons I want to do that


[21-Apr-25 06:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	food is probably one of the these things I will pretty late invest in tbh, if at all


[21-Apr-25 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i bet u can get a 2 base completly self-sufficient company if u dont care about luxury consumables


[21-Apr-25 06:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	for all I care my slaves can eat shit, worst case scenario I will buy them only basic stuff


[21-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	ok nvm


[21-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i take that back


[21-Apr-25 06:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

**NgURoyalZ**:	i never looked at the OVE prod chain XD


[21-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i thought it was just PE


[21-Apr-25 06:44 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yee too complicated for me too


[21-Apr-25 06:45 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	the PG ads one hell of a rats tail to that plan


[21-Apr-25 06:46 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	PG is excellent steady money, though


[21-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i can imagine. shits in everything. even our balls


[21-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	it is? maybe I should have choose farmer start


[21-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I mean


[21-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	literally do the basics for slaves


[21-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	starting from farms


[21-Apr-25 06:47 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	PG is chemistry though


[21-Apr-25 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	yeah ik I meant it as focusing on producing stuff required for slaves


[21-Apr-25 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	starting with food


[21-Apr-25 06:48 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	gotcha


[21-Apr-25 06:49 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	sometimes I think faster than I think


[21-Apr-25 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	*insert adequate meme*


[21-Apr-25 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	30min lets goooo and then I can go to sleep


[21-Apr-25 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	EPO is also pretty good. thats one im considering. i already make the CL


[21-Apr-25 06:50 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	after my SME starts doing shit


[21-Apr-25 06:51 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	EPO is very good too.


[21-Apr-25 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	Except it's hard to find enough CL for it


[21-Apr-25 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	but id spread myself out a little too much with it i think


[21-Apr-25 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	the heck is EPO


[21-Apr-25 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	MAT EPO is your friend


[21-Apr-25 06:52 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	with only 2 ships and having to do constant trips between here and Verdant


[21-Apr-25 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	every time you ask that question, use MAT to tell you about materials and BUI to tell you about buildings.


[21-Apr-25 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	thanks a lot


[21-Apr-25 06:53 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	was actually searching for such command rn


[21-Apr-25 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i already have montem for my CL prod so i cant really do a whole other 500are base for EPO


[21-Apr-25 06:54 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	so the next closest would be circe or circa. those names i always confuse


[21-Apr-25 06:56 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I wonder how much could I achieve in theory with only one planet/base? For example with Vallis alone?


[21-Apr-25 06:58 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	it would certainly be possible to just expand my montem to 1000 area but ive heard that its often not worth going past the initial 500 simply bc u need 3 permits for a total of 1000 area when ud get 1500 with 3 seperate bases


[21-Apr-25 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	would make logistic pretty simple tho


[21-Apr-25 06:59 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I assume it all ends up with the question: What are you producing?


[21-Apr-25 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	it would be EPO


[21-Apr-25 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	if it can be doable on just one planet then maybe it is worth it for simplicity


[21-Apr-25 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	with the CL im already making. i also have the C and the O on Verdant


[21-Apr-25 07:00 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	the only thing id need is H


[21-Apr-25 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	from what I noticed H is quite common?


[21-Apr-25 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	true


[21-Apr-25 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so no problem with that


[21-Apr-25 07:01 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	for you I mean


[21-Apr-25 07:02 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	we even have some here but i dont have any area left on vallis XD and no desire to produce my own for such a little ammount


[21-Apr-25 07:03 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	then start producing something else extra that needs H


[21-Apr-25 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	Id need 40/day and one Collector on vallis makes 3.6


[21-Apr-25 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	a day


[21-Apr-25 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	that sucks


[21-Apr-25 07:04 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	better of just buying it


[21-Apr-25 07:05 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	15min left uh uh


[21-Apr-25 07:06 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I wonder if its worth it for me to produce my own O for SME stuff, it is quite cheap to buy but I wouldn't have to bother about it


[21-Apr-25 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	a lot of Chemety need H so there is always a good supply. also its a raw resource so my extra 40/d consumption wont make a big impact in the market


[21-Apr-25 07:08 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	what is chemety


[21-Apr-25 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	its chemistry with a few typos


[21-Apr-25 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	Ik im just being an ass


[21-Apr-25 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	bc i shouldve gone to sleep 2h ago xD


[21-Apr-25 07:09 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	sleep is for the weak bro


[21-Apr-25 07:10 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	yea not when u work in retail

**Beherot**:	until 29 I need to figure out how mobile ver of this game works cuz ill be gone for 10 days


[21-Apr-25 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	i mean ive gone to work with no sleep a few times but always when i had a free day after bc i was DEAD


[21-Apr-25 07:11 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I feel you


[21-Apr-25 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I remember I was so tired that one time I started to see things when I was coming back to home at 2 am


[21-Apr-25 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	dark forrest and stuff


[21-Apr-25 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	also concerning mobile. ive tried. and i mean really tried. ive given up


[21-Apr-25 07:12 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Beherot**:	ye was thinking about the idea of making another acc and had the same conclusion xd


[21-Apr-25 07:27 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	btw what happens when I have not enough slaves for certain building? like 40/50 only?


[21-Apr-25 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	less efficiency


[21-Apr-25 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	by how much %? the same that workforce is lacking?


[21-Apr-25 07:28 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	assuming ur workers have both lux so they are 100%


[21-Apr-25 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	if u have only half the workers u have 50%


[21-Apr-25 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah I should have buy enough for 2 SME not just one then


[21-Apr-25 07:29 PM] ApexChat#8127

**NgURoyalZ**:	idk actually


[21-Apr-25 07:31 PM] ApexChat#8127

**Beherot**:	cruel


[21-Apr-25 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	eh not really


[21-Apr-25 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so how is flux related to paid acc?


[21-Apr-25 07:32 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	bc if u were paid i couldve sent u a contract for some flux


[21-Apr-25 07:33 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	it seems I should have gone with Montem instead of Vallis


[21-Apr-25 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	H for LST so I could produce FLX


[21-Apr-25 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	I think I know where my sec base will be


[21-Apr-25 07:34 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	for making metals vallis is better


[21-Apr-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	then what for is montem


[21-Apr-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	bc of the 25% bonus we get on metallurgy through goverment programs


[21-Apr-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	montem is chemestry


[21-Apr-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	ah


[21-Apr-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	so u are making durgs huh


[21-Apr-25 07:35 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	drugs


[21-Apr-25 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	technically im making poison


[21-Apr-25 07:36 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	what's the difference


[21-Apr-25 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	technically im making poison too whenever Im visiting my toilet


[21-Apr-25 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	drugs make u feel good before killing u


[21-Apr-25 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	if u die of clorine gas its gonna be pretty unfun


[21-Apr-25 07:37 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	dunno tried edible only once and felt tired af


[21-Apr-25 07:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	i meant another posion but chlorine is fun too


[21-Apr-25 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	but overall FLX seem useful so Ill probably make my sec base there


[21-Apr-25 07:39 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	its pretty funny imo that we season our food with a compound of one of the most volitile metals and an element that can be immensly toxic


[21-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	bruh basically most of plant based stuff we use for seasoning literally developed to be too toxic to be eaten


[21-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	yea XD


[21-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	like look at chilly, it developed to be too spicy to eat


[21-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	and we be like "GIMME"


[21-Apr-25 07:41 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	and what humans did? genetically enhanced to be even more spicy and eat it xd


[21-Apr-25 07:42 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	basically everything what we eat was at some point modified by humans tbh


[21-Apr-25 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**NgURoyalZ**:	it was nice talking man but i really gotta go now XD too little sleep is worse for me than no sleep and im already tired


[21-Apr-25 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Beherot**:	go for no sleep then


[21-Apr-25 07:43 PM] ApexChat#8127

[30-Apr-25 10:38 PM] ApexChat#8127
**Retread**:	If you have a warehouse, into the warehouse.  If you have a ship docked, the ship.  If you have neither, they go into a contract - check CONTS.
