I dunno where to put my plans, so as this is named planning i'll explain here. I'm curently governor of a Small Planet called LS-746b, it's a planet exactly half way beetween ANT and BEN so it's practical . It's actually normal grav, temp and such, so cheap to establish. It has no real ressources, but it's compensated by the fact it cost normal mats to establish a base here. Currently it has a Chamber of commerce dedicatel to fuel refinning. But this can be changed , becaus enot so many people there so far. It also has allready a Local market builded, and a very small infracstructure of one safety station and One Infirmary.  So if u are interested and you have no company, you could get some share of my company there who get the Taxes, and then futher one develop the HQ there.

I think the best of this planet it's his location Halfway BEN_ANT  in the Antares space of course .

whatever you call it, it's still Antares :), so it goes well with the Antares development Initiatives Plans üôÇ and this part of the space is very undevelopped ( i mean the southern LS planets )

Ok. I'm planning out the extent of my first base, aiming for HER production. As this will be my first full base, I would appreciate a look-over before I go spend all my grant money

RIGs on harmonia aren't too bad compared to something like RIGs on proxion


[24-Jan-24 09:48 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
just about anything is better than RIGs on Prox. It's all about opportunity cost though. Are the RIGs saving you more money than the same amount of area would make you as FRMs.

[24-Jan-24 09:51 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
so you save 1727 on H2O but you could have made 12545 on the same land. So the opportunity cost of the 3 RIGs is over 10k CIS


[24-Jan-24 09:58 PM] jvaler#0000
my situation was a bit niche. having the 2 extra FRMs vs 5 RIGs didn't hit any clean breakpoints for being able to burn into C. but the 5 RIGs let me not have to worry about importing water


[28-Jan-24 09:11 AM] limp_wristed#0000
bweh, antares seems to be running low on RCO... might have to figure out how to retool my hephaestus base to something else


[28-Jan-24 09:13 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
do you need it for you or are you just trying to capitalize on the shortage? cause I could grow some RCO if it's needed


[28-Jan-24 09:18 AM] limp_wristed#0000
i need it for inputs my hephaestus base makes ove / pwo / exo. im not really in trouble yet though, i just mean like. mid-term


[28-Jan-24 09:23 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I just dropped a core module on Harmonia but haven't build anything yet. I'll probably have 10 FRMs there soon though and could definitely make you some RCO


[28-Jan-24 09:23 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
maybe even process it if you'd rather use COT


[28-Jan-24 09:29 AM] limp_wristed#0000
i think i'll just switch my own production on harmonia to RCO at some point. it's kind of the least profitable thing to produce still is the problem


[28-Jan-24 09:31 AM] limp_wristed#0000
maybe i can just shift some of my production to some of the other things you can produce at a bmp to reduce my dependence on cotton


[28-Jan-24 09:53 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
PE and MCG are the $$$


[28-Jan-24 09:54 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I don't even make my own PWO/OVE/EXO/etc. PE makes so much money for me that it's more profitable to make PE then just buy all that (though I do make REP)


[28-Jan-24 09:56 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
That's honestly what I'd recommend. A mix of PE and MCG depending on which is more profitable. Figure out the breaking point for consumables where it's better to make them yourself, and if the price ever goes over that then make them, otherwise buy them with the PE/MCG money ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[28-Jan-24 10:07 AM] havanista#0000
i make tons of money smleting ores, then transforming those metals in alloys, thne or making hulls, selling alloys or reserving that to make cargo later on


[28-Jan-24 10:08 AM] havanista#0000
and to make more money, i make my own carbon for the ore smelting


[28-Jan-24 10:08 AM] havanista#0000
if not the Carbon itself is twice more expensives to get that the ores


[28-Jan-24 10:31 AM] limp_wristed#0000
i added some mcg and lst for now. i might end up not making mcg though bc for imports it's kind of a pain, takes it from a 4 day touch to a 2 day touch pretty much single handedly

[07-Feb-24 09:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I figured I should share the development plans that we have been working on in SE-110, in coordination with the two [FCST]  folks. We recently settled several planets and added COGCs, ADMs, WARs, and local markets. We added:
SE-110a (food processing)
SE-110b (agriculture via HYFs)
SE-110d (resource extraction for INCs)
And of course, SE-110c is Ice Station Alpha, which has been doing great.

SE-110b has been around the longest, and it's got a nice population bonus, we can probably add a HYF base every other week, maybe more with some notice. Sidepipe is governing for OOG
SE-110a has ~800 open pioneer jobs out of 2100, but it's growing fast. It doesn't have a governor but Tuffy from OOG is going to fill in when his other governor role is up.
SE-110d is governed by Komalarn from [FCST]. Got 1280 open jobs and 3292 pioneers. Also growing very fast so those jobs will be filled soon. 
Harpercz continues to run ISA and it's been doing great on population. 

I have bases on all 4 planets and it's been great for DW and C production. My HYF base feeds plenty of HCP to the corp so I'm really happy with the project so far

Nice!! this is awesome. I've been trying to build up some high-tier consumables infrastructure in KAWA before I build some big shipbuilding bases in Ant1. This actually seems like a great place to do some of that. I've got a ORC on Harmonia already... hmm...


[08-Feb-24 08:17 AM] nyanism#0000
Need some expert advice on my expansion toward Harmonia / Phobos

https://prunplanner.org/shared/be047f22-1a95-42d2-b3d4-9c6fcd2bb95b

Currently Harmonia has priority cus of the more appropriated COGC


[08-Feb-24 08:22 AM] nyanism#0000
the aim was to set up the cheapest base with quick return, that doenst require much shipping and other support as im  relatively new, and the budget are somewhat limited


[08-Feb-24 08:44 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Harmonia base looks good. Honestly I really wouldn't farm on Phobos, especially if you build on Harmonia. I'd just build 12 FRMs on Harmonia and go from there. *maybe* the FP on Phobos, but those would be better on Norwick. Building whole bases in one industry is the way to go, *especially* if you synergize with the CoGC bonus, but even if you don't the expert bonus still makes it idea to stick to one industry per base, so all FRM on Harmonia, all FP on Phobos would be better than splitting both bases, and the shipping for that wouldn't be too difficult at all

[08-Feb-24 08:48 AM] nyanism#0000
understandable, and thanks for the clarification, i just think providing 2 plans are better in term of comparison, and yes it does explain things a bit more thoroughly with clear idea of what i should do


[08-Feb-24 08:53 AM] nyanism#0000
i'll adjust the starting loadout to be pure FRM between 8-12 plots depend on how much i have for em, and the stock for DDTs, dont want to make too many trips too (unless ofc, heres shipping work to be done lol)


[08-Feb-24 09:21 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
FRM bases usually aren't too bad for shipping. I have one that I visit once a week, could visit it even less if I was growing something else

[08-Feb-24 12:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
oh! yeah, that's on the workforce screen. The first number is how many you have, the second is what you have the capacity for. So you have capacity for another FRM wihtout building another HB1 if you wanted

Hello there, guys, I need help, I'm thinking about Metalurgy, we have main base for that on Deimos, but we need expand, and im not sure, if the Vulcan is good choice, bcs there is another interesting option = 
What do u thing about - ZV-194c?
First 3 planets are rly close each other (even closer than SE-110) and first two are nicely develop for construction.
I'm thinking about C like a nice base for supplies on A + B. What whould u do?? (Sorry for Grammer ü§£üòá)


[09-Feb-24 03:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Vulcan would be good for FEO EXT and you could pair with INC for C production for your smelters on Deimos


[09-Feb-24 03:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Or there is Nascent where you would swap FEO for ALO


[09-Feb-24 04:02 PM] spekktra_#0000
We have C farm on SE-110d


[09-Feb-24 04:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok then Vulcan would be FEO and Nascent would be ALO


[09-Feb-24 04:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You could also look into TIO


[09-Feb-24 04:05 PM] spekktra_#0000
Wow, a lot of ppls on Nascent,  but it's to far away... üòÑ


[09-Feb-24 04:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs not that bad tbh I do it, but there are a lot of people who sell AL


[09-Feb-24 04:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
With FE you could process it more and get STL which could maybe be profitable


[09-Feb-24 04:10 PM] spekktra_#0000
STL.... ouch Steal... I was like, why he is talking about fuel ü§£ü§£

Yeah‚Ä¶ English is a bit much at times


[09-Feb-24 04:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Also I wouldn‚Äôt go for ZV-194c until a bit later. Vulcan is a lot better for FEO


[09-Feb-24 04:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Vulcan is a good option for metallurgy.


[09-Feb-24 04:59 PM] spekktra_#0000
The thins is: I will be need supply 194a and b with AL and FE, and it's not perfect way to do it from Vulcan, my opinion is, is much easier supply it from 194c and bring ALO from Deimos, bcs ALO is rly light. But this planning need develop the 194c for that.....


[09-Feb-24 05:00 PM] spekktra_#0000
Or, I can build only PP2 and then I will be need only AL.... to.many possibilites... üò¶


[09-Feb-24 05:06 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well Vulcan and Deimos CoGC have metallurgy programs going‚Ä¶ so you wouldn‚Äôt get a boost for your EXT on those planets.


[09-Feb-24 05:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
nascent has a resource extraction program in the CoGC


[09-Feb-24 05:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
that would buff the EXT on the planet


[09-Feb-24 05:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The Metalurgy one would buff SME or other Metalurgy buildings

[10-Feb-24 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
Deimos is ZV-759c, so you can do `PLI ZV-759c` in a new buffer to see it


[10-Feb-24 11:11 AM] archielvahr#0000
the most important thing is the COGC (C hamber of Global Commerce) of the planet. Deimos has a metallurgy project, so it gives you a 25% bonus

[10-Feb-24 11:14 AM] archielvahr#0000
basically it's a mechanic to let new players start anywhere, even if it's full. But you can't make your second, third, etc base on a full planet.

and sending off your starting resources before coliq-ing is against the rules too so...

One of the weird worlds - its fertile... but _not_ 3x green.


[10-Feb-24 12:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that is pretty weird


[10-Feb-24 12:39 PM] archielvahr#0000
I guess the fertility is pretty poor... fertile is fertile, but maybe you might as well just do HYFs somewhere instead


[10-Feb-24 12:40 PM] shagie#0000
Its part of the IC push to the southwest.


[10-Feb-24 12:43 PM] shagie#0000
Normally, when people pull up the FIO planet search and look for fertility, no other planet modifiers are selected - just tripple green because what else would you consider?  But Chu is out there.

Lemuria is another in the SW outward growth.  There is an interesting shipping route with Lemuria at one end.

Bummer. So just always buy Oxygen?


[10-Feb-24 02:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
The most ideal way is always buy everything to turn into AL.


[10-Feb-24 02:12 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
the only reason to *not* run all SME is if you can't keep up with shipping, but it's definitely less profitable than just buying all the inputs so there's a cost to that convenience. As a first planet you should be fine though.


[10-Feb-24 02:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I‚Äôd agree with that statement


[10-Feb-24 02:13 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I have 3 Col and 17 SME rn

There are also people here who would help you out with shipping here and there, along with us offering ship upgrades too.


[10-Feb-24 02:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
But if you have only one base you'd be fine I'd imagine for Deimos.


[10-Feb-24 02:14 PM] degeneratesupreme#0000
Makes sense. So would it make sense to produce Oxygen and Carbon if I had dedicated bases on planets with CoGC bonuses to those materials? Like a Gases base and an Elements base?

It dropped my ROI by 5 days by producing my own Oxygen

Eventually imma axe it tho and full smelter press on Deimos


[10-Feb-24 02:17 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
possibly. vertically integrating your empire, but sticking to one industry type per planet, is what most people do. Maximum efficiency from experts and CoGC on each planet.


[10-Feb-24 02:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
or if you find that you're able to source your inputs easily enough, the more profitable thing is to move *up*. So if you're smelting AL, build some PP2s on Nike, or something else that uses the AL and turns it into a more profitable product


[10-Feb-24 05:35 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Will finally  have 3 EXT and 12 PP2 by tomorrow afternoon, finally maxed out the Nike base, now to max outthe Deimos smelters next.

Why are there no good planets for Limestone extraction?


[10-Feb-24 05:37 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Nike is good, get about 21 per extractor

I wonder if we should have some ANT specific starter guides. There's lots of tutorial content that's great, but people are perpetually unsure what stuff to make where. And ANT is at a comparative disadvantage because of the huge number of players starting on Phobos. Lots of farmers and manufacturers on Phobos


[10-Feb-24 06:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
That'd be a good idea, honestly.

i don't think they're advocating for changing phobos' COGC (though i'd love to do that)
just to raise awareness that phobos is a bad starter so that new players make better choices

So I am almost ready to build the CM and make a second base. Beforehand, I used my little program to look around the market for what's the most profitable at the moment and I am now torn between making a PP3 base on Nike building rfabs or a BMP base on Hephaestus making SEA and OFF


[19-Feb-24 12:07 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I like the Nike plan since it overall should make more and I can use the fabs myself at some point


[19-Feb-24 12:08 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I like the Hephaestus plan because it will be cheaper to build, it's right next to CX, and it wouldn't be making that much less

how is the volume on your options?

okay, but how is the sales volume on your options? are you going to be able to sell enough to make it pay off in a reasonable time frame?


[19-Feb-24 12:17 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
The RBH looks much better in that department. I would be making 2000 - 2500 SEA or 34.28 RBH

[29-Feb-24 11:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
What do y'all look for in a good material to produce, generally speaking ? How much must be traded daily vs your base's daily production ? How much demand must there be to consider a material ? How many orders should there be ?


[29-Feb-24 11:10 PM] tanda#0000
I'm locked into AL production and I guess I go down with this ship


[29-Feb-24 11:12 PM] jvaler#0000
good vibes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
as long as the base prod is < half of weekly traded it seems alright to make... maybe idk


[29-Feb-24 11:12 PM] jvaler#0000
quarter is probably better but i don't think i'm following that lol


[29-Feb-24 11:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I can't code my program to recognize good vibes, but the 1/2 or 1/4 of weekly is helpful. I thought above 1/7 weekly is hard to sell


[29-Feb-24 11:14 PM] jvaler#0000
well i mean adjusted for rate per day. you'd multiply your base's prod by 7 to compare the numbers


[29-Feb-24 11:14 PM] jvaler#0000
like i make 200 REP/d and REP.AI1 7d units is 1838 rn


[29-Feb-24 11:14 PM] jvaler#0000
so it'd be 1400 REP/wk vs 1838


[29-Feb-24 11:15 PM] jvaler#0000
wait that's worse than i thought it was


[29-Feb-24 11:15 PM] jvaler#0000
that'd explain my liquidity issues lmfao


[29-Feb-24 11:15 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

starting to pile up, been keeping a close eye on CXOB to fight people for lowest spot though


[29-Feb-24 11:16 PM] jvaler#0000
and i shipped some over to BEN to sell lmfao


[29-Feb-24 11:16 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think 1/3 would be a good start as a metric of decent deals


[29-Feb-24 11:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
What if there are usually 3 buy orders from different companies on any given day, you reckon it's good enough ? What would be your limit ?


[29-Feb-24 11:18 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Do you consider that at all ?


[29-Feb-24 11:19 PM] jvaler#0000
not sure what you mean...


[29-Feb-24 11:20 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You `CXOB` a prospective ticker and see that there are 3 companies placing buy orders


[29-Feb-24 11:25 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't pay buy orders much mind, they're kinda immaterial. anyone can put up a super lowball buy order for a bit of cash


[29-Feb-24 11:26 PM] jvaler#0000
most people buy from sell orders rather than wait for someone desperate enough to sell to a buy order


[29-Feb-24 11:27 PM] jvaler#0000
they can be a nice safety net to sell to if they're around, but i don't consider them consistent or reliable demand


[29-Feb-24 11:35 PM] jvaler#0000
@histidinedwarf i'm probably a bad person to get market advice from actually... like 2/3 of my bases are contracted out to co-ops or other people

What combo of inputs do people use for mass ration production?


[03-Mar-24 02:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So I looked into how much of the weekly trade can one base make for each material at AI1 and got this, which confused me. This should be every single material where a dedicated 100% efficiency base would make less than 50% of weekly trade, excluding dead markets, defined as having 0 buy orders. In total, 24 materials

[03-Mar-24 02:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If you define a dead market as 0 weekly trade, then it's 33 materials

[03-Mar-24 02:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I kinda expected more


[03-Mar-24 02:09 PM] jvaler#0000
honestly it doesn't surprise me. the playerbase isn't small by any means, but lots of people aren't at a point where they can make max efficiency 500 area bases(and some just don't want to in favor of sub-optimal self sufficiency) so the people that can/do make a big impact. hephaestus only has ~100 plots used


[03-Mar-24 02:10 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
That still seems insane to me... That's such a good planet and I've had my eyes on it for almost a year now. Idk why it's not more full


[03-Mar-24 02:11 PM] jvaler#0000
ikr


[03-Mar-24 02:13 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Astraeus has ~20 full plots, so 1/5th of the people on Hephaestus are probably also there, I'd guess shipbuilders. So about 80 people in Antares have a single manufacturing base there... Where are people manufacturing there? Or is everyone just getting that stuff on CX?


[03-Mar-24 02:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'll be on Hephaestus soon though... still trying to get fabs but I'll be making a bunch of ship parts there soon.


[03-Mar-24 02:14 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000

[03-Mar-24 02:15 PM] jvaler#0000
the AA AFAB project uses 3 astraeus bases to leave it's members open to using hephaestus for personal use


[03-Mar-24 02:16 PM] jvaler#0000
for KV and NL prod cause WPL is low building count for 500 area to save on HSE


[03-Mar-24 02:16 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
oh that's cool


[03-Mar-24 02:16 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
This kinda makes me think that most trade happens in-corp with marketshare like this


[03-Mar-24 02:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
In Antares specifically I think that's almost certainly true


[03-Mar-24 02:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Lots of really big corps doing corp projects that don't really bother with CX


[03-Mar-24 02:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
BEN can be the same with a lot of materials. I think MOR and HRT probably have the most active CXs


[03-Mar-24 02:27 PM] jvaler#0000
it's unfortunately not really possible to do large scale base min-maxxing using the CX due to it's unreliable supply. that's why these projects minimize touching the CX as much as possible.

but this aversion to the CX at large scale just further drives the problem of underutilization of the CX. it's an unfortunate cycle


[03-Mar-24 02:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well what my new base should be making is not on the list so I'll see how it goes


[03-Mar-24 02:41 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'll look into having the program find profitable bases making more than 1 material to stay under the 50%


[03-Mar-24 02:46 PM] jvaler#0000
that's probably best


[03-Mar-24 02:47 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd be struggling way more if i was making 100% REP in my 20 BMP lolol


[03-Mar-24 02:56 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Oh, and I noticed something while coding, I believe prunplanner daily cost in the overview does not include degradation cost, which is something I expected it did since it's mentioned in the cost of goods manufactured


[03-Mar-24 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
It doesn't afaik.

Despite the fact I've seen several people claim it does.


[03-Mar-24 03:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
But if you add up the cost of all the materials it perfectly matches the cost per day with no room for degredation.


[03-Mar-24 05:18 PM] jvaler#0000
i had no idea it didn't wth
if it's already a thing in the CoGM why wouldn't it be included...


[03-Mar-24 05:25 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
When I messaged them about it they just said they thought it was included


[03-Mar-24 05:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[05-Mar-24 04:38 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
yeah that question gets complicated, some people have *really* gotten into the specifics of the best time to repair for any building based on what you're making. If that interests you go for it, there's some great tools for it. Most people just repair at 60 or ~80d though.


[06-Mar-24 03:22 AM] flor2081#0000
45 or 90 days is best


[06-Mar-24 03:22 AM] flor2081#0000
also easiest to calculate, repair costs at 90 days are exactly 50% of the initial building cost


[06-Mar-24 03:23 AM] flor2081#0000
but at 90 days your efficiency goes to 80%, so it's best to keep it at 99+% by repairing at 45 days


[06-Mar-24 06:39 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
The efficiency drop is super slow for the first ~80d, so the general rule I've heard is to repair at 80d or right before the material tick before 80d (if the most expensive repair material is needs 3 for the full building, you'll need 1 more for repairs at 60d, so repairing at 50d is most efficient.) 45d seems fast and would be wasting a lot of material for certain buildings yeah?


[06-Mar-24 08:51 AM] flor2081#0000
depends on what special conditions the planet has (AEF, INS, SEA etc) but in a normal green planet the best is 45d or 90d


[06-Mar-24 08:52 AM] flor2081#0000
but yeah in some conditions its best at 60 days


[06-Mar-24 08:53 AM] flor2081#0000
I've heard that AEFs have an ideal repair time at 30 days


[06-Mar-24 08:54 AM] flor2081#0000
also depends on the building, FP, PP1 and CHP for example are best repaired at 30d instead of 45d

I've had a thought,
Should i just switch my Deimos into a full SME base and just extract and smelt my FE i get from phobos and just turn Nike into all PP1's and just buy ALO and smelt it when needed?


[27-Mar-24 05:29 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
and just make my BDE with PE with the PP1's too?


[27-Mar-24 05:29 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
might keep some PP2's for making Lfabs


[27-Mar-24 05:29 PM] talryk#0000
From what I‚Äôve been able to tell, good plan but do PP2s to use AL on bfabs instead?


[27-Mar-24 05:30 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
well i was just going to do PP1's because for the sake of an hour and a bit difference is it really worth all the KOM, REP, EXO etc i would need for PP2's??

[27-Mar-24 05:31 PM] talryk#0000
I definitely think you could swap EXTs for SMEs and make out with more money, though


[27-Mar-24 05:33 PM] talryk#0000
Other than that, though, I was definitely considering much the same


[27-Mar-24 05:34 PM] spekktra_#0000
I must say, PP2 are worthit, yes, u need more types of consumables, but transporting AL vs FE to Nikke is the point, I prefer PP2


[27-Mar-24 05:45 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
only thing is, i would then need to find an ALO planet that i could extract from.


[27-Mar-24 05:45 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Which is do-able, and i could transport that fairly easily when i upgrade my ships


[27-Mar-24 05:46 PM] talryk#0000
Might be ultimately more profitable to import, rather than produce.


[27-Mar-24 05:47 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
so just buy a load of ALO? see i thought about that but then i thought that would eat into my profit quite alot


[27-Mar-24 05:47 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
just kind of still trying to get myself solid and settled.


[27-Mar-24 05:47 PM] spekktra_#0000
Nascent, that's my goal for AL, and maybe I will smelt it on zv-194c üòÖ still not sure


[27-Mar-24 05:48 PM] talryk#0000
Depends! Every now and then some batches of ore go up on the Deimos LM, and the prices are pretty reasonable


[27-Mar-24 05:49 PM] talryk#0000
I‚Äôm still pretty small-scale, so the last batch of 300 I picked up has offset my own production of ore by a lot

i suppose you're right


[27-Mar-24 05:52 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000

no judgement, lol, I'm just joking. but for real, if you extracted SIO, then sold it on FX, then used all that money to buy FEO, you'd probably have more FEO than extracting from Phobos...


[27-Mar-24 07:54 PM] jvaler#0000
like i've looked at my nascent base and it honestly doesn't save me that much money. CoGM is 20/u plus ~25/u for LM ads shipping it nascent -> ANT -> deimos

What is base time for mining on Nascent 1 extraxtor = ??


[27-Mar-24 07:56 PM] jvaler#0000
when ALO on CX is 100/u and on deimos LM is 75/u


[27-Mar-24 07:57 PM] jvaler#0000
base time + CoGC? ~10hrs
add experts and it's ~8hrs

I'm running full smelters on Deimos and have fully switched over to buying ALO on Local Market. I'm only running incinerators on Nascent. I honestly don't think it's worth the time to extract ALO on Nascent and haul it to Deimos. At least not until I get upgraded ships


[27-Mar-24 08:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I mine most of the ALO on Deimos. The difference between full SME and mixed is minimal. The peace of mind and the easier logistics back and forth are worth


[27-Mar-24 08:26 PM] tanda#0000
I agree, that's why I'm just buying on the LM for now. I did find that it's actually a loss to mine ALO on Deimos most of the time, which is why I made the switch


[27-Mar-24 08:42 PM] spekktra_#0000
I think it's worth it when the Nascent will be supply at least 3 players at all.

I‚Äôve set up my second base on Harmonia with a farm setup and an incinerator. I doubt it‚Äôs the most effective, but it works and is close. All I import are OVE, COF and PWO, since RAT and DW are produced on site

Best growing HCP on Harmonia and you can start incinerating there too, but ideally best incinerating it on a resource extraction planet I.e ZV-759g


[29-Mar-24 10:26 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Because incinerators come under resource extraction COGC

Any planet with resource extraction works fine.


[29-Mar-24 03:31 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If you're making AL on Deimos then a common setup is using half of a base on Nascent to extract ALO, and the other half to incinerate GRN from Harmonia ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø pretty efficient


[29-Mar-24 03:35 PM] coolfeather2#0000

[29-Mar-24 05:50 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I just think we don't want people missing out on the opportunity to build bases because they didn't have the mats to build and get the slot before they were all gone.


[29-Mar-24 05:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I am starting a new base soon so might as well join in

I thought I was going to do POL at Electronica but it can wait


[29-Mar-24 05:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I like HER so I just build a CM on Harmonia for later use while I build other bases first. You can always just put down the CM to claim it... just make sure you actually use it and aren't taking up the space for too long with a 'ghost plot'


[29-Mar-24 05:54 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I've already had mine too long üôÉ built the CM, then we ran out of fabs and I changed plans cause real life got busy. I'll probably do that soon though. If I can find someone from KAWA to build a FP base I'll just grow RAT inputs


[29-Mar-24 05:55 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I'm just trying to upgrade my ships rn so i can just haul an asstonne of C to deimos and AL to Nike and just let my Bfab pile up, saves me doing shipments everyday before work lol.

yeah definitely in very small quantities for WIN, but that's really profitable. you're right though DW is good. Might as well just build on a food planet for that though if you're going all in on it

@thisaccountissponsoredbymcdonald okay so this is what a max WPL base would look like. you get a free PPF making PSL (thing needed for base core modules) because it fits very neatly into the 500 area you get from 1 permit. 

now KV seems to be quite profitable but it's TCL input is quite costly. however supply doesn't seem to be an issue like i had thought, the CX is actually decently stocked

i'm just worried you won't be able to keep up production if you build all that. that IND consumption/d is more than has been traded on the CX in weeks. 

what exists on the CXOB right now would only last ~2 weeks and i doubt it would get refilled in time because of what i said earlier about people only making it to consume themselves

Nothing particularly close. Maybe I‚Äôm just still in the small-scale thinking stages. It‚Äôs hard to grasp what‚Äôs a lot or a little when I haven‚Äôt dipped my feet in yet


[01-Apr-24 02:05 PM] tanda#0000
I think running rigs/col/ext on a planet while you're getting your supply lines under control is a valid idea


[01-Apr-24 02:06 PM] tanda#0000
doesn't scale great, though


[01-Apr-24 02:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ice Station Alpha is a good option.


[01-Apr-24 02:09 PM] tanda#0000
once my water needs increase greatly, I plan on setting up a base there. But the amount of water that place can provide is just unnecssary for carbon farming on Harmonia


[01-Apr-24 02:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe so, but it could be useful for doing a larger scale consumable production.


[01-Apr-24 02:10 PM] talryk#0000
I‚Äôm still spreading out, can‚Äôt expand too far too quickly.


[01-Apr-24 02:10 PM] tanda#0000
I am feeling a little stretched thin with just my starter ships and the 4 bases I'm currently running, so I think that's wise


[01-Apr-24 02:17 PM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
Ooo. Can I increase the ask to include setting up a base on Ice Station Alpha?

So is it max 5 jumps from the Deimos system for the grant? I am looking for a good ALO planet, and I guess I won't get a base on Deimos

Who was is that mentioned wanting to pull the price of PSL down? Vipo and I are about to do what we can. They make more than enough to fully supply the demand at BEN and ANT, but once the price starts dropping it'll get taken to MOR, which has *way* higher demand. We'll see what we can do though

If you're selling at ANT I can build up a bigger supply and go sell directly to MOR instead of ANT


[07-Apr-24 06:50 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
For PSL I mean


[07-Apr-24 06:50 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000

16 PSL/day


[07-Apr-24 06:53 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Nice. That's most of the average daily volume at ANT I think so that should pull it down pretty good (and make you some good money)


[07-Apr-24 06:54 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Vipo is making almost 50/d, which isn't even half of what MOR moves... üôÉ

What do you think about this Lfab plan for Aceland? It is meant to be pretty self sufficient, hence why I place it there.

so you can get rid of the CM, because you already have that built

so you could se tyou FRMS to like plan 5, but put the building bit to 2 since you already have 3 built

OK, looks like I maybe drop the FP and go for 6 RIG and 11 FRM total. That takes me to 495/500 used space (but I do have 70 remaining in HB1 for Pioneers)

Not usually, no.

It makes logistics easier, sure, but it comes a point where another farm outweighs the cost of H2O, especially from a source like Harmonia.

For example on Deimos there's a setup that nets you around 30/40k a day profit and pretty much negates your ALO and O logistical needs but has a lower profit than a full smelter base.


[14-Apr-24 12:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you can stomach the logistics, which at your stage you definitely should be able to with two starters and one base, you'll be fine.

don't worry about the BBH, BSE and MCG, i can cover that in a day or 2 if you focus on the BDE and BTA

[15-Apr-24 04:25 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I've decided to hold off on the Nascent base for now, worked it out that it'll cost me more for the upkeep than it would be to just buy ALO of Deimos LM

that's honestly the move

doesn't need to be on nascent. there's plenty of other resource extraction planets


[15-Apr-24 07:15 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
I feel like resource_extract or C smelting should be put on random planets and now ones that are abundant with ALO etc

deimos and nascent ALO deposits are identical, if it became metallurgy it'd literally be a second deimos

does that make sense or should the buildings be more diversified?


[15-Apr-24 11:02 AM] evany.#0000
i believe the advice youll get is 0 EXT 15 SME- infact the opposite less diversification so that you get your 5 experts faster and they are more beneficial while simultaneously getting the benefits of cogc


[15-Apr-24 11:03 AM] m3tzg3r#0000
hmm seems counter intuitive


[15-Apr-24 11:04 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You can build a max if 20


[15-Apr-24 11:04 AM] .urpalhal#0000
The CoGC will boost the SME but not the EXT making the efficiency higher


[15-Apr-24 11:05 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Also if all 5 experts are for Smelting then the efficiency is higher as well


[15-Apr-24 11:06 AM] m3tzg3r#0000
ok and then just buy ALO?


[15-Apr-24 11:06 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah


[15-Apr-24 11:07 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You can usually buy it from the local market for 75AIC/u


[15-Apr-24 11:08 AM] m3tzg3r#0000
theres just one offer for 100ALO@91AIC/u


[15-Apr-24 11:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[15-Apr-24 11:09 AM] .urpalhal#0000

Especially if the people with a 500 area smelter base start producing their own bfabs with their supply, the market supply should decrease.

COF seems expensive..


[15-Apr-24 11:42 AM] jvaler#0000
luxury consumables are basically always worth it. if they aren't that means your profits are unreasonably low and there's likely issues with your plan


[15-Apr-24 11:42 AM] jvaler#0000
because all they do is increase your efficiency(crafting speed) which amplifies whatever profits you already have

[15-Apr-24 11:49 AM] m3tzg3r#0000
ah ok


[15-Apr-24 11:49 AM] jvaler#0000
with current prices a 20 SME AL base should be ~50d ROI (still abysmal, ~20 to 30d ROI is standard for decent profits)


[15-Apr-24 11:49 AM] m3tzg3r#0000
so i need to get FLX as well


[15-Apr-24 11:50 AM] archielvahr#0000
For me, the profits from my AL comes from turning it into fabs on Nike


[15-Apr-24 11:50 AM] m3tzg3r#0000
ok that took it down to 43d ROI


[15-Apr-24 11:51 AM] jvaler#0000
that AL could have been bought from the CX for 550/u. you gotta think of it as if you're selling the AL to yourself


[15-Apr-24 11:51 AM] jvaler#0000
so just cause u use it yourself doesn't make the profits any different


[15-Apr-24 11:52 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah definitely true


[15-Apr-24 11:53 AM] archielvahr#0000
Although my Deimos base is 600 days old so... it's a long term decision as prices fluctuate


[15-Apr-24 11:53 AM] sidepipe#0000
That gets to the question of how you value prices like that in prunplanner when you provide a lot of your own inputs. I'm pretty vertically integrated, so I like to set the buy price for the stuff I make to the COGM for each, and then each base making inputs provides basically no profits and it's all 'realized' at the final stage


[15-Apr-24 11:54 AM] archielvahr#0000
I think AL is always in stock, unlike a lot of other things in my chains


[15-Apr-24 11:56 AM] jvaler#0000
my deimos base is also old, except i've got a private deal from back when AL.AI1 was higher where someone buys my AL at a set price so i'm pretty much immune to the market üòõ

[15-Apr-24 11:56 AM] jvaler#0000
i used to do that too, until i realized it makes it pretty impossible to determine the value any individual base actually provides you


[15-Apr-24 12:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
That's a very important caveat. All accounting is wrong, but some is more useful than others üòÑ


[15-Apr-24 12:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
I also have an exchange preference with buy and sell at avg, with the idea that that still captures some of the cross-subsidy, but also still reflects the profits of individual bases well enough to make decisions


[15-Apr-24 12:02 PM] jvaler#0000
cross-subsidy?


[15-Apr-24 12:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
i make h20 which makes my rats and dw cheaper which I use as inputs to all my other bases which makes the other things cheaper etc etc. maybe cross-subsidy isn't the right word for it


[15-Apr-24 12:03 PM] sidepipe#0000
but I'm not opposed to confidently using the wrong word üòÑ


[15-Apr-24 12:03 PM] jvaler#0000

[15-Apr-24 12:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've been thinking about making a tool (or at least a spreadsheet) for that sort of thing that can adequately capture the whole 'I sell X RATs at COGM to myself for upkeep, I sell the rest at ask/bid to the market', but haven't really had the time to play with it yet


[15-Apr-24 12:07 PM] archielvahr#0000
I actually made a sheet to do that, with a ton of iterative circular calculations- because even extracting water uses DW... and making bfabs for the RIGs uses DW, which uses H2O, etc

[15-Apr-24 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd love to take a look at it if you're willing to share. I'm interested at comparing what comes out of it vs what prunplanner shows with all the COGM settings. Just to see how wrong my accounting actually is


[15-Apr-24 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
One of my big goals was to evaluate the markup of each MM item in isolation.


[15-Apr-24 12:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
For niche products, you have to be aware of the amount you can actually sell. Markup on LFEs is great, but I have 100+ unsold ones.


[15-Apr-24 12:20 PM] archielvahr#0000
MMs you can sell in any quantity.. So it's nice to know the minimum price of those, plus some idea of the price at each stage, in case there are opportunities to buy precursors.


[15-Apr-24 12:21 PM] archielvahr#0000
Then I also calculate the total area per day required to make $1 with each MM


[15-Apr-24 12:22 PM] archielvahr#0000
Since there was a big discussion of some otherwise good-looking MMs that just take too much area. (or are made really slowly). AIR actually came out looking pretty good, but there were some concerns since APFs are big and slow


[15-Apr-24 12:23 PM] archielvahr#0000
I don't think I have taxes in the sheet though, and also google sheets tends to barf pretty bad sometimes on the iterative calculations. It helps to toggle them on and off. Sometimes it will seem to take 5+ minutes to calculate. Dunno what's up with that. It's almost so slow and unreliable to be useless üòï

I did mitigate some of the performance issues by breaking the circular loops by making value-only copies of some cells


[15-Apr-24 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
so the sheet might be a mess, I don't know what was up when I stopped working on it. i think a manual calculate/download prices button might help. but that would be a lot of AppScripting


[15-Apr-24 12:25 PM] jvaler#0000
don't let firefreak hear you say that


[15-Apr-24 12:25 PM] archielvahr#0000
Heh yeah I haven't used any other spreadsheet software in 15+ years so I don't know if anything else would do better


[15-Apr-24 12:27 PM] archielvahr#0000
Oh I also made some assumptions about extractor rates that could be tweaked to be more agressive


[15-Apr-24 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Really, the biggest condemnation of this approach (and idea in general) is that the calculations are so hard the results are probably useless if you half-ass it, (like I did)


[15-Apr-24 12:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
This is very cool, thanks! Hopefully I can steal some ideas from it for my use-case, I didn't consider that you'd have to loop around and re-calculate input prices


[15-Apr-24 12:35 PM] archielvahr#0000
If I redid it, maybe I would set price overrides for all the EXT goods and work from there


[15-Apr-24 12:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
maybe this is an excuse for me to finally read up on linear programming üòÑ


[15-Apr-24 12:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
i'd been thinking a lot about how each 'true' price (if you want to call it that) is just some linear function of the prices of the input goods (consumed directly or as overhead)


[15-Apr-24 12:43 PM] tanda#0000
That sounds like a fantastic spreadsheet. I was just doing a baby version of that this weekend. I'm going to take a look at your calcs when I get home

How much PG do y'all guess we'd need to make to mess with the price ?


[19-Apr-24 06:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
A lot


[19-Apr-24 06:32 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I wanna try to plan out how many of each base we'd need for the hypothetical PG crash


[19-Apr-24 06:33 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Weekly trade at AI1 is ~160,000 rn


[19-Apr-24 06:33 PM] spekktra_#0000
I wanted to say about 30k per day


[19-Apr-24 06:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
My guess was ~11k daily ((160,000 * 50%) / 7). I think it would be a start


[19-Apr-24 06:35 PM] spekktra_#0000
Sounds reasonable


[19-Apr-24 06:35 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
30k daily is more than CI1 and IC1 trade this week combined


[19-Apr-24 06:35 PM] spekktra_#0000
Ouch, my bad, it was just raw guess üôÇ


[19-Apr-24 06:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I think we might be able to convert some of the people EPO people as well to make PG (if we are short on people)


[19-Apr-24 06:38 PM] spekktra_#0000
ANT is short on PG?


[19-Apr-24 06:39 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We (ADI) might be short on people to control the amount of PG bases we would need


[19-Apr-24 06:40 PM] acramernc#0000
why are we crashing the pg market?


[19-Apr-24 06:41 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I thought it would be fun and also help out in Antares across the board since it's used in so many commodities


[19-Apr-24 06:41 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
In my humble opinion it is overpriced


[19-Apr-24 06:43 PM] jvaler#0000
if ADI somehow doesn't have enough people to affect PG maybe it's not overpriced lol

there's lots of people in here, surely it can be done


[19-Apr-24 06:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Really doesn't look that bad. One 125% base can pump out 4.5k


[19-Apr-24 06:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'd throw in a permit - I'm always happy to ~~crash a market~~ adjust prices


[19-Apr-24 06:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
3 bases would likely be enough


[19-Apr-24 06:45 PM] jvaler#0000
only 3? ADI has at least 3 people i think... lmao

[19-Apr-24 06:46 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't know how much exactly we need to make. Especially considering after we lower the price, the cheaper PG could start moving across all 4 CXs


[19-Apr-24 06:47 PM] jvaler#0000
unfortunately i have my own plans atm, so unless someone spoonfeeds me the resources to get something like ZV-759d built i'm out for now lol


[19-Apr-24 06:48 PM] jvaler#0000
well if dvorak thinks the price should be lower than 39, selling it to gaia at that price is just extra money right?


[19-Apr-24 06:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
there's no harm in starting 'small' with 3 bases plus supporting infrastructure and seeing how things go. worst case, we make some extra money on plastic


[19-Apr-24 06:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
~90k/day with no experts is pretty darn good

Most of the price of PG is from C. The bases combined would be eating 300-333/day. I'll look if it's worth making bases to supply the C later but if somebody more knowledgeable about agri stuff would like to figure it out, go ahead

i think if we can get it below 39.0 that would be apretty big victory

I looked at the supply of all the inputs for PG and I think MG might actually be the problem.

it doesn't even need COGC bonus to work


[19-Apr-24 11:05 PM] tanda#0000

[19-Apr-24 11:05 PM] tanda#0000
same number of extractors even


[19-Apr-24 11:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
So far I got that if we decide to sell PG at 35/u, we'd be making 50k at 100% efficiency and 91k at full experts and CoGC. Thoughts ?

Not too shabby


[19-Apr-24 11:32 PM] tanda#0000
hmm, Elon is within spitting distance of Nascent, so there should be a good supply of Carbon too

If you could make the MG on the spot too, that'd be neat. Otherwise a base setup for MG on Elon is already making more than enough

I don't really think that's too necessary, though if you did that I could cut down on extractors a bit

with the MGS you extract, this plan could bump up BMPs to push out another 200 MG a day


[19-Apr-24 11:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We only need 350/day for the three bases, possibly more if 3 bases isn't enough

that makes this base really cheap then

nevermind, reducing the EXT while maintaining CLI and AUO levels and fitting in BMP to consume the MGS is just entirely awkward. the HB1 do not like it

Wont your PG chain oversupply the current CX demand?


[19-Apr-24 11:45 PM] jvaler#0000

[19-Apr-24 11:46 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è People would start using cheap PG for more stuff like DW and BDE. Also some extra will be shipped to other CXs for arbitrage

84.17/d can make up to 673.36 MG/d


[19-Apr-24 11:47 PM] jvaler#0000

you don't have to match 84.17/d, that's just my maximum. i'd prefer it if it was less even cause that's more CLI to rise üòõ


[19-Apr-24 11:50 PM] tanda#0000
matching demand to what's projected (350/d) I would need 64.2 input per day

Depends on the scale of carbon you need. For myself I couldn't squeeze enough out of Phobos, a similar planet, for it to feed both carbon my large scale smelteries and rations to feed my empire, not to mention I had already moved drinking water production to the Ice station in my plan as well. If you are planning to scale up may be best to let a farm planet focus on a single task so far in my opninon

the general consensus is to build strictly towards the planet's COGC. This is due to the rather strong 25% boost to production speed the COGC provides


[21-Apr-24 12:43 AM] tanda#0000
I am starting to find this is not true in all circumstances, but I can definitely speak to that specific application


[21-Apr-24 12:43 AM] tanda#0000
don't make C on Harmonia, export your grown products to Nascent and make C there


[21-Apr-24 12:43 AM] seacilia#0000
That being said Harmonia is a way better farm planet for that reason so it may be more feasable


[21-Apr-24 12:44 AM] seacilia#0000
Just yeah have a manufactory off world that you export agri products to


[21-Apr-24 12:45 AM] seacilia#0000
FP or INC. Inc gets bonuses from resource production COGC


[21-Apr-24 12:45 AM] tanda#0000
Norwick is the local FP planet for Harmonia


[21-Apr-24 12:56 AM] jvaler#0000
imo carbon isn't very profitable atm. you may as well just be straight up selling the agri input to the CX instead of turning it into C and you'll get equivalent profits

Interesting..


[21-Apr-24 12:57 AM] jvaler#0000
but then you don't get to utilize your agri experts for your INC so it ends up being worse than just 13 FRMs

that's incredible, since C has been rising for the last week


[21-Apr-24 12:58 AM] pitic_heavy_industries#0000
Really? Is that normal in the Antares area?


[21-Apr-24 12:58 AM] jvaler#0000
C has been like this for months afaik


[21-Apr-24 12:59 AM] seacilia#0000
I'm sure its still worth it if you're going for the SME route because the inputs are still low, just takes time, but that is astonishing considering how many people I've seen in global mentioning buying C


[21-Apr-24 01:00 AM] jvaler#0000
like i talked about earlier, it's the new player misconception of "if i make it myself, it's free". they don't consider that there's more profitable things to focus on than covering for the stuff you buy off the CX


[21-Apr-24 01:00 AM] jvaler#0000
i used to think the same way and complain about C prices lmfao


[21-Apr-24 01:00 AM] jvaler#0000
but i realize now it's priced well, if a little low even


[21-Apr-24 01:01 AM] seacilia#0000
Totes, right gotta remember that, I pulled myself off rations now I have to consider applying the idea elsewhere as well.


[21-Apr-24 01:02 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
We're planning to mess with the PG price if you are interested in the near future


[21-Apr-24 01:03 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Should be ~50k/day at 100% efficiency


[21-Apr-24 01:03 AM] seacilia#0000
Intersting, I already though the price was really low, I was avoiding doing plastics myself for that reason. Importing seemed very profitable.


[21-Apr-24 01:04 AM] jvaler#0000
...which will end up being ~80k/d because bases don't run at 100% they run at 160% with 5 experts and CoGC üòí

[21-Apr-24 01:05 AM] jvaler#0000
in the context of co-op projects, the point is to maximize efficiency utilization by not splitting industries in a single base.


[21-Apr-24 01:05 AM] jvaler#0000
so ideally the efficiencies don't stray from 160% lol

wait this isn't how you'd calculate profits anyways, if you're splitting by shares like AA efficiency rates don't matter


[21-Apr-24 01:07 AM] jvaler#0000
amount of end product and number of permits is all you care about


[21-Apr-24 01:08 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
A co-op share system sounds annoying to manage, I had just consistent (higher) prices for MG in mind


[21-Apr-24 01:08 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
A base at ***100%*** makes 80k rn so it's pretty wild for a basic material like that

Ahhh, I understand

[21-Apr-24 01:14 AM] jvaler#0000
i'm planning on finally making my HYF base soon (2 weeks minimum) once i get my money back from a loan i gave out, so i could look into seeing if there's extra prod open for HCP

considering this plan for PG production does not include C production to compensate, we Will be increasing the price of C

[21-Apr-24 01:17 AM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah you can tell the price has reached it's lowest, cause people realize selling it for any lower makes it not worth it to produce

I was planning a manufacturing base on Hephaestus which would include PG. Just to clarify, is the need for PG production on Elon, or just in general for ADI needs ?

PG is chemistry and not manufacturing. PE is manufacturing. We don't need the PG for ourselves, we are trying to crash the price


[22-Apr-24 02:22 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We are setting up on Elon because it has the CoGC and because we can make MG on the spot there, which there isn't enough on the CX

[25-Apr-24 10:17 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Order one from Highlander Ships, their deal is on the UFO discord. Their wait time is super long, but that gives you time to save the money because they don't take payment until it's finished. Also definitely the best prices in the game for full kits. Almost as cheap as KAWAs internal ship prices, which is crazy

the margins on AUO EXT are pretty middling because it's relatively cheap on the CX already

i'm sorry i'm spreading misinformation... AUO is actually pretty good now. seems the person who bought and is reselling all the AUO changed the price to be more reasonable

Sounds like we can supply more if needed, @acramernc @m3tzg3r @evany. Are y'all still interested and do you have any cash on hand like leftovers from the grant ? Basically how much more would you all need ?


[26-Apr-24 08:14 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The base plan: https://prunplanner.org/shared/b95023be-6403-4751-bb2d-4299f0b709d9 (You can try building mixed housing but that's more $$$ just for 1 more POL)

all of it lol


[26-Apr-24 08:17 PM] acramernc#0000
it's mostly grant money so i figurte that's what its for


[26-Apr-24 08:21 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Estimation of funding required as of now (1.5mil for base, 200k for inputs):
@acramernc - 640,000$
@m3tzg3r - 1.7 mil
@evany. - 1.7 mil

(One of these can be paid with sidepipe's help)

Total - 2,340,000$

Actually I can just give the 200 LBH


[26-Apr-24 09:13 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

280 lbh


[26-Apr-24 09:29 PM] archielvahr#0000
The plan is 3 bases of 24 POL each, all making PG? Or EPO too?
Is the PG for sale on the CX, or is there a particular use case planned?


[26-Apr-24 09:32 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
All planned to be sold on the CX. If we start producing too much we switch some POL to EPO and if we somehow make too much EPO, we switch to a different chem building


[26-Apr-24 09:32 PM] nyanism#0000
switching building type shouldnt be in the plan?


[26-Apr-24 09:33 PM] nyanism#0000
it does cost tons of monie


[26-Apr-24 09:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If we make way too much PG AND EPO that nobody's buying it anymore we'll need to change plan, but I am humble enough to say that's not happening


[26-Apr-24 09:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
EPO is good money and you won't oversaturate that market, although you will need a plan for the CL.


[26-Apr-24 09:34 PM] archielvahr#0000
didja all get your 750k yet?


[26-Apr-24 11:14 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I think some of them have?


[26-Apr-24 11:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
280 + Hal's 200 should be good enough, the rest we can fill with CX


[27-Apr-24 05:11 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i probably won't be selling too much for a few days as i stock up ANT, feel bad everytime someone asks me for stuff and i ain't got it available

I can't speak for the others, but I'd be open to sponsoring one of the bases as either a grant or 0% interest loan with a pretty long term, whichever you'd be comfortable with


[27-Apr-24 03:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
50/50 grant/loan sound good ? Either way it'd be a solid chunk off of the bill

I'll update this one over time. ~2.3mil to go


[27-Apr-24 03:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
If this goes well we should try something like this on more markets. Become the inarguable #1 CX. If we just kept taking tons of free money we'd run out of steam quick.

Actual price tag likely lower because of Hal's 200 LBH and Nyannisms's 280


[27-Apr-24 04:11 PM] nyanism#0000
theres actually gonna be more of those LBH from both of us eventually, when would you like them delivered btw?

Putting a STO is fine, one POL isn't changing anything. As long as the base has about 20 POL I don't care about the exact base layout. Just communicate how much MG you'll be needing to @tanda

@Deleted User @sidepipe Could you start giving funds ? The distribution should go something like this:


[30-Apr-24 12:54 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Instinct gets the 640,000 from Australis, the others get 830,000 each from him. Then Sidepipe gives a 425,000 grant to each Metzget and Evayoo and 425,000 in loan (Discuss what period of time would work but I think 7 weeks or longer is fine)


[30-Apr-24 01:21 PM] sidepipe#0000
That works for me - are @m3tzg3r and @evany. okay with taking 0% loans? If not, I can do grants for the whole amount, either works for me. Just let me know what you prefer üôÇ

Hello, folks. Please, advice.

I've somewhat completed my construction pipeline at Nike with aluminum and glass from Deimos. I have 6 PP2 and 6 smelters for `AL` (and two glass furnaces). And I'm kinda stuck with what to do next?

Biggest expenses for running this setup are smelting stuff (`C` >> `FLX` >>>> `O`) and basic consumables (`RAT` and `DW`). Should I aim to produce these things to be almost completely self-sustained or move in another direction?


[05-May-24 11:13 AM] tanda#0000
Vertical integration isn't the worst idea, It's what I've done. It helps keeps costs down, but I find it somewhat logistically taxing given size of imports and exports.


[05-May-24 11:14 AM] jvaler#0000
the thing with C is that it *looks* expensive, but making it in the current market isn't actually all that profitable. so you're not "saving" as much as you think you are when that money could be better spent elsewhere(more PP2 imo)


[05-May-24 11:21 AM] jvaler#0000
things aren't suddenly worth less when you make them yourself and happen to consume them yourself. that money you saved comes from avoiding the CX, so it still has value tied to what it would have cost off the CX.

you need to look at each item you want to make self-sufficient and assess if they're profitable to produce alone with no other factors, because that determines how much you're actually saving


[05-May-24 11:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
PrUnPlanner has a function that allows you to see how much it would cost you to make an certain MAT


[05-May-24 11:25 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I would look there


[05-May-24 11:28 AM] jvaler#0000
that's divorced from the product's value and leads to distorted perspectives on what's worth to produce
the main screen already shows you delta profit without building degradation and that doesn't make much difference


[05-May-24 11:30 AM] .urpalhal#0000
That‚Äôs true it does have that


[05-May-24 12:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
From a different perspective, you‚Äôd probably want two bases to make C (like harmonia and nascent, I think) - so I‚Äôd just look at those on their own and see how much you‚Äôd make selling on the CX. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve started evaluating these things. If they‚Äôre profitable on their own, they‚Äôre probably worth building

If I were in your shoes, I'd just make whatever is most profitable and aligns with my end game goal (mine is to produce whatever helps people colonize) and not bother trying to be self-reliant.


[05-May-24 01:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[08-May-24 06:19 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
we build a whole base of PPFs for shipbuilding, but we don't have the next base in the supply line running yet, so they're just making all PSL to dump on the market to fund the next base ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

[10-May-24 01:11 PM] jvaler#0000
it's got identical construction material requirements as A2J too so if you deconstruct ASAP you could reuse most of your materials


[10-May-24 01:14 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah settling new planets is a bit more work than just plopping a base down unfortunately @avalock 
if you don't supply population infrastructure your workers will migrate away


[10-May-24 01:15 PM] avalock#0000
ahhhh heard


[10-May-24 01:15 PM] jvaler#0000

i dont think you need to supply any popi at all for just a pio base

ohh that's right the life support metric


[10-May-24 01:16 PM] flor2081#0000

WU-070a is the main SIO supply of antares afaik. it has a metallurgy CoGC to smelt on-site


[10-May-24 01:18 PM] jvaler#0000
i think because the deposits are so rich you don't need many EXT to supply the SME


[10-May-24 01:19 PM] avalock#0000
heard, so i could sell to local market too


[10-May-24 01:19 PM] jvaler#0000

don't actually do that, you haven't gottem a harmonia or norwick base yet

the MGS is rich too and apparently even more profitable


[10-May-24 01:28 PM] avalock#0000
i wonder how much volume MGS has


[10-May-24 01:29 PM] jvaler#0000
but the daily/weekly traded units on CXM are kinda low so be careful with that
full MGS out of 14 EXT is 493/d which dwarfs the traded volume

yeeee


[10-May-24 01:31 PM] avalock#0000
tho gold demand is high


[10-May-24 01:31 PM] avalock#0000
well higher than supp


[10-May-24 01:31 PM] avalock#0000
but ship space


[10-May-24 01:31 PM] jvaler#0000
that's cause of rise's big order acting as the market maker


[10-May-24 01:32 PM] avalock#0000
ahhhh


[10-May-24 01:32 PM] jvaler#0000
so you could sell kinda indefinitely into that at 200/u, but that's mediocre profits

i gotta go pick my brother up now tho


[10-May-24 01:32 PM] jvaler#0000

[10-May-24 01:34 PM] jvaler#0000

can't check right now but pretty meh if not outright bad i predict


[10-May-24 04:50 PM] jvaler#0000
has worse deposits than WU-070a on top of not having a relevant CoGC

okay then maybe it'd be fine

it's COGC is food which :Bleh: but that number looked good and I was like

:chaewonVibin:


[10-May-24 04:52 PM] jvaler#0000
well WU-070a is also metallurgy so if you're not smelting on-site it makes no difference either way


[10-May-24 04:52 PM] avalock#0000
yeah true, I'm probably not :hehe:

Oh.


[10-May-24 10:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean we don't typically do a 2nd grant, since the idea is the 750k, any additional money after that is typically as needed and if things align.


[10-May-24 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
If we had people regularly taking 2nd grants that may put too much pressure on the funding.

What should I grown on harmonia? GRN or HCP?

depends, i do HCP because i farm my own C


[11-May-24 01:15 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
but might be better off making GRN if you want to make RAT

[11-May-24 01:16 PM] akyantor#0000

You probably don't want to buy agri products like that.

@uncle_leslie69 @.urpalhal for single input :carbon: GRN is strictly superior, HCP is considerably slower to grow

[11-May-24 01:21 PM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I think that's why I settled on GRN as I was growing my own to make C


[11-May-24 01:21 PM] akyantor#0000
I've not experimented with trying to multi-ingredient recipes to see if some other combination is better


[11-May-24 01:21 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
but do you not need 2 plants types?


[11-May-24 01:21 PM] realharvey#0000
you can run any recipe. Depending on the inputs it will be slower or faster at producing carbon


[11-May-24 01:22 PM] jvaler#0000
that's why i specified single input


[11-May-24 01:23 PM] jvaler#0000
if you're looking at double input then your choices are between GRN and MAI because HCP is a given

so that's why i run GRN+HCP in my nascent :INC:


[11-May-24 01:27 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
hmm, i just need to utilise my Harmonia base more, because i'm running low on C


[11-May-24 01:27 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
like i use more than i make


[11-May-24 01:27 PM] akyantor#0000
I probably need to do some reoptimisation, as I think the HCP/GRN may make more sense now I have more than one farm.


[11-May-24 01:27 PM] akyantor#0000
I didn't really look at it again after expanding. :S

oh wow


[11-May-24 01:30 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
but i'm about to upgrade my PG & Manufacturing base so i need more C for PG as well as more for my AL


[11-May-24 01:31 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
so yeah, running dry lol


[11-May-24 01:33 PM] realharvey#0000
My bases consume around 100 C a day. I produce none of that üòÖ


[11-May-24 01:34 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i think i'll need to just start using my own C for PG/Manu


[11-May-24 01:34 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
and buy C for AL


[11-May-24 01:34 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
only option really, don't have enough to do all without making another base


[11-May-24 01:34 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
could look into nascent in the future


[11-May-24 01:37 PM] jvaler#0000
okay with 13 FRM you can produce GRN:HCP at 5:2 and consume it double input:single input at 1:2
166/d is about the most C you can get out of that

quick testing shows a 3:4 GRN:HCP ratio fits decently into a 14:3 double input:single input ratio

it's just trial and error, but not entirely blind
you can recognize which direction you're off by and close in on it with more and more precision
you just have to balance precision with how long you make your order times

I did wonder the same. I had a look at the internal prices offered, and doesn't look like anyone is regularly providing EPO & PG. I was thinking of going that route perhaps. If that would be helpful.


[12-May-24 10:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
There's multiple people making PG now.


[12-May-24 10:37 AM] akyantor#0000
Maybe just not on the most recent version of the sheet.


[12-May-24 10:38 AM] histidinedwarf#0000

EPO is still good but I am worried it will go down by a lot too if PG producers switch

tbh, the number of potential directions to go is somewhat bewildering. Trying to plan out my next step, but need to build up cash for the next expansion first, so time to give it thought.

[12-May-24 10:45 AM] akyantor#0000
At the moment, I'm down the Carbon / simple plastics route, which was simply as that looked like a fairly straightforward way to roll some of the C I'm making into something that made a higher profit margin.

My personal goal is making the colonization of farther planets easier, because I think it's cool, so I try to make fabs, red planet consumables, and infrastructure consumables. You could also do that, you could be making ship parts or fuel (fuel profit gone up recently) or booze for higher tier pops

There's a lot of in-corp trading for higher tier stuff so I think it'd neat to help supply those things on the CX, like R and A fabs


[12-May-24 10:55 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
A mixed PP3 and PP2 base would be making bank rn (like mine)

[12-May-24 10:56 AM] realharvey#0000
I agree on this. I am doing the same. But I do provide almost all MAT's for that other than AL and STL myself


[12-May-24 10:57 AM] akyantor#0000
I've dabbled a little in slightly further along materials. Made a couple of batches of NR, which to my surprise sold surprisingly quickly given the order chart looked like relatively thin trading.


[12-May-24 10:57 AM] akyantor#0000
I think that's a building block for the more complex A fabs


[12-May-24 10:58 AM] realharvey#0000
yeah sometimes you can get lucky with that. I posted a decent chunk of RSE recently and it got all bought up in minutes


[12-May-24 10:59 AM] akyantor#0000
I don't know that I'd want to go mad focusing on just that, as for someone early on doesn't look like purchases are all that regular.


[12-May-24 10:59 AM] akyantor#0000
But might be a way into building construction modules for me later on


[12-May-24 11:00 AM] realharvey#0000
It can certainly be difficult. Some products take a day to sell and others a week or even more. At the beginning it is quite difficult to keep the base running when the stuff is not selling


[12-May-24 11:00 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's why I've started doing EPO, and selling an overage of C... they look like they're always in demand, so will be reliable enough to keep paying the bills at the start.


[12-May-24 11:01 AM] realharvey#0000
you can also switch to PG pretty easy


[12-May-24 11:01 AM] realharvey#0000
that CL can get expensive for EPO tho.


[12-May-24 11:02 AM] akyantor#0000
I've a base on Griffenstone so have been making my own CL too. Though now I seem to have a pile of NA that isn't seemingly worth very much as a biproduct.


[12-May-24 11:03 AM] realharvey#0000
thats a solid plan. You reduce your own risk by alot


[12-May-24 11:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
@akyantor depending on the route you want to take, the NA can be turned into THF for INS. And you can use your CL and C for DDT as well

I did see that was an option. Found a planet that has the AMM, so could be self sufficient in production. I wasn't sure how in demand THF was though.


[12-May-24 11:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
not super on it's own, though you can sell batches of it every now and then. the extra step to turn it into INS is expensive, but worthwhile

You're way ahead of where I was 22 days in üòÑ


[12-May-24 11:08 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
And in general if it's available on the CX it's probably not needed to make it yourself


[12-May-24 11:09 AM] sidepipe#0000
atm I make ~590 INS a day, which consumes ~25 THF a day. So what's on the CX would last you for quite a while


[12-May-24 11:10 AM] akyantor#0000
I hadn't really looked at DTT. An interesting option, as have most of the ingredients already... just would need to mine more to get the CL.


[12-May-24 11:11 AM] akyantor#0000
I also thought about getting my own H... but seems very thin margins on that and would require a lot of logistics as you'd have to sell in bulk.


[12-May-24 11:12 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
A lot of logistics for something you buy at the CX for dirt cheap...

A healthy ADI grant certainly helped. Also had a 1% loan from someone on Harmonia for 200k. Just need to pay that down now with profits from the production line head start I received.

pretty regularly - I post another 100 every week or so


[12-May-24 11:16 AM] sidepipe#0000
not to tell all my secrets, but there's also good arbitrage opportunities between the different CXs for it quite often

[12-May-24 11:17 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess if you're already doing a bunch of food production, it's a perk to sell any overage of DTT

[12-May-24 11:19 AM] sidepipe#0000
I have a full base of labs making mostly DDT. I'd recommend a smaller scale and using some of the labs for something else if you go that route, unless you plan on using the DDT yourself. There can definitely be times where it sits in inventory for a while (so if you go full-bore into DDT I can't guarantee you'd be able to sell all of it at ANT)


[12-May-24 11:23 AM] akyantor#0000
I've a single lab at the moment, which is how I made the NR. I'm probably going to expand chem/polymer plants before labs, as they're quite a bit cheaper to build at the stage I'm at.

[12-May-24 12:19 PM] sidepipe#0000
Sort of? I suppose it depends on your perspective. It's profitable right now (though it's been nerfed several times), but it 
1) injects money into the game to prevent deflation
2) drives up the prices of the input goods (rfabs, FIM, DW etc etc)

I guess that's fair. Not cheap to build.


[12-May-24 12:25 PM] sidepipe#0000
There's definitely mixed views on it. I think it's pretty well balanced overall, since it's pretty expensive to set up, and money in the game needs to come from somewhere. It'd be interesting to see how much of the galaxy's consumables go towards EDC / IDC, but there's probably no way to know for sure

[12-May-24 12:31 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I haven't seen evidence of it protecting against deflation really. I see no reason to believe making the MM price lower would make a big difference until it's actually tried


[12-May-24 12:32 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Literally every single base drives up the costs of input costs, though Rfabs being used more is nice


[12-May-24 12:33 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
A risk free money source for wealthy players that doesn't interact with any other player needs to have a lot of evidence to back up why it should be tolerated


[12-May-24 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
imo, the issue is market makers generally - if you remove EDC / IDC, it would just move to some other good where the MM profit is good enough to be worth generating tons of. Since MMs are the only source of new currency other than 50k per new player and faction contracts, I assume there'd be deflation otherwise


[12-May-24 12:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
In an environment where there are no MMs, it's a lot easier to create new goods than new money, assuming no other changes to the system


[12-May-24 12:37 PM] sidepipe#0000
Even real life has risk-free money sources for wealthy players üòÑ


[12-May-24 12:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
140k risk-free is excessive. It makes EDC the inarguable most optimal strategy if you are wealthy. Real life government treasury bonds don't 10x your money like if you bought into crypto early and even if they did, what happens irl is irrelevant to the game design if it's not fair or fun


[12-May-24 12:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
140k 0 experts + CoGC


[12-May-24 12:42 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The initial investment is high and the ROI slow but that just means only established players get to make use of it


[12-May-24 12:43 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And at the end of the day it's just not fun


[12-May-24 12:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
I'm sure there will be more changes to it in the future. I think they already reduced the MM from 13k to 11.5k recently


[12-May-24 12:45 PM] sidepipe#0000

üëå 

[12-May-24 12:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
but like I said, mixed views. I def don't think this system is a perfect one, but it's also not horrible. I think there's lots of room for player interaction since there's only so many electronics planets and only so many permits (and rfab makers etc etc). I assume long-term they'll lower the price of EDC to where it's not risk free, but then there's probably other MMs that would get targeted instead.


[12-May-24 12:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
imo, the game needs some risk-free source of income since that's one of the big requirements for financialization as we know it. I desperately want to be able to sell futures / options to people, but it just doesn't make sense without a risk-free rate of some sort


[12-May-24 12:49 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Maybe some MM farm for new players would work to keep away deflation. Like some commodity you make with pioneers that gets you 30k daily or smthn


[12-May-24 12:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
(it probably also doesn't because there's no real long-term price risk to worry about with most things that are well-traded enough to sell options for)


[12-May-24 12:49 PM] sidepipe#0000
there's lots of those, but other players buy them for more than the MM üòâ


[12-May-24 12:51 PM] sidepipe#0000
in my dreams, we can buy T-bills from antares (A-bills?)


[12-May-24 12:56 PM] sidepipe#0000
I've thought about this a fair bit - I think part of the problem currently is a lot of the higher tier commodities are used so infrequently that there's not necessarily a huge incentive to move up the chain of production. My big point in favor of EDC is that there's lots of bases consuming those Rfabs and mid-tier consumables to print money. I'd personally prefer to see the money printing even higher up the chain than EDC, since all of the high-tier commodities drive demand for the lower tier stuff. Of course, I have no evidence to back any of this up, either


[12-May-24 12:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's tough to know for sure since a lot of the higher-tier stuff is bought and sold privately anyway


[12-May-24 12:58 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'd like to believe that we can eventually get there with stuff like the PG bases. Make all the low tier stuff not very profitable and make new bases to be made for higher tier stuff, maybe eventually pull the in-corp trading on the CX

Well when the game launched the EDCs were 16k each.
Feb 2023: 16000 ‚Üí 13000
January 2024: 13000 ‚Üí 11500

And still, they weren't the MM of choice for many many months. People were making UTC because the cost of getting engineers and scientists was too high, and many luxury goods weren't available. But as the market matured and everythign became available on the CX... EDCs got really good. And even with the nerfs they are really good.  Probably too good.

They aren't entirely without risk, because the FIM price could go crazy- there's small risk on the supply side and not much on the demand side.. (Although the last dev nerf came in unexpected, and if you are doing an EDC operation, I think you need to take potential EDC nerfs into consideration). 

Anyway, I do think it would be way more fun and interesting to go back to drone manufacture as a MM and money printer

Getting the cheap WCB upgrades for both ships. Should I be worried about getting shipping contracts for them instead of sending out my ships out there ?


[14-May-24 10:17 AM] realharvey#0000
If they are ship upgrades you need the ships there anyway?


[14-May-24 10:18 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Well the plan is to deliver them to ANT and upgrade from the Deimos shipyard or something


[14-May-24 10:18 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't wanna wait 4 days back and forth to use my ships :(


[14-May-24 10:23 AM] realharvey#0000
there is a shipyard in the System of the CX


[14-May-24 10:23 AM] realharvey#0000

[14-May-24 10:24 AM] realharvey#0000

[14-May-24 10:24 AM] realharvey#0000
I'd fly one ship there and use a shipyard over there

otherwise you'll loose alot of time moving it


[14-May-24 10:25 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
I still don't get why not get a shipping contract from MOR to ANT


[14-May-24 10:25 AM] histidinedwarf#0000
Do they take long to be filled ?


[14-May-24 10:26 AM] realharvey#0000
I moved my shipparts from ANT to HRT and I regretted that decision


[14-May-24 10:26 AM] realharvey#0000
I was constantly in fear that someone does not deliver it haha


[14-May-24 10:27 AM] realharvey#0000
Getting them Shipped from MOR to ANT would save your ships time. But I would not build em on deimos


[14-May-24 10:27 AM] realharvey#0000
I'd use that shipyard in ANT

waiting for the shipping from ANT to HRT took me 5 Days


[14-May-24 10:33 AM] sidepipe#0000
You can always send 1 ship, upgrade there, and bring everything else back to ANT. That way you only have one ship out at a time


[14-May-24 10:50 AM] realharvey#0000
This sounds like a good compromise


[14-May-24 10:50 AM] realharvey#0000
I hope that LHP istnt also at MOR. This would take two WCB trips


[14-May-24 11:10 AM] sidepipe#0000
If it is and you don't feel like making two trips, let me know. I'll need some for repairs soon and fly out to MOR semi-regularly, so I can buy it off you at ANT prices & you can just buy what you need at ANT

follow up q uestion as i'm looking to upgrade my ship(s)- do they use more fuel ? is it significant? should i leave one noob-only ship ?


[16-May-24 02:30 PM] evany.#0000
or should i try to upgrade both ships?


[16-May-24 02:30 PM] evany.#0000
i guess i'm asking: is there any negatives associated with upgrading


[16-May-24 02:33 PM] jvaler#0000
being able to carry more weight will cause you to use more fuel, but it's still *way* more efficient than if you were making multiple trips with a smaller cargo bay

the thing with upgrading starters though is that there's no real need to upgrade your reactor or engine because the basic ones work just fine and you won't get any refund for those basic parts.


[16-May-24 02:35 PM] realharvey#0000
Whoever is running all those shipyards is super careless with shipparts that get replaced. It should at least refund a little bit


[16-May-24 02:35 PM] evany.#0000
obviously the majority of my trips my ships aren't full say 300/500t - and if i upgrade both ships it will just be 300/1000t
but situations where earlier in the week i had to do 7 trips with both ships to complete an AL move.. in the future that would only be 3 full trips


[16-May-24 02:35 PM] evany.#0000
but was just wondering if it makes sense to leave one "stock" or upgrade both; its probably a negligent amount though


[16-May-24 02:38 PM] jvaler#0000
the community consensus is that everybody should try to upgrade both of their starters to WCB ships (3000t/1000m^3). the reason it's a WCB and not an LCB (2000t/2000m^3) is because the volume of a ship determines what kind of crew quarters and FTL emitters it requires. because you get no refund you want to minimize the amount of ship parts you need to replace when upgrading. an LCB hits harsher breakpoints for ship infrastructure than a WCB does because of that extra 1000m^3 volume

so even if you ship goods that are 1:1 mass:volume, it's still cheaper and more cost effective to upgrade into WCBs


[16-May-24 02:38 PM] evany.#0000
oh sorry. 3000T not 1000T


[16-May-24 02:39 PM] acramernc#0000
you can always build out a blueprint with `BLU` and test it to see the running cost changes


[16-May-24 02:40 PM] jvaler#0000
a WCB fits 1000 AL, your metallurgy logistics will become a breeze

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[16-May-24 02:41 PM] realharvey#0000
And it's totally worth it to save up for that upgrade instead of a smaller cargo load


[16-May-24 02:42 PM] jvaler#0000
the change in flight time between a starter and an upgraded starter is so negligible it's basically not a consideration, especially because you're keeping the standard engine which is stronger than a fuel saving engine


[16-May-24 02:43 PM] evany.#0000

[16-May-24 07:17 PM] evany.#0000
per whats listed here: https://discord.com/channels/855488309802172469/1202257500213366804/1202257500213366804


[16-May-24 07:17 PM] evany.#0000
i dont see anything listed "WCB" or anything like it though.

you can open those up as MAT buffers


[16-May-24 07:17 PM] jvaler#0000
`MAT WCB` will tell you it's actual name


[16-May-24 07:17 PM] jvaler#0000
aka high load cargo bay

[16-May-24 07:18 PM] evany.#0000
oh ffs lol okok


[16-May-24 07:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
whigh load cargo bay. the 'w' is silent üòÑ


[16-May-24 07:20 PM] sidepipe#0000
that always bothered me because HCB isn't a material


[16-May-24 07:22 PM] evany.#0000
final question then hopefully. how do i compare it to my ship to buy the necessary plates and such that are missing?


[16-May-24 07:22 PM] evany.#0000
i need to price that out to make sure i can afford it


[16-May-24 07:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can start a project at a shipyard to upgrade from your existing ship to the new blueprint


[16-May-24 07:22 PM] sidepipe#0000
and the project will tell you what it needs


[16-May-24 07:23 PM] evany.#0000
that seems.. too late doesn't it ?


[16-May-24 07:23 PM] evany.#0000
he expects me to bring the plates and such when i send the ship


[16-May-24 07:23 PM] evany.#0000
so i just guess how many i need ?


[16-May-24 07:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
you can do it without the ship

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[16-May-24 07:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
so the upgrade won't start until you deliver all the materials and the ship and press start, I believe

{Reactions}

[16-May-24 07:24 PM] jvaler#0000
you'll have to start the shipyard upgrade project to get an evaluation, which locks your blueprint :/
you can always cancel the project, no commitment there, but you can no longer modify or delete the blueprint (only rename it)


[16-May-24 07:25 PM] jvaler#0000
i always read it as "weight cargo bay" as opposed to "volume cargo bay" for VCB


[16-May-24 07:25 PM] jvaler#0000
even though it should be mass...


[16-May-24 07:25 PM] jvaler#0000
but MCB is already taken by the medium cargo bay


[16-May-24 07:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
I like that explanation


[16-May-24 07:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
the LCB holds the most water too, so... liquid cargo bay?


[16-May-24 07:26 PM] jvaler#0000
üß†


[16-May-24 07:32 PM] evany.#0000
sorry maybe i'm confused. 

>  I do not provide the hull plates or SSC needed for the upgrade.

so i need to figure that out
but in order to figure that out  I need to take it to the shipyard which is 40 hours away (at MOR?) 
i have to take a ship there to determine how many plates i need
then come back (another 40 hours) - buy the plates
and send it back again with the plates and upgrade at his ship dock(another 40 hours back)
then wait another ~30 hours for build then another 40hour trip home?

holy hell thats like 8 days im out of commision for i better make sure shit is stocked up lmao


[16-May-24 07:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
okay hold on a second, let me get some screenshots


[16-May-24 07:33 PM] sidepipe#0000
don't send any ships anywhere yet


[16-May-24 07:33 PM] jvaler#0000
nonono you can start a project without anything anywhere


[16-May-24 07:33 PM] evany.#0000
i'm not he isn't ready for 9 days he said


[16-May-24 07:33 PM] evany.#0000
oh. i convert this blueprint into a project?

[16-May-24 07:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
They'll give a better explanation but you only need to send the ship to MOR and back once to get the ship parts, then you buy plates and SSC at ANT and send the ship to a shipyard on some ANT planet to upgrade


[16-May-24 07:34 PM] sidepipe#0000
do `SHY ZV-307c`


[16-May-24 07:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
that's for the shipyard at Hephaestus, just as an example

üëÜ  I'm too slow haha


[16-May-24 07:36 PM] evany.#0000
ah when i did SHYP it just gave me an extra thing with no way to add to it


[16-May-24 07:36 PM] evany.#0000
SHYP zv- works though


[16-May-24 07:36 PM] jvaler#0000
the project will sit waiting for both the materials and ship for however long you want, and both can be fulfilled asynchronously


[16-May-24 07:37 PM] evany.#0000
so i don't need to use him i just need the components from him


[16-May-24 07:37 PM] evany.#0000
realistically i don't even need to go pick it up i can have the components shipped back to ANT


[16-May-24 07:37 PM] evany.#0000
and i can just update it like a proper ANTARES at heph


[16-May-24 07:37 PM] jvaler#0000
SHY not SHYP. SHY is the first screenshot and SHYP is the second screenshot. SHY is the shipyard structure and SHYP is a specific project with an arbitrary identifier code


[16-May-24 07:38 PM] jvaler#0000
exactly


[16-May-24 07:38 PM] jvaler#0000
they're just selling you components and you can construct/upgrade the ship on your own time whenever you want

and more in line with what i expected, i might add


[16-May-24 07:40 PM] evany.#0000
that makes so much more sense

you have no idea how much pain you saved yourself by helping me because when igfloz starts looking at upgrades now ill just screenshare and walk him through it hahahaha

you'll be doing LHP right ü§®


[16-May-24 07:42 PM] evany.#0000
i was looking at LHP!


[16-May-24 07:42 PM] jvaler#0000
oh wonderful lmao
didn't realize you two were together


[16-May-24 07:42 PM] evany.#0000
but its not part of WCB enhanced


[16-May-24 07:43 PM] evany.#0000
we've played crap like this since '08


[16-May-24 07:43 PM] evany.#0000
so ya we go back a bit üôÇ


[16-May-24 07:44 PM] evany.#0000
oh LHP is so cheap i have to put one on


[16-May-24 07:44 PM] evany.#0000
what else is worth it. be careful i don't have much bank!


[16-May-24 07:45 PM] jvaler#0000
really that's about it


[16-May-24 07:46 PM] evany.#0000
hyper power reactor sounds faster.. 3parsec/h to 30 parsec/h


[16-May-24 07:47 PM] jvaler#0000
HYR are prohibitively expensive for questionable returns in speed


[16-May-24 07:47 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't know the actual math for reactors but you can test flight times CX <-> CX with the test button in `BLU`


[16-May-24 07:48 PM] jvaler#0000
those long flights are where they make the most difference afaik


[16-May-24 07:48 PM] evany.#0000
BNAHAHAHA


[16-May-24 07:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'm also upgrading rn and just getting WCB and LHP. Maybe you could use a bigger FTL tank but it's not necessary even for CX to CX trips


[16-May-24 07:51 PM] jvaler#0000
they're getting one with an LFL and MSL


[16-May-24 07:53 PM] evany.#0000
honestly its actually a lot faster. 38hours to 19 hours.. so its a ton ton faster.


but mate look at that fuel consumption wowY

[16-May-24 07:53 PM] evany.#0000
3x the fuel


[16-May-24 07:54 PM] jvaler#0000
yk i've found that BGS are actually somewhat useful in upgraded starter WCBs because they don't have an underpowered FSE(fuel saving engine)

BGS have no effect if the engine isn't strong enough for max acceleration to become a bottleneck, and FSE don't have enough acceleration on a WCB to hit that, but a starter engine does.

i'd save that upgrade for later when you get a faction contract paying you to upgrade a ship though. the BGS is so small it doesn't hit any volume thresholds to require more emitters or hull plating so you can add it anytime


[16-May-24 07:54 PM] jvaler#0000
oh christ i'd never run that much fuel lmao

maybe that's why i didn't see much benefits in testing


[16-May-24 07:55 PM] evany.#0000
i mean fair


[16-May-24 07:55 PM] evany.#0000
its almost certainly out of my budget anyway

but since i had it open ill share the knowledge

üòå 

[16-May-24 07:55 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah you wanna keep the starter reactor and engine cause they're perfectly good


[16-May-24 07:56 PM] evany.#0000
thats 17.3k aic in FTL alone  for a one way trip

[16-May-24 07:57 PM] .shiva.#0000
So the FSE is only really worth for a new construction?


[16-May-24 07:57 PM] evany.#0000
i wonder if theres _ANY_ one doing that and making a profit. i feel like its easier to scale on the macro side with bigger buffers than ever worry about speed like that


[16-May-24 07:58 PM] evany.#0000
i'd say yes


[16-May-24 07:58 PM] jvaler#0000
correct


[16-May-24 07:58 PM] evany.#0000
if your gonna be putting that 700k down anyway.. sure why not spend 20k more and halve fuel


[16-May-24 07:59 PM] evany.#0000
infact had i known your starter ships were 'worth' that much early game


[16-May-24 07:59 PM] evany.#0000
i probably would have deconstructed it to sell the components to fund my early game


[16-May-24 07:59 PM] jvaler#0000
you can't deconstruct ships :P

but i want you to know i too looked at the LHP and thought hell yeah


[16-May-24 08:05 PM] evany.#0000
so i bought one of each off the market for my two ships - for one day


[16-May-24 08:05 PM] evany.#0000
and rebuilt anew blueprint to shove it into the project


[16-May-24 08:05 PM] evany.#0000

Maybe just a bad day and then we happened to start at the same time


[16-May-24 10:12 PM] avalock#0000
tbh my thesis was: ‚ÄúEPA regulations, and geopolitical moves towards EVs, as well as geopolitical situations for lithium mining seems undervalued and will most likely increase over the next 4-8 years‚Äù and so far i‚Äôm right which is :Despairge:


[16-May-24 10:13 PM] avalock#0000
but i guess at some point you gotta stop yoloing options :PepeLa:


[16-May-24 10:15 PM] .shiva.#0000
to me it looks like the market happened to run dry / bought out (the 1k sale), and then people raised the price in the newly open market

the actual volume isn't really any different when you look back over the last several months


[16-May-24 10:17 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The 1000/u spike is even before the second to last volume column


[16-May-24 10:17 PM] .shiva.#0000
volume has gone up a ~bit~ over time, could've also just reached a tipping point

ah nice, didn't notice Prunplanner had that. Was wondering about the supply over time, but no way to see that in game (I'm pretty sure?)

[16-May-24 10:22 PM] jvaler#0000
not really no. cause traded could be supply or demand, it's just any transaction


[16-May-24 10:23 PM] .shiva.#0000
yeah


[16-May-24 10:28 PM] avalock#0000
honestly i wish there was more than a SMA(10) indicator


[16-May-24 10:28 PM] avalock#0000
an SMA(20) would be nice

[16-May-24 11:00 PM] avalock#0000
wait i just realized, you should shrink the data from 07/01/2022-07/01/2023


[16-May-24 11:02 PM] jvaler#0000
what for?


[16-May-24 11:04 PM] avalock#0000
cause looking for things with so much information can muddy things


[16-May-24 11:08 PM] avalock#0000
the chart before and after october 2023 have weird ranges in some cases in the volume and S/D side


[16-May-24 11:11 PM] avalock#0000
i mostly arbitrarily picked a 1 year as really any slice would be fine (1 month, 3 month, 5 month etc)


[16-May-24 11:13 PM] avalock#0000
except maybe +1 year


[16-May-24 11:24 PM] jvaler#0000
sometimes. depends on your goal though right? i wanted to compare it to current day so the range makes sense


[16-May-24 11:28 PM] avalock#0000
yeah


[16-May-24 11:29 PM] jvaler#0000
sorry i don't really know anything about markets or how to analyze them lmao üò≠


[16-May-24 11:31 PM] avalock#0000
:giggle: its more how you phrased your answer that i came up with mine


[16-May-24 11:33 PM] avalock#0000
if it didn‚Äôt include the ‚Äúsometimes. depends on your goal though right‚Äù then we look at the second part only, and its more like the wide picture is good right, you get the big picture


[16-May-24 11:33 PM] avalock#0000
but if you want the more detailed picture you slice between that


[16-May-24 11:34 PM] avalock#0000
uh say like for natural gas


[16-May-24 11:35 PM] avalock#0000
nat gas around the winter goes zoomies


[16-May-24 11:36 PM] avalock#0000
it‚Äôs all determined on how much was extracted during the summer months, reserves not including federal, how much was used during the summer months and stuff (supply)


[16-May-24 11:37 PM] avalock#0000
and if you get detailed views of the winter with that information (which is publically available) you can speculate on the demand for the season typically :hehe:


[16-May-24 11:37 PM] avalock#0000
so detailed slices are p good


[16-May-24 11:38 PM] avalock#0000
but the first part made the question too subjective for me to really answer because it would be true


[16-May-24 11:38 PM] avalock#0000
not that there needs to be an objective answer


[16-May-24 11:40 PM] avalock#0000
:giggle: i hope this makes sense


[16-May-24 11:40 PM] avalock#0000
i would draw pictures but i‚Äôm on mobile


[16-May-24 11:45 PM] jvaler#0000

yeah, I might be missing the point

[18-May-24 04:47 AM] nyanism#0000
The cost also increase like a lot tho,
cus you burn additional GRN, its faster to produce C in larger quantities, but actually more expensive in material cost, sure it does save you those consumable for Pioneers, just make sure you did the number right


[18-May-24 04:49 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Was looking at life maybe to start another farm?


[18-May-24 04:50 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
Yeah, I just need to look at starting another farm. I‚Äôm more interested in C output, not too fussed about consumables or profit


[18-May-24 04:52 AM] nyanism#0000
Dem profitable part also let you decide if it actually worth the effort running 3 bases to get those C, or buy em

[18-May-24 06:10 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i had 6 PPF making PSL but i realised it's not worth selling, i'll make them to stockpile for making new bases and helping noobs, but NL and LFabs is where it's at


[18-May-24 06:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Sometimes I feel like I make too many LFABs tho....


[18-May-24 06:12 PM] uncle_leslie69#0000
depends what you do with them tho, i need to make to sell, so i can get another ship tbh, 2 is killing me rn


[18-May-24 06:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
true and I think LDE is the best one out of the bunch

‚ù§Ô∏è 

[19-May-24 01:10 AM] akyantor#0000
I was thinking of making fabs, but feels like a lot of people already do that. Is that because its effectively a more expensive consumable (repairs of buildings as well as people expanding)?


[19-May-24 01:11 AM] akyantor#0000
I wonder if it makes more sense to jump to just making some of the more expensive ones that use the EPO I'm already making, and skip trying to make bfabs


[19-May-24 01:12 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess the market is thinner for rfab/afabs


[19-May-24 01:12 AM] .urpalhal#0000
there is a pretty niche demand for rfabs on Malahat


[19-May-24 01:13 AM] akyantor#0000
I doudt I'd be making massive quantities regardless of the type for any time


[19-May-24 01:14 AM] akyantor#0000
Just doing some research into traded vol, to see what would make sense.


[19-May-24 01:16 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm a little off making a decision anyway. I have a little more space to use on Griffonstone, and a lot more space to fill on Harmonia. So will want to make good use of that space first.


[19-May-24 01:17 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You could look into manufacturing


[19-May-24 01:20 AM] akyantor#0000
I did look at that as well, but doesn't marry up quite as well with EPO. That said, easy to flip the POL plants to something different.


[19-May-24 01:20 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Well you could make OFF with a BMP


[19-May-24 01:21 AM] akyantor#0000
True, just saw that one


[19-May-24 01:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
And then you could add PG? And make a lot with that


[19-May-24 01:23 AM] .urpalhal#0000
OVE, PWO


[19-May-24 01:23 AM] akyantor#0000
PE woud be a good match with the oversupply I will have of C


[19-May-24 01:23 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Add WPL and you could make NL and COT


[19-May-24 01:27 AM] .urpalhal#0000
For cotton you could add RCO to your Harmonia farms


[19-May-24 01:27 AM] .urpalhal#0000
So many options


[19-May-24 01:27 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, this is the challenge. I was just thinking on going on all in C for Harmonia, but might be better to split it


[19-May-24 01:28 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Throw it into PrUn Planner


[19-May-24 01:28 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Play around with some different set ups


[19-May-24 01:28 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You shouldn‚Äôt need too much RCO per day


[19-May-24 01:29 AM] akyantor#0000
My current plan doesn't fully utilise the space on Harmonia, so may be an option

{Reactions}
‚ù§Ô∏è 

[19-May-24 01:32 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm starting to think that extracting my own water on Harmonia isn't the best use of space üôÇ


[19-May-24 01:35 AM] akyantor#0000
That and it won't make sensed to keep the CLR on there for much longer either. Maybe the first step is to get the CLR onto an electronics planet.


[19-May-24 01:37 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah just buy it


[19-May-24 11:07 AM] akyantor#0000
If I were in the market for a third planet to do some manufacturing would it be bonkers to go to QJ-382a, where I can both do some manufacturing and get some MG for my Chemistry base in Griffonstone? It's high pressure, so would have an additional build cost. Do repairs later also include repairing the additional material to deal with the pressure?


[19-May-24 11:08 AM] tanda#0000
yes, you have to use the additional materials in repairs


[19-May-24 11:09 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, so I'd need to consider the downsides


[19-May-24 11:09 AM] tanda#0000
like on Nike you need SEA to repair your buildings


[19-May-24 11:09 AM] tanda#0000
PRUNplanner actually takes into account building degradation separately now


[19-May-24 11:09 AM] tanda#0000
so do a couple different plans


[19-May-24 11:10 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I'll need to factor in that as a downside vs the cost of two planets for the same purpose


[19-May-24 11:12 AM] akyantor#0000
That said, doesn't look like there are many planets with no downsides that also have a decent supply of MGS, so maybe just have to take the hiut


[19-May-24 11:12 AM] nyanism#0000
You already have hephateus?


[19-May-24 11:12 AM] akyantor#0000

[19-May-24 11:13 AM] nyanism#0000
Hep would be much less logistical nightmare and relatively simple to settle, cus its normal planet an right next to the CX, unless you want most of the output to go to griffonstone, chance are at full capacity, you will have a lot of overflow


[19-May-24 11:14 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's the alternative, and have to buy the MG


[19-May-24 11:14 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
depends how much you need, i manufacture an ass load of it


[19-May-24 11:15 AM] tanda#0000
honestly unless you plan on hauling around MGS, you're probably best off just buying MG

there's a reason I stepped up a base on Elon for MG supply there


[19-May-24 11:15 AM] akyantor#0000
I'd probably process the MGS on QJ-382a, and then transport the MG to Griffonstone.


[19-May-24 11:16 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
what are your plans with the MG anyway?


[19-May-24 11:16 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess it'd be to give me the option to make PG, which could then be fed into various manufacturing or fab products at some point in the future (likely sold in the short term).


[19-May-24 11:17 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
ahh fair, is it griff you're wanting to do chem on?


[19-May-24 11:17 AM] akyantor#0000
Looks like MG is the cheaper of the ingredients anyway for PG, so maybe an unnecessary complication...


[19-May-24 11:17 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, I'm already doing EPO on griffonstone


[19-May-24 11:18 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
ahh fair enough, well i sell MG at 35/u, not sure what CX is


[19-May-24 11:19 AM] nyanism#0000
If you have a reliable source of MG supply, it might be easier to skip the production and make sth more profitable with the capital you have


[19-May-24 11:19 AM] nyanism#0000
CX should be 70-80


[19-May-24 11:19 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
oof


[19-May-24 11:19 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm tempted to make my life simpler and just do manufacturing on hephateus, and buy the MG

well should you go that path, all my MG is made on Heph so no shipping for you üòé

Yeah, I'm making my own Carbon on Harmonia

[19-May-24 11:20 AM] akyantor#0000
Otherwise the whole thing would probably be bust :S


[19-May-24 11:20 AM] akyantor#0000
That was my starter planet


[19-May-24 11:20 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i grow my HCP on Harmonia and make C on 759g


[19-May-24 11:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Interesting


[19-May-24 11:23 AM] akyantor#0000
For some reason I incorrectly thought that INC was aligned to the aggriculture category


[19-May-24 11:23 AM] akyantor#0000
But it's not


[19-May-24 11:23 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
i started off growing and smelting C on Harmonia but i then decided i wanted more FRM and then moved my INC to 759g


[19-May-24 11:23 AM] uncle_leslie69#0000
yeah, resource extract


[19-May-24 11:23 AM] akyantor#0000
I should probably consider splitting that first then before messing about with the manufacturing


[19-May-24 11:24 AM] akyantor#0000
As that's kind of a backbone of the other plans anyway


[19-May-24 11:25 AM] akyantor#0000
So many options üôÇ


[19-May-24 11:26 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, I could get some H from 759g too which might be nice

Thanks.


[19-May-24 11:29 AM] akyantor#0000
I've a fairly clear idea of what I want to do on Griffonstone, but this conversation has definitely changed what I'll do on Harmonia now that I've realised my error about the CoGC for INC


[19-May-24 11:29 AM] akyantor#0000
I was going to build more on Harmonia, but that doesn't make a lot of sense longer term


[19-May-24 11:57 AM] akyantor#0000
Ok, so new plan is to make what I'm already making more scalable, then look at manufacturing. That means moving my CLR to Phobos, and then eventually moving my INC to 759g.


[19-May-24 11:58 AM] akyantor#0000
That'll give me space to grow into when I need it, and align everything with the CoGC.


[19-May-24 11:58 AM] akyantor#0000
After that I can think about something new.

1. I don't like much of trade being locked behind a mechanic free players can't access. 
2. It's also a self-perpetuating cycle of stuff not being available on CX, so people make stuff in-corp, so it's not available on the CX. 
3. I can't know for sure but I think that it would be more fun if that internal trade came to the CX, where people can mess with each other and so higher-tier production is possible for more players

How many days worth of supplies do folks normally shoot for holding at each base? I've been resupplying every 4-5 days at the moment, which feels like a lot of thrashing about. Thinking of shifting to 14 days minimum, so I just do a big run every two weeks.


[20-May-24 12:07 PM] jvaler#0000
harmonia doesn't have a lot of exports, so if you increase the consumable buffer there you can minimize how much you need to send your ships by maximizing the cargo bay usage on the export trip


[20-May-24 12:07 PM] jvaler#0000
14d sounds like a good goal


[20-May-24 12:08 PM] akyantor#0000
I'm buying enough to keep them going for 14 days based upon a stock take yesterday at the moment. I think once I've done that I'll feel more comfortable taking a week or so to focus on using any funds for expansion, before flipping back to resupply


[20-May-24 12:12 PM] sidepipe#0000
I typically shoot for 20 days and resupply 10 days at a time - it makes the math easier

[20-May-24 12:13 PM] realharvey#0000
When I started out, I've never really stocked up un consumable supplies. Now since I am starting to grow bigger, I keep bigger piles of consumables because it gets very annoying buying 10 consumables for bases + the Inputs


[20-May-24 12:14 PM] akyantor#0000
I guess I don't want to extend them too long as will make more sense earlier on the use captial for expansion, but also annoying for it to be too short and risk a production slowdown because you miss something.


[20-May-24 12:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, 14 days seems reasonable at this point üôÇ


[20-May-24 12:15 PM] realharvey#0000
depending on how many bases you have 14 might even be quite alot. At the start you dont have alot of cashflow. If you need the next supplies you are forced to use buy orders instead of sell orders and leave some cash on the table for that


[20-May-24 12:21 PM] akyantor#0000
I've only two at the moment, so not to complicated too manage.

maybe end of next month i want to start building C bases


[20-May-24 09:45 PM] evany.#0000
its just stupid money since i started and when i asked about it i was kind of told to lean away from it


[20-May-24 09:45 PM] evany.#0000
but i did the math earlier today and the cost per unit to make C is 353~469 depending on recipes


[20-May-24 09:46 PM] evany.#0000
even at 600 its still 40% returns


[20-May-24 09:46 PM] evany.#0000
todays prices are insane profit!

I scanned for best buildings recently and INC has got the best profits out of everything else available rn


[20-May-24 09:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I was also thinking of starting a base


[20-May-24 09:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
but I'm worried it won't last this high and then I will be stuck with a base only able to make 1 commodity


[20-May-24 09:48 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I still think it won't go down as far as C used to be


[20-May-24 09:49 PM] evany.#0000
if you look at carbon and its ingredients pretty closely... theres a few people manipulating the price of it pretty heavily


[20-May-24 09:49 PM] evany.#0000
youll see a few names both as the big buys and big sells kind of price fixing it to keep it here


[20-May-24 09:49 PM] evany.#0000

[21-May-24 08:18 AM] acramernc#0000
very true, but if he needs it on elon, and i make it on elon, it still saves both of us a trip


[21-May-24 08:43 AM] jvaler#0000
not really though? cause if you're sending a ship to import PG ingredients that ship still has to go back to ANT anyways


[21-May-24 08:44 AM] jvaler#0000
the return trip happens whether you take PG or not


[21-May-24 09:19 AM] acramernc#0000
fair enough, although my monkey brain still likes not having to load it onto a ship

or how does the game determine your HQ bonus at all? Was it even implemented?

[22-May-24 11:17 AM] nyanism#0000
Oki, good to know its actually implemented, now to the next question, how can i know which planet give what bonus?
say i know deimos and hep has Electronics as HQ bonus, how can one determine where to get other kind of bonus? Like if i want Manufacturing or Metallurgy, where should i go?


[22-May-24 11:18 AM] flor2081#0000
ahh, the CoGC bonus?


[22-May-24 11:18 AM] nyanism#0000
Not CoGC, the Company HQ bonus


[22-May-24 11:18 AM] nyanism#0000
Its based on HQ location and level correct?


[22-May-24 11:18 AM] nyanism#0000
^


[22-May-24 11:18 AM] flor2081#0000
yes, but it gives that everywhere


[22-May-24 11:19 AM] flor2081#0000
so for me, every building with the category Agriculture has that 6.9% boost


[22-May-24 11:19 AM] flor2081#0000
like everywhere


[22-May-24 11:19 AM] nyanism#0000
Yes, that part I understand


[22-May-24 11:19 AM] flor2081#0000
the location only changes the type of bonus you get


[22-May-24 11:19 AM] flor2081#0000
so if you move to moria, you get bonus in construction (i think?) instead of agri / food processing


[22-May-24 11:19 AM] nyanism#0000
Yes, this is what im asking for, how can i tell ‚Äúwhere‚Äù do i have to relocate, to get the right bonus im looking for


[22-May-24 11:20 AM] flor2081#0000
aaaah


[22-May-24 11:20 AM] nyanism#0000
If im not 30 permit empire, this bonus actually is sth i think can benefit smaller player like myself greatly,


[22-May-24 11:20 AM] flor2081#0000
I get it now üòÑ

it might not really be worth the hassle though, if you're mainly based in antares then building a base in moria just for the construction/metallurgy boost is a bit much


[22-May-24 11:23 AM] nyanism#0000
That‚Äôs understandable, but i believe ill figure out how to benefit from it at some point lol,  thanks for pointing me to the right direction, that pretty much nail it

[27-May-24 01:54 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Any reason you do the ask over the avg for pricing?


[27-May-24 02:01 AM] akyantor#0000
I've generally used the bid price for anything I'm selling, and the ask price for anything I'm buying. I may do better, but early on it seems that's the safest way to ensure I don't end up underwater when judging margins. *That may be a bit conservative for when you've got up and running with a better cash buffer.*


[27-May-24 02:11 AM] akyantor#0000
Would be interested to know why you'd use ask for both buy and sell too.

I‚Äôm surprised the price is high when superficially the number of people bidding is quite low compared to the number of offers to sell.


[29-May-24 09:22 AM] akyantor#0000
I guess there‚Äôs a lot of folks buying immediately at the offer price.


[29-May-24 09:23 AM] jvaler#0000
bids don't reflect the state of markets imo because they're immaterial, you can just put up money (which isn't too hard to come by)
but asks require actual materials to be listed, so they're tangible


[29-May-24 09:24 AM] akyantor#0000
Very true


[29-May-24 09:24 AM] .urpalhal#0000

some of those guys play at such a different level it feels like we aren't playing the same game tbh


[29-May-24 08:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
every time xensored shares some details of his plans and operations developing the Arclight region I'm pretty blown away. Like, I'm not huge, but I'm pretty much to what I'd consider "late game", where money comes easy and the challenge is figuring out how to make it work for you. But even if I played this game as a full time job I don't think I could come close to pulling off the complex stuff that they're doing. I kinda like this game for that though. I also know older players who have a single base and that's all they want. When everything is so player-driven there's just a lot of ways to define your own success


[29-May-24 08:20 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm at like 14 bases and it's almost too much for me to want to manage. Carcissia used to manage 31 bases building entire ships *and* all the consumables and fuel for himself. I can't even imagine...


[29-May-24 08:21 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'll stick to my PE and slow takover of Benten


[29-May-24 08:21 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
(this is a joke, taking over Benten sounds like *way* too much work)

i keep telling myself i'll make that resupply manager spreadsheet eventually but...


[29-May-24 08:32 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
üòÜ we were literally just talking about that in the KAWA server, lol. I had so many plans but haven't made progress in months. AriesNation keeps talking about a fancy one with some code to make it more efficient, but I think I might just finish a rough draft of mine


[29-May-24 08:34 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I just want something that acts like a burn tracker, but I can also override specific materials with specific thresholds that I want to keep, like fuel reserves. Also factor in POPI and CoGC upkeep for the planets I manage.


[29-May-24 08:34 PM] evany.#0000
is there an api ?


[29-May-24 08:34 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
kind of? it's a player made API that scrapes data from your browser when the game is open using an extension


[29-May-24 08:34 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
then you can get *that* data


[29-May-24 08:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000

[29-May-24 08:37 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
no problem. I don't have a ton of technical skills, I started playing this game partially to learn spreadsheets better üòÜ (it worked), but I love seeing all the tools that other people come up with


[29-May-24 08:54 PM] jvaler#0000
my ideal one is one that automatically tells me how much of everything i need to bring to add +10, 20, 30, etc. days to my burns. and i want it to have a step factor so that if i have a recipe that uses 6 of something at a time it will only tell me to bring it in sets of 6


[29-May-24 09:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôve been wanting something like that myself - I usually resupply in 10 day increments, but there are things that get out of sync as you do that. Especially bases that take two trips


[29-May-24 09:18 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
nice. If I had the time I'd set mine up so that I could configure my shipping routes and it just tell me what to load and unload at each stop... I've kind of used PMMG custom inventory sorting as a temporary fix but it's far from perfect


[29-May-24 09:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000

I think that a spreadsheet will only scale so far (especially on google sheets). building this tool with a web app would be so much better


[29-May-24 09:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
True


[29-May-24 09:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
My skills are really good in the sheets tho‚Ä¶. Not so much not in the sheets


[29-May-24 09:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
same... I'd love to finish school for CS but I can't afford it. I've learned spreadsheets pretty well, but specifically gsheets, and that can't handle nearly as much as excel


[29-May-24 09:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm thinking the compromise is trying to make things more efficient using apps script functions


[29-May-24 09:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
which are fairly easy to learn using GPT


[29-May-24 09:25 PM] lossi#0000
"And that can't handle nearly as much as excel"


[29-May-24 09:26 PM] lossi#0000
In my experience that's quite untrue


[29-May-24 09:26 PM] lossi#0000
I can make some very magical sheets in gsheets that I can't in excel


[29-May-24 09:26 PM] .urpalhal#0000
For my data analysis I‚Äôve been using origin instead of excel bc excel crashes with 100k lines of things


[29-May-24 09:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that google sheets can't handle as much data as excel?


[29-May-24 09:26 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I mean yeah, I still absolutely love g sheets


[29-May-24 09:26 PM] lossi#0000
data, I'm not sure


[29-May-24 09:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it can do some cool stuff and has some *amazing* QoL wins over excel


[29-May-24 09:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I still use sheets for a reason


[29-May-24 09:27 PM] lossi#0000
But if you're doing something that requires enough data that you break gsheets


[29-May-24 09:27 PM] lossi#0000
maybe you shouldn't be using a spreadsheet app to begin with

[29-May-24 09:27 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
but I just don't know if it can handle the ideas I have or if I should just scale down

Origin does pretty good


[29-May-24 09:28 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I mean yeah, that's exactly the problem, lol


[29-May-24 09:28 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
it's definitely not the tool for the job but it's the tool I know

[29-May-24 09:35 PM] sidepipe#0000
I do spreadsheets for a living so I‚Äôd probably stick with gsheets for most things. The appscript stuff is pretty nice for grabbing other stuff from FIO and dumping it into a sheet format too, which you‚Äôd probably need to do for something like this


[29-May-24 09:36 PM] sidepipe#0000
But there is a little, tiny part of me that wants to make the most convoluted shiny app in R for this instead üòÑ


[29-May-24 09:39 PM] sidepipe#0000
The basic burn stuff should be easy enough in any case. I was thinking about the route planning as well - I think you could make it work in a sheet if you just had some predefined routes (like ANT -> Harmonia -> Norwick)


[29-May-24 09:39 PM] evany.#0000
i can't think of a way you'd do route optimizaation in excel very well though


[29-May-24 09:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
You‚Äôd definitely have to set those in advance. Route optimization in general is probably complex enough that you wouldn‚Äôt want to do it often


[29-May-24 09:41 PM] sidepipe#0000
But if you had approximate flight times and import / export volumes, that might get you close


[29-May-24 09:41 PM] .shiva.#0000
You *could* make the solver do it


[29-May-24 09:42 PM] .shiva.#0000
Would you want to? No


[29-May-24 09:42 PM] sidepipe#0000
But that‚Äôs the fun in it üòÑ


[29-May-24 09:43 PM] evany.#0000
i mean consumption is mostly static 
if you mapped out the delta's from origin between each station/planet it wouldn't be too complicated to solve for, the problem is at that optimization level though your now scheduling alarms for 4am to set your ship which gets into murky territory probably


[29-May-24 09:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
Yep, and if you have to do that you should buy another ship instead üòÑ


[29-May-24 09:44 PM] evany.#0000
yeah


[29-May-24 09:44 PM] evany.#0000
thats probably fair !


[29-May-24 09:45 PM] sidepipe#0000
I might play around with the burn / load planning stuff this weekend - I‚Äôll share anything useful I come up with üôÇ

{Reactions}

[29-May-24 09:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
The route optimization idea seems really interesting as something to do once every time you change a base. Not minimizing time, but trips. I find the in game map really hard to read, so most of my flights just end up being to and from ANT


[29-May-24 09:47 PM] evany.#0000
thats a really good point; i think the same. for the odd 1hour i might save going between planets it seems never worth it


[29-May-24 09:48 PM] evany.#0000
admittedly i only have 3 planets so fuck me for having an opinion- but how can all 3 of my planets be 6hours from CX but 14hours from each other


[29-May-24 09:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
üëÜ


[29-May-24 09:48 PM] sidepipe#0000
But only the second part of that sentence üòÑ


[29-May-24 09:49 PM] evany.#0000
definitely questionable physics!


[29-May-24 09:49 PM] .shiva.#0000
In system burn time feels like it makes a lot of planet to planet logistics just not worth?


[29-May-24 09:49 PM] .shiva.#0000
In theory the "planned" space elevators might change that eventually I guess?


[29-May-24 09:54 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm still not 100% sure what the space elevators will do honestly


[29-May-24 09:55 PM] .shiva.#0000
I was assuming they'd be kinda like the CX, how you don't need to spend a ton of fuel to land / launch


[29-May-24 09:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
Landing on a planet seems so minor in the context of all the stuff ships do


[29-May-24 09:56 PM] lossi#0000
It's the vast majority of your STL fuel consumption for such a small distance


[29-May-24 09:57 PM] lossi#0000
For small ships and at a small scale, it doesn't matter too much


[29-May-24 09:57 PM] lossi#0000
but when you're pinching pennies with a dozen or so massive ships


[29-May-24 09:57 PM] lossi#0000
it can make a difference


[29-May-24 09:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
I never took the time to look at anything other than the total fuel consumption tbh. That makes a lot more sense


[29-May-24 10:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
A flat % off would add up to quite a lot over time


[29-May-24 10:05 PM] .shiva.#0000
Part of it as well is that FTL and STL fuel are basically the same price. Adding an extra jump doesn't even come close to the amount of STL fuel you'll spend to land


[29-May-24 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
That's my normal wake up time


[30-May-24 01:40 AM] .urpalhal#0000

[02-Jun-24 04:56 PM] evany.#0000
if thats the case its better for me to let them sit idle until the pop takes over


[02-Jun-24 04:57 PM] tanda#0000
unfortunately, the buildings will always degrade, whether being used or not. HAving them doing something is always better


[02-Jun-24 04:57 PM] flor2081#0000
best to build 1 day before the popr


[02-Jun-24 04:58 PM] evany.#0000
right but if their job is 22hours; it will be 22hours * 10 = 10 days away
so they will never complete a single build before popr


[02-Jun-24 04:58 PM] evany.#0000
and then i'd wait 10 more days for them to finish first one- then population change should effect %'s and they should go full speed ahead

if you want proximity there's YK-024a that takes HSE
if you want proximity+triple green there's electronica

you could definitely do that. You'll need help with shipping, but that triple permit INC base can definitely scale up


[02-Jun-24 07:30 PM] tanda#0000
wouldn't want to run 66 INC any higher than double burn, personally


[02-Jun-24 07:35 PM] evany.#0000
thats actually why we went GRN


[02-Jun-24 07:35 PM] evany.#0000
rather than HCP


[02-Jun-24 07:36 PM] evany.#0000
if it was 4 GRN 2 HCP - fine, but 2GRN 4 HCP worried about stocks and maintenance


[02-Jun-24 07:37 PM] evany.#0000
might have to look into HCP - it definitely makes more sense!


[02-Jun-24 07:37 PM] evany.#0000
any excelperts in here


[02-Jun-24 07:39 PM] jvaler#0000
right that's the correct call


[02-Jun-24 07:39 PM] jvaler#0000
some HCP for the double input recipe can be good to reduce the number of INC needed, but you want to keep the HCP needed to a minimum


[02-Jun-24 07:40 PM] evany.#0000
plus its fine. i upgraded hq 7 lvl's for only half a mil so i still have 4 more permits before ill probably have to set aside a few mil - obviously not every base should be triple its not really a good use of permit(s)


[02-Jun-24 07:41 PM] tanda#0000
to support a 66 INC base, you would need 5 farms running 2:1 GRN/HCP


[02-Jun-24 07:41 PM] evany.#0000
yeah only have 3 running GRN right now


[02-Jun-24 07:41 PM] jvaler#0000
so don't :P
you can use the triple input recipe too


[02-Jun-24 07:42 PM] jvaler#0000
475 area of INC should be able to eat up loads of agri if you don't limit yourself to the single input recipe


[02-Jun-24 07:43 PM] evany.#0000
Definitely not going to!


[02-Jun-24 07:45 PM] tanda#0000
I think doing all green is cost efficient, you just should look into doing INC somewhere else in addition to Nascent

For market exchange yes, for cost to produce I mean


[02-Jun-24 08:21 PM] evany.#0000
The triple method from my numbers just pulling subcomponents off cx makes c base cost like 620/unit


[02-Jun-24 08:21 PM] jvaler#0000
it costs more, but you run the recipe faster


[02-Jun-24 08:21 PM] tanda#0000
if you actually tried to pull mats off the CX, you would run out of mats


[02-Jun-24 08:22 PM] evany.#0000
It‚Äôs true that it just shits out carbon like 3z the rate


[02-Jun-24 08:22 PM] evany.#0000
But if c goes back to ~600 your operating at a loss suddenly


[02-Jun-24 08:22 PM] jvaler#0000
and if you grew the inputs yourself and tried to sell them raw on the CX, it'd crash the agri market.
so the triple recipe certainly has it's place imo. especially with a HYF base pumping out HCP


[02-Jun-24 08:23 PM] evany.#0000
That‚Äôs why the market seems not functioning in some ways


[02-Jun-24 08:23 PM] evany.#0000
It‚Äôs very‚Ä¶. Fragile


[02-Jun-24 08:24 PM] evany.#0000
I have a sneaking suspicion that most people think mats they make are free


[02-Jun-24 08:24 PM] jvaler#0000
that's cause 600/u for C is/was too low. even the efficient single input GRN recipe gave mediocre profits


[02-Jun-24 08:25 PM] evany.#0000
I‚Äôm not home right now, but at 800/u the triple makes 30k/day more than straight grn


[02-Jun-24 08:25 PM] evany.#0000
But when price drops to 700/u the grn way makes 10k/d more


[02-Jun-24 08:26 PM] evany.#0000
So veeery delicate

The prunplanner numbers are nice but always seem a bit off to me.


[02-Jun-24 08:29 PM] jvaler#0000
i think i miscalculated my old INC evaluations, agri at 240/u and C at 600/u puts all the recipes equally profitable, and a good amount so

did some CX nonsense happen that jacked up the reported price of agri?


[02-Jun-24 08:35 PM] tanda#0000
dunno, but I can say that cost to me GRN only costs like 80/unit

[02-Jun-24 08:35 PM] tanda#0000
make it 90/unit for fuel costs

oh my god it was


[02-Jun-24 08:38 PM] jvaler#0000
that explains everything


[02-Jun-24 08:38 PM] jvaler#0000
i've been wrong this whole time, 600/u C *is* correct


[02-Jun-24 08:44 PM] evany.#0000
What was grn?


[02-Jun-24 08:44 PM] jvaler#0000
350/u üò≠

[02-Jun-24 09:31 PM] evany.#0000
I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs bad math because your basically claiming that h20 -> grn is free


[02-Jun-24 09:31 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh I do get H20 at 40/u


[02-Jun-24 09:32 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so that is good math


[02-Jun-24 09:32 PM] tanda#0000
due to not having my own supply of H2O, I get GRN at 90


[02-Jun-24 09:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ok time to ISA it up


[02-Jun-24 10:00 PM] evany.#0000
thats my point though. let me change that for a second

if we had an agreement for you to make me GRN at 40/unit and i turned it into carbon - would you be happy with that?


[02-Jun-24 10:04 PM] evany.#0000
i know it gets kind of ~meta~ conversation but no single base should be operating at a loss, your still paying yourself  - even at 200$/unit a 13 frm base is only profiting 44k/day (according to prunplanner), so the least you could do is pay your frm base 200$/unit which makes your grn far more than 20-40$


[02-Jun-24 10:04 PM] evany.#0000
only way you'd wanna say your grn base is operating at a loss is if the space irs are showing up to do an audit üòõ


[02-Jun-24 10:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well I'm saying that it costs me 20 per GRN or HCP and I still make money on that, granted nothing crazy but its not a loss


[02-Jun-24 10:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
bc it costs ~70 to make 4 units of GRN and HCP


[02-Jun-24 10:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so that cost is 17.5/u of GRN and HCP so saying it costs 20/u at nascent isn't a loss to my understanding


[02-Jun-24 10:14 PM] evany.#0000
yeah thats true and your right to say thats your cost but its not really including opportunity cost, 15k/day in consumables for pop, logistic costs repairs and ultimately the opportunity with permit. i'd actually be curious if theres any people that have scaled to the point where what do they value their permit cost at per day i wonder
i.e like 50k/day ? a week? that sort of thing


[02-Jun-24 10:24 PM] .urpalhal#0000
well even @ CX prices I believe I'd only make 25k a day


[02-Jun-24 10:24 PM] evany.#0000
prunplanner tells me 13frm grn makes 44k/day profit selling grn @ 270/unit


[02-Jun-24 10:25 PM] evany.#0000
i don't really trust those numbers.. grn is more realistically around 200-ish

for sure- i'm not giving anyone trouble about it either - play how you wanna play and all that

as long as your having fun who the hell am i to say otherwise üôÇ

oh and i have 13 farms not 14

I  play to mine HAL üôÇ


[02-Jun-24 10:42 PM] evany.#0000
thats the challenge with the carbon hcp/frm and hcp/frm/mai 
theres a ton of issues with this number before i share it just for some to consider: 
it lacks any sort of logistics, repairs, time - it just takes into cost of materials -> into C assuming you have to buy from CX (and could buy from CX in sufficient amounts)

but just strictly value wise the triple makes almost no sense unless your devaluing your GRN/HCP and especially MAI  to 'base cost'

Thanks everyone for the feedback - though!


[02-Jun-24 10:46 PM] evany.#0000
the HCP/GRN looks much better numberwise. if we can sustain the HCP


[02-Jun-24 10:48 PM] .urpalhal#0000
anywho IDK how to price things interally yk


[02-Jun-24 10:50 PM] evany.#0000
i dunno if you have ever played eve


[02-Jun-24 10:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol nope


[02-Jun-24 10:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i was told to not


[02-Jun-24 10:51 PM] evany.#0000
its REALLY common in eve to see "some players" will mine for weeks and then turn minerals into a ship and sell a ship


[02-Jun-24 10:51 PM] tanda#0000
man, EVE was some super good crack


[02-Jun-24 10:51 PM] evany.#0000
and then when you look at their shit you see they turned 400mil worth of minerals into 200mil worth of ships


[02-Jun-24 10:52 PM] evany.#0000
they would have been infinitely better off just right clicking selling all their minerals


[02-Jun-24 10:52 PM] evany.#0000
but they want to say "im a ship builder" or "i make my own ships" or something


[02-Jun-24 10:53 PM] evany.#0000
but your just kinda scratching your head cuz its like man you coulda sold it and bought two ships because someone else has a proper production chain setup and do it far more efficiently than you with perfect boosts / skills etc


[02-Jun-24 10:54 PM] evany.#0000
ultimately its a game if thats your fun its kinda like 'sure bud good job' haha


[02-Jun-24 10:54 PM] evany.#0000
and i'm happy to call myself out for being that kind of dumb, i spent 6 weeks building my first titan in like 2014 turned 160billion isk worth of mineral into 130billion isk worth of titan


[02-Jun-24 10:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol


[02-Jun-24 10:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I don't think I'm doing anything crazy like that


[02-Jun-24 10:57 PM] .urpalhal#0000
bc both bases are profitable with CX prices


[02-Jun-24 10:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so basically my profits from my FRM base is just shifted into my higher value product


[02-Jun-24 10:58 PM] evany.#0000
if i had to offer some advice on this internal pricing i'd say theres no such thing as internal pricing, if you wouldn't be happy selling it at the exchange at that price than your internal cost is too low

its the same 100$ you make either way
but to say one stage made you zero dollars and the other made you 100$ is crazy
more likely one made you 40$ and the other made you 60$ y'know?


[02-Jun-24 10:58 PM] evany.#0000
you played tanda ?


[02-Jun-24 10:59 PM] evany.#0000
and yeah i definitely don't mean to say you are doing something crazy. it would be hard to do that in this game


[02-Jun-24 10:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh yeah no just a self sanity check


[02-Jun-24 11:00 PM] evany.#0000
this game is a lot more punishing in a way


[02-Jun-24 11:00 PM] .urpalhal#0000
than eve?


[02-Jun-24 11:00 PM] evany.#0000
yes


[02-Jun-24 11:01 PM] evany.#0000
in this game you'd probably notice within a few days that your holy crap losing money on a base unless you had a bunch of planets covering for it that you somehow don't notice


[02-Jun-24 11:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
oh yeah I see


[02-Jun-24 11:02 PM] evany.#0000
in eve its really easy to turn 100mil into 50mil and not notice


[02-Jun-24 11:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah that was my first base making ALO on nascent


[02-Jun-24 11:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i was very much upsidedown


[02-Jun-24 11:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
had to coliq and start over


[02-Jun-24 11:02 PM] evany.#0000
my deimos base (starter) i haven't scaled either. it still has tutorial buildings on it


[02-Jun-24 11:03 PM] evany.#0000
took me three weeks to afford a single new smelter to start using my surplus ALO then i figured out i didn't have enough pops


[02-Jun-24 11:04 PM] evany.#0000
depending on the price of carbon i was doing trips being like +3k/day barely skirting by


[02-Jun-24 11:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah I took out a loan and struggle bused it up


[02-Jun-24 11:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
somehow got my deimos base maxed out


[02-Jun-24 11:05 PM] evany.#0000
a really nice guy xflqr gave me 100k and i bought additional extractor/supply building before i stopped and was like why am i scaling this base it doesn't make me money

[02-Jun-24 11:07 PM] evany.#0000

[02-Jun-24 11:07 PM] evany.#0000
"ok cool"


[02-Jun-24 11:07 PM] evany.#0000
would not recommend right now..


[02-Jun-24 11:07 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I also read a form that said to mine ALO on nascent and was like cool


[02-Jun-24 11:08 PM] evany.#0000
i honestly would write like a 'things you should know before playing' post


[02-Jun-24 11:08 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah


[02-Jun-24 11:08 PM] evany.#0000
the problem is people wouldn't read it until they already made decisions and their only real option would be to coliq


[02-Jun-24 11:08 PM] evany.#0000
and thats assuming they got involved enough to join a discord or see a blerb about it somewhere


[02-Jun-24 11:09 PM] evany.#0000
new player retention is probably really bad


[02-Jun-24 11:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
i started the game and looked at the choices I could make and siad yeah nope


[02-Jun-24 11:09 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Imma find a tutorial


[02-Jun-24 11:09 PM] evany.#0000
i'd be lying if i said i hadn't considered throwing in the towel too
only reason i stuck around is i like a challenge and i figured i was doing something horribly wrong


[02-Jun-24 11:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I found this discord


[02-Jun-24 11:10 PM] .urpalhal#0000
else I probs would've tapped out too


[02-Jun-24 11:11 PM] evany.#0000
i felt compelled because i dragged other people into this shit with me - but honestly this place has been a saving grace in a lot of ways


[02-Jun-24 11:14 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, I wound up getting sucked into Manufacturing there too. Deeply enjoyed drone manufacture there


[02-Jun-24 11:14 PM] evany.#0000

same


[02-Jun-24 11:20 PM] evany.#0000
the biggest fleet i've probably fc'd is like 70 people or so.


[02-Jun-24 11:20 PM] tanda#0000

[02-Jun-24 11:20 PM] tanda#0000
and we kicked butt


[02-Jun-24 11:23 PM] evany.#0000
oh i have been in big ones like b-r5 with 60k people in it


[02-Jun-24 11:23 PM] evany.#0000
but its not fun at all


[02-Jun-24 11:23 PM] evany.#0000
sub 100 is where the fun is


[02-Jun-24 11:23 PM] tanda#0000
I have a friend that was involved with early BoB in their titan building phase and said the only fun thing was ripping them off


[02-Jun-24 11:24 PM] tanda#0000
so I steered clear of big time fleets there


[02-Jun-24 11:25 PM] evany.#0000
eh i think its worth having the experience but its mostly just lag and listening to someone that hasn't showered for six days


[02-Jun-24 11:26 PM] tanda#0000
well, the not showering for six days is mostly due to Time Dilation


[02-Jun-24 11:26 PM] tanda#0000
that's how long it takes to finish big fleet battles


[02-Jun-24 11:26 PM] evany.#0000
oh tell me about it


[02-Jun-24 11:27 PM] evany.#0000
as b-r5 kicked off we were still using ventrilo - so many people putting teamviewer id's and passwords in chat "someone take over my titan i have to work i didn't sleep at all"


[02-Jun-24 11:27 PM] evany.#0000
some of us were controlling 15 peoples accounts for them

[02-Jun-24 11:28 PM] tanda#0000
I think it was in the trial stages?

TiDi was kind of always a thing same effect just less controlled

next month will be my 20th year in eve..

[02-Jun-24 11:30 PM] tanda#0000
I haven't touched EVE in a decade, I think


[02-Jun-24 11:30 PM] tanda#0000
constant temptation to go back though


[02-Jun-24 11:30 PM] evany.#0000
just hardware and optimizations got better over the years and they finally controlled the lag by implementing TiDi to try and wrap a container on it so instead of things slowing down and just becoming in-operable, they would deliberately slow things down until they became inoperable


[02-Jun-24 11:31 PM] evany.#0000
same thing just flipped coin


[02-Jun-24 11:31 PM] evany.#0000
well if you want someone to talk you into not coming back, or talk you into coming back feel free to hit me up in a DM or something üòõ

[02-Jun-24 11:39 PM] evany.#0000
its less new player friendly in a lot of ways because most things are now "figured out"
so people will tell you if your doing something the "wrong way"


[02-Jun-24 11:39 PM] tanda#0000
it also seems to have shrunk in scope a bit


[02-Jun-24 11:40 PM] evany.#0000
the most "toxic" part now is people LOVE killboards


[02-Jun-24 11:40 PM] evany.#0000
"HAL U DIDNT GET 20 KILLS THIS MONTH ON THE KILLBOARD WE CANT HAVE YOU WITH US ANYMORE /kick"

"you make us look bad"


[02-Jun-24 11:42 PM] evany.#0000
its no longer acceptable for the name calling or behavious or griefing in many ways yields a ban nowadays. 

most 'griefing' complaints i've seen in the last 5 years is people just not understanding mechanics of the game


[02-Jun-24 11:43 PM] evany.#0000
admittedly there is a ton fo bad advice too, encouraging people to start their own corp to avoid npc taxes rather than join someone elses is the biggest one

should i keep building incinerators even though i don't have the pop to handle them ?

or should i wait another ~3 days before cogc ?


[03-Jun-24 06:19 PM] jvaler#0000
if you trust yourself to place them down before POPR, then you should wait. they provide no benefit without pop and will just add degradation time for nothing


[03-Jun-24 06:20 PM] evany.#0000

yay hot date


[04-Jun-24 02:29 AM] akyantor#0000
Good tip. I hadn't really appriciated this until I've started building a base on a less populated planet. The first two bases were on very high pop planets, so always received enough pop to meet any new demand after placing buildings. Need to keep a closer eye on that figure in brackets under current workforce for the smaller planets. üòõ


[04-Jun-24 02:58 AM] akyantor#0000
I've been thinking about what to do next after I've finished building up my INC farm for C. It doesn't look like many of the planetary upkeep supplies are available on the internal market. If I went focused on them, Would anyone be interested in affordable versions of infrastructure upkeep supplies (e.g. OFF, SUN etc.) ? *It may be there's a good reason no-one does it... maybe the margins are thin - not finished researching it yet*


[04-Jun-24 03:05 AM] evany.#0000
I think people don‚Äôt do these because the only time I‚Äôve seen them used is for hq upgrades which are a one and done kinda thing which probably make them bad to produce if your expecting consistent returns, I‚Äôd wager majority of players never even play long enough to even upgrade, never mind levels 4+ where those come in


[04-Jun-24 04:06 AM] akyantor#0000
I think some have recurring need. For example, looks like if you have a safety station (pop infra) on a planet, then you periodically need to top it up with fresh office supplies. It was those consumables that I was considering focusing on.


[04-Jun-24 04:44 AM] razesdark#0000
It seems to me that a rather small group of players manage a vast amount of the planets.
I assume they have access to the resources they need and thats why the market is really bad.


[04-Jun-24 04:50 AM] flor2081#0000
usually it's cheaper to upgrade your SST than to supply 2/3 or 3/3 of the upkeep


[04-Jun-24 04:50 AM] flor2081#0000
so normally you supply only OFF and upgrade the SST accordingly


[04-Jun-24 04:50 AM] flor2081#0000
which is why SUN isn't really popular for example


[04-Jun-24 04:51 AM] flor2081#0000
and otherwise govs usually make those internally with a constant demand/supply


[04-Jun-24 06:12 AM] jvaler#0000
OFF are pretty good last i checked, if a little hard to sell. SUN don't sell at all cause they're a very cost-inefficient upkeep option


[04-Jun-24 06:12 AM] akyantor#0000
That would explain why OFF seemed to have a somewhat healthy market when I saw others not so much

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[04-Jun-24 06:13 AM] akyantor#0000
It may be I'd need to look across all the pop upkeep items to see which ones actually trade


[04-Jun-24 06:13 AM] akyantor#0000
As they're different for all the building types


[04-Jun-24 06:13 AM] flor2081#0000
well, OFF and TUB are nice


[04-Jun-24 06:14 AM] flor2081#0000
and DW obv


[04-Jun-24 06:14 AM] flor2081#0000
besides that there's UTS, and I'm doing FOD too now on my park


[04-Jun-24 06:19 AM] .urpalhal#0000

I am a governor now üôÉ


[04-Jun-24 06:20 AM] akyantor#0000
I actually had OFF in my current future plans anyway, so maybe that's one to go for


[04-Jun-24 06:20 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think SUN might be another one id need


[04-Jun-24 06:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
But not in any huge amounts


[04-Jun-24 06:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I can check later


[04-Jun-24 06:21 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, doesn't look like that's consumed as much anyway


[04-Jun-24 06:22 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I think if you look at some of the buildings in Population Infrastructure you could see how much they consume


[04-Jun-24 06:22 AM] akyantor#0000
Yeah, that's what I started looking at this morning.


[04-Jun-24 06:22 AM] akyantor#0000

I'm kinda at loose ends as far as immediate plans, I'm dropping CHPs on Elon to round out that base, and then it's a toss up between trying to work towards heavy INS manufacturing or applying for a loan to start working in SE-110


[05-Jun-24 07:21 PM] tanda#0000
is anyone interested in doing plans involving either of those two goals? or has an idea for a project I can help with?


[05-Jun-24 08:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
What all are you making right now?


[05-Jun-24 08:56 PM] tanda#0000
I am currently making AL, BBH, BSE, and MG, with some overflow production in C


[05-Jun-24 08:57 PM] sidepipe#0000
INS can be pretty profitable and I think it should be easy to do on a smaller scale to start out with. I make a ton of extra THF if that helps üôÇ


[05-Jun-24 08:58 PM] tanda#0000
it does immensely, actually


[05-Jun-24 08:58 PM] tanda#0000
the LAB base to make THF is more expensive than the INS base


[05-Jun-24 08:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
And you don‚Äôt need much THF either - I think I‚Äôm #4 on the leaderboard and I only make 720 ish a week üòÑ


[05-Jun-24 08:59 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, a full base of PP3 churning out INS only uses 70 a day


[05-Jun-24 09:01 PM] sidepipe#0000
If you decide to go INS, let me know and we can figure out a fair price for THF üôÇ


[05-Jun-24 09:01 PM] tanda#0000
okay, I will definitely do that


[05-Jun-24 09:02 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm being outrageously undercut in the DDT market right now, so I might switch to making more THF and maybe TCL


[05-Jun-24 09:02 PM] tanda#0000
I've been eyeing that TCL market, but not sure it's liquid enough to take advantage of without being able to produce KV


[05-Jun-24 09:03 PM] tanda#0000
I settled for rounding out my Elon base with CL production


[05-Jun-24 09:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
CL is a nice money maker üôÇ


[05-Jun-24 09:05 PM] sidepipe#0000
Griffonstone CHPs was my third base, I think! Price has gone up a fair bit since then too


[05-Jun-24 09:06 PM] tanda#0000
I look forward to the influx of cash!


[05-Jun-24 09:10 PM] sidepipe#0000
Plus you get to deal with everyone‚Äôs favorite element - NA. I can hardly give the stuff away üòÅ


[05-Jun-24 09:29 PM] tanda#0000
I was looking into that and I'm glad it's worth 25 AIC on the MM


[05-Jun-24 10:16 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I have part of my base on Nike making INS and there seems to be space for more INS production


[05-Jun-24 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
like I've said elsewhere, I want to crash the INS price a bit


[05-Jun-24 10:19 PM] tanda#0000
it's insane how much it costs


[05-Jun-24 10:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'd be careful how much you crash it because PP3 otherwise doesn't make much that is consistently bought on CX


[05-Jun-24 10:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I hopped between making different Rfabs before resting on INS


[06-Jun-24 05:56 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Go for it. PiBoy developed an entire system just for making insane amounts of INS to crash the price. Right as he got going the other biggest INS producer quit... he was holding the price at 120 before, now he has to hold it at 150.


[06-Jun-24 05:57 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
So there's definitely room in that market I think


[07-Jun-24 09:36 AM] antisyntax#0000
is Phobos viable for a second base (farming H2O and O for C production)? Preferably want to keep my starter bases in Ant I, II, or III


[07-Jun-24 09:41 AM] jvaler#0000
phobos has terrible deposits, i wouldn't.

what do you recommend?


[07-Jun-24 09:47 AM] akyantor#0000
tbh, if you want to get into C then I'd have suggested going Harmonia... it's not in ANT I, II, or II, but you have an ample supply of H2O and get a foothold one of the more fertile planets in Antares space. *I started out there, and have since switched to dedicate Harmonia to FRMs and moved INC to 759g, to enable me to expand C production.*

I've currently got rigs on Harmonia... but tbh will start phasing them out soon to have more FRM... not very efficient given how cheap H2O is.

Yeah


[07-Jun-24 10:21 AM] .urpalhal#0000

In the past you have been influenced by good fortune, but lending out the money may lead to either a reverse of fortune for you (good to bad) or new possibilities if you don't wait and make use of the opportunity (to use the cheaper ALO/C)

so the 103 is just because someone filled a request at 103, not that the buy or sell price is 103. because that last bar is for the current period, it indicates that the most recent transaction was at 103

[07-Jun-24 12:58 PM] sidepipe#0000
the one thing I've always wondered is when they say "price" for a candlestick chart, do they mean the bid or the ask? or do they mean the most recent transacted price, whatever that may be


[07-Jun-24 12:59 PM] antisyntax#0000
```
In trading terminology, the "price" shown on the chart typically refers to the last traded price, which is the price at which the most recent transaction occurred. This is neither specifically the buy price (ask price) nor the sell price (bid price) but rather the price at which a buyer and a seller agreed to execute a trade.

In the context of Prosperous Universe, this means that the candlestick chart reflects the prices at which transactions were completed, providing a historical view of the asset's market activity. This last traded price is often used to analyze market trends and price movements.```


[07-Jun-24 01:00 PM] sidepipe#0000
ah got it. that would make sense. otherwise DDT would be at either 2980 (ask) or 2720 (bid), not 2710


[07-Jun-24 01:00 PM] antisyntax#0000
Price on the Chart: Reflects the last traded price (the agreed-upon price between a buyer and a seller).

üëÄ probably more advice than you want üòÜ I've spent far too much time thinking about this leading up to the politics update, lol. But in general, most governors make what they need or buy it in private deals. But the most used upkeep items are OFF and DW. If you want more of a guaranteed income though feel free to DM me. I've been talking with Archiel from OOG about sourcing things, since KAWA and OOG together govern like 30+ planets and over 2m population. So we're the primary consumers of some of the popi specific items and I'll know our shortages better soon

[09-Jun-24 04:35 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
A lot, yeah. But you might struggle with volume at first. A lot of the BRM stuff is rarely made or used but might be if it was cheap (REA, PFE, SOI)

ah, sorry no clue


[09-Jun-24 05:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
true, but I think that based on CoGM there is potential for them to compete. PFE is used in PAR and potentially cheaper to produce than FOD or SOI. REA is used in UNI and is cheaper than BID and COF I think. It's just BRM and CHP to make so it's not crazy ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

The problem you're going to run into though, and the problem with a lot of these on CX, is that most upkeep materials aren't used by most planets. Like, I'm using SUN, FOD, PFE, MHP, HOG, and all sorts of stuff on Katoa that most planets aren't big enough to bother with. *most* planets in the universe can get by with just OFF and/or DW. If dealing with higher tier workforces then you might be looking at UTS, TUB, and HD. Everything else is going to have a *very* small market.


[09-Jun-24 05:25 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Honestly, one thing for POPI that might have a better (but inconsistent and low volume) market is upgrade items. WOR, HAB, LU are all used are all used so infrequently that they're kind of a headache to source. So a single UPF putting some of those on all CX would probably pay for itself well. You probably don't need more than one, but could probably get good prices for the outputs


[09-Jun-24 05:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Sounds like we can put down one base and see how it goes, see if people start using the higher tier stuff from CX if it's available


[09-Jun-24 05:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

[13-Jun-24 02:09 PM] evany.#0000
actually since its the right channel let me ask
are people just building 'whatever' ?
do you have long term goal to make something specific ?


[13-Jun-24 02:09 PM] evany.#0000
my focus thus far in the game has been just to "make number go bigger"


[13-Jun-24 02:10 PM] tanda#0000
my own personal next goal is a 250 expansion on Deimos to allow me to drop 5 more SME, 2 GF, and 1 HWP. Followed immediately by an INS base over on Aceland


[13-Jun-24 02:10 PM] evany.#0000
which has been quite successful considering i spent my first month on deimos doing nothing thanks to xflqr for kicking my ass


[13-Jun-24 02:10 PM] evany.#0000
but aside from continuing to upscale i'm curious what others are doing


[13-Jun-24 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
On Aceland? Isn‚Äôt that construction?


[13-Jun-24 02:11 PM] tanda#0000
yes, and INS is PP3


[13-Jun-24 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh üò• my brain read that as INC not INS


[13-Jun-24 02:11 PM] .urpalhal#0000
üôÉ


[13-Jun-24 02:12 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Goals are to make HAL and what ever else tickles my fancy


[13-Jun-24 02:14 PM] tanda#0000
To be quite honest, my long term goal is to move into and exploit the SE-110 system to enable cheaper RAT and DW for the area


[13-Jun-24 02:14 PM] tanda#0000
I'm kinda working on things that's going to make that goal cheaper as well, hence the INS base


[13-Jun-24 02:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh yeah I go to SE-110 too to make C


[13-Jun-24 02:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
For PPP


[13-Jun-24 02:21 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
hit me up if you need cheap INS...


[13-Jun-24 02:22 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
idk what quantities we're talking but I can help for sure. I've got more than I need and I've already set aside my own stockpile


[13-Jun-24 02:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
**the** HAL mine always needs INS for repairs ‚ò∫Ô∏è


[13-Jun-24 02:24 PM] tanda#0000
I will likely do that, but the point of the INS is to drop the price on the ANT CX as well. I would like to target 115/unit


[13-Jun-24 02:34 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that would take a *big* opperation. I think one person could do it but it would be *a lot* of your company. Or you could start up a project. Piboy is aiming for 120 I think but had to raise it to 150 temporarily after another huge producer quit.


[13-Jun-24 02:34 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I think dropping the price of special construction materials to make more options accessible is a fantastic goal though. I can supply PE for the INS if you decide to make it


[13-Jun-24 02:34 PM] tanda#0000
a lot of my company? worth it


[13-Jun-24 02:35 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We're gonna do it how we did with PG


[13-Jun-24 02:35 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I don't see dropping INS being harder


[13-Jun-24 02:36 PM] tanda#0000
I believe we are attempting to step up a PE base on Hephaestus and two INS bases, I'm targeting Aceland for mine


[13-Jun-24 02:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I was gonna plan it out tomorrow when I have time


[13-Jun-24 02:37 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
But aceland + Haphaestus sounds fine


[13-Jun-24 02:37 PM] igfloz#0000
oh, I was looking at adding PE to my existing Heph base - Not large, but additional manufacture


[13-Jun-24 02:38 PM] tanda#0000
you're the boss, but when I was looking at it, those were the locations I was looking at


[13-Jun-24 02:39 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
INS isn't too hard to ship, which means that like PG, it will be challenging to drop the price on any individual CX. Arbitrage will be easy so if there's enough margin people will ship and resell it. You'd need enough production to drop the cost globally.


[13-Jun-24 02:40 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
PiBoy has probably over 10 bases completely dedicated to just INS production and couldn't keep it at 120. It'll take quite the effort to actually pull it down significantly.


[13-Jun-24 02:41 PM] tanda#0000
perhaps I should reach out to PiBoy and see if he need some bases to chip in


[13-Jun-24 02:41 PM] tanda#0000
rather than trying to reinvent the wheel


[13-Jun-24 02:42 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
that's fair. he's super nice and has the same goal. He set up a whole system for the production and could probably help a lot.


[13-Jun-24 02:42 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I mean, look at this lead... I haven't even looked this up before, that gap is insane...

math based on those numbers, you'd only need about 92 more PP3 to get first...

(this means PiBoy has like 100 PP3..., that's crazy)

[13-Jun-24 02:51 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Then he's making ~11k. Each dedicated PP3 base can make ~1.7k


[13-Jun-24 02:51 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
We don't need to make as much, a third or half would make a dent


[13-Jun-24 02:52 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
especially if you work with him. I don't think he's that far from being able to push it back down to 120 or lower.


[13-Jun-24 02:53 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
If you set up your own project, but also plan to overproduce the inputs that he needs more of too, then you would add to supply and increase his supply at the same time.


[13-Jun-24 02:53 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Just see what his bottleneck is and maybe work it into your own plans if it makes sense.


[13-Jun-24 02:54 PM] cptcoleslaw#0000
(he is also an amazing resource for starting up your own corp or setting up a discord for a corp. He's the one that set up everything for KAWA's original members years ago)

Goal devalue everything so everyone can be high level player


[13-Jun-24 03:34 PM] jvaler#0000
definitely, cause piboy also supplies all 4 CXes. so if we just focus on ANT we'll have a much bigger impact for the same resources

Who's interested in helping with the INS project ? ANY player welcome (but preference for players not already doing another CULT project), we'll pitch in if you don't have enough money. Our goal is to build enough INS bases to bring the price down to 115/u so that building bases on planets where INS is needed can be easier

We need 1 more INS person, plan here: https://prunplanner.org/shared/a4a2b987-ae7c-45f0-800b-9d67d57be23d
And one more PE person: https://prunplanner.org/shared/0b86af96-96a9-4ca6-ad17-78b105b0633e

We are likely to be adding more INS bases in the future as well

[19-Jun-24 03:34 PM] histidinedwarf#0000

I could be interested in helping out, but I'm not sure I have the means to do it. I really need to upgrade at least one of my ships to a WCB quite quick.


[19-Jun-24 08:59 PM] tanda#0000
which spot are you interested in? PE is pretty low on shipping requirements and is based on Heph, so you'd have quick trips to the CX

[20-Jun-24 02:53 AM] razesdark#0000
The Aceland base looks quite nice, timing wise. That shouldn't be that big of a deal to manage, even before I upgrade my ships. The ability to pay for such a base however is a different matter all together. 
The BMP base is more something I can pay a considerable piece of.


[21-Jun-24 09:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Just need one more person for the INS base. Eventually will probably go hunting for more people on UFO or COM channels if nobody's interested. Sidepipe agreed to give a 0% loan for the whole base as well


[21-Jun-24 09:30 PM] jvaler#0000

Question or statement ?


[21-Jun-24 09:35 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
The idea is to build on Aceland since a lot of people already have a Nike base and it's better for bfabs anyway


[21-Jun-24 09:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
@histidinedwarf if no one else comes forward, I might build the 3rd base - would free up my PP3s on Nike for other things üôÇ


[21-Jun-24 09:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or is it pp2s?


[21-Jun-24 09:39 PM] sidepipe#0000

and at the end of the day, due to the higher cost of the burn, the 25 INC version only makes 1k more AIC per day

[22-Jun-24 01:39 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
If i'm not mistaken by your calculations in PrUn it seems more value just selling the output from farms instead of using them in C production. Atleast for the price its running on in Ant in the moment


[22-Jun-24 01:40 PM] evany.#0000
absolutely not


[22-Jun-24 01:40 PM] tanda#0000
if you tried to sell all that GRN you would crash the price

when i nreality market average is  like half that, 200'ish

prunplanner makes it look good but it doesn't seem to be in reality


[22-Jun-24 01:48 PM] evany.#0000
and that was an option yeah.


[22-Jun-24 01:48 PM] igfloz#0000
I find the prunplanner can either under - or over estimate production rates. the figures don't match what I see in game


[22-Jun-24 01:48 PM] evany.#0000
im actually doing it at this point just to reduce my reliance on GRN


[22-Jun-24 01:48 PM] evany.#0000
my GRN supply isn't lazy its just a lot of GRN.


[22-Jun-24 01:49 PM] evany.#0000
originally when i was doing the math on the whole thing i was only looking at it economically i wasn't looking at supply issues


[22-Jun-24 01:49 PM] tanda#0000
keep in mind that using HCP reduces the amount of GRN you need by about 25%


[22-Jun-24 01:49 PM] evany.#0000
reality has now set in and supply issues are a thing.


[22-Jun-24 01:49 PM] evany.#0000
yes thats li terally why


[22-Jun-24 01:50 PM] tanda#0000
but also you're hauling even more


[22-Jun-24 01:50 PM] evany.#0000
oh hauling is fine supply issues are actually sourcing the material


[22-Jun-24 01:50 PM] tanda#0000
how much GRN are you coming up short?


[22-Jun-24 01:50 PM] evany.#0000
its worked great so far because my suppliers had about 7k backstock


[22-Jun-24 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
while i was spooling up they had a few weeks to build


[22-Jun-24 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
but now i'm waiting for buy orders to fill


[22-Jun-24 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
they are producing around 300 and i'm burning 450/day


[22-Jun-24 01:51 PM] tanda#0000
so one additional supplier would fix your current needs


[22-Jun-24 01:51 PM] evany.#0000
so if i started to hyf grn/hcp/mai my grn supply would be fine and my carbon would go up


[22-Jun-24 01:52 PM] evany.#0000
or even just grn/hcp


[22-Jun-24 01:52 PM] evany.#0000
or yes, one more GRN supplier


[22-Jun-24 01:52 PM] tanda#0000
since you are running single burn right now, can you even supply your INC with the amount of HCP you would need?


[22-Jun-24 01:52 PM] evany.#0000
easily


[22-Jun-24 01:53 PM] evany.#0000
well, i shouldnt say easily


[22-Jun-24 01:53 PM] evany.#0000
because it would be mixed


[22-Jun-24 01:53 PM] evany.#0000
if hyf just produces hcp its 700/day and i need 600


[22-Jun-24 01:53 PM] igfloz#0000
Should consider time, for production and hauling


[22-Jun-24 01:53 PM] evany.#0000
if istart producing mai on top of that though ..


[22-Jun-24 01:54 PM] evany.#0000
thats easy, you just dont switch production until your ready aka have enough hauled/stored


[22-Jun-24 01:55 PM] tanda#0000
personally I would readily swap over to a double burn using the HYF. Going triple actually increases your GRN need by about 50% but if you're doing mixed double burn  GRN/HCP MAI/HCP you won't really even need all the contacts you've built to supply your GRN


[22-Jun-24 01:57 PM] tanda#0000
you run a triple permit INC base, right?


[22-Jun-24 01:57 PM] evany.#0000
Yeah


[22-Jun-24 01:58 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Seems it cant be produced enough agricultrual


[22-Jun-24 01:59 PM] tanda#0000
honestly I would totally do this: Have one of your suppliers swap to MAI production, drop that HYF base and just make HCP. Then run the mixed double burn and you'lll be solid (except for the fact that you're now producing 650 C a day which has to be transported)


[22-Jun-24 02:00 PM] tanda#0000
your cost per C will go up, but PrunPlanner says it's only like about 40 per unit


[22-Jun-24 02:03 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
I had a excel sheet for it and the different between a singel burn and tripple burn is 100 per unit when buing from market. When self produce its not as much as a difference. The question being if selling it or putting it to the burn is the best economical thing. Since a productipn of HCP is about 30 a unit or something and it sells for 250 atm


[22-Jun-24 02:08 PM] tanda#0000
if I sold all my GRN at current market rates, I make 24k less per day than if I single burn it


[22-Jun-24 02:08 PM] tanda#0000
for triple it likely will make you more money to just sell the inputs rather than burning them


[22-Jun-24 02:09 PM] evany.#0000
your right


[22-Jun-24 02:09 PM] evany.#0000
thats why i struggled with the whole idea


[22-Jun-24 02:10 PM] evany.#0000
but when you compare it to having broken input because you can't feed it 500grn/day with 66 incinerators


[22-Jun-24 02:10 PM] evany.#0000
a few more material burn grn/hcp suddenly makes a lot more sense


[22-Jun-24 02:10 PM] evany.#0000
even if its just in bursts and i do 2 straight grn and 1 grn/hcp


[22-Jun-24 02:11 PM] tanda#0000
I do that to burn off my excess GRN every so often


[22-Jun-24 02:13 PM] evany.#0000
you do hcp recipe eh


[22-Jun-24 02:13 PM] tanda#0000
only when I get above 3k GRN in backlog


[22-Jun-24 02:14 PM] tanda#0000
and I just buy the HCP off the market


[22-Jun-24 02:52 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôm going to use Harmonia and SE-110b to feed a triple burn INC


[22-Jun-24 03:30 PM] ratgorwesbar#0000
Btw whats the best water planet??

you do duo when you don't max out INC, like on a nascent base

oh hey, more channels


[24-Jun-24 09:00 PM] tanda#0000
I like it, and any issues I may have with it will be things you can grow out of with more permits and some time

well, i, uh


[24-Jun-24 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000
didn't actually plan on it


[24-Jun-24 09:03 PM] tanda#0000
I would suggest though, that you split it between FLX and CL


[24-Jun-24 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000
i started building out b3 first


[24-Jun-24 09:03 PM] jcheung#0000
and then went "i'm paying way too much for chemicals"


[24-Jun-24 09:04 PM] tanda#0000
yeah me too. I'm looking at dropping a Bober base here in the near future, it's just going to do FLX NS and CL


[24-Jun-24 09:04 PM] tanda#0000

that said, it's subject to change and won't be built for.... at least a few months

kinda thinking of doing a simple HCP/GRN -> 1/2 ALO 1/2 C base on Nascent


[25-Jun-24 05:15 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I had a CM there for like a month before I did anything with it


[25-Jun-24 05:15 PM] razenpok#0000
Ye, I dropped a CM there because it was shrinking by 3-4 plots a day


[25-Jun-24 05:15 PM] razenpok#0000

Meh proxion


[25-Jun-24 05:16 PM] jvaler#0000
i've been debating if i wanna get in that ship before it sails


[25-Jun-24 05:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
With the weebs?


[25-Jun-24 05:17 PM] jvaler#0000
i just don't think i can be bothered. i either do logistics for the base myself, annoyingly outsource it to the LM, or do tedious contracts with KAWA


[25-Jun-24 05:17 PM] jvaler#0000
i get enough of that 2nd option with my boucher base


[25-Jun-24 05:17 PM] jvaler#0000
thankfully rise takes the water, all i do is consumables+repairs


[25-Jun-24 05:18 PM] jvaler#0000
weebs?


[25-Jun-24 05:18 PM] .shiva.#0000
well, w/e farms are cheap. can always deconstruct later I guess


[25-Jun-24 05:19 PM] jvaler#0000
mhm


[25-Jun-24 05:19 PM] jvaler#0000
cheapest base to build in the game, that's one of the main reasons it's such a highly recommended starting profession


[25-Jun-24 05:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
People who like japan and Japanese culture who want to be Japanese but aren‚Äôt Japanese


[25-Jun-24 05:19 PM] jvaler#0000
ik what it is, just don't know what it has to do with proxion :P


[25-Jun-24 05:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh


[25-Jun-24 05:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Bc Daikoku is Japanese


[25-Jun-24 05:20 PM] jvaler#0000
ohhhh


[25-Jun-24 05:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
And so is Kawa


[25-Jun-24 05:20 PM] jvaler#0000

[25-Jun-24 05:20 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Lots of Japanese stuff over there


[25-Jun-24 05:20 PM] jvaler#0000
i had no idea lmao


[25-Jun-24 05:21 PM] .shiva.#0000
yeah, I just won't really be able to deal w/ the extra shipping to deal w/ the INC/ALO side of things till the WCBs come in. buffer up some grn/hcp or LM I guess


[25-Jun-24 05:22 PM] jvaler#0000
speaking of, i should go determine the WCB priorities


[25-Jun-24 05:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean I could help maybe?


[25-Jun-24 05:23 PM] .shiva.#0000
eh, no biggie. I just meant I was gonna hold off til I could, but may as well get the Harmonia one going now, and deal w/ Nascent in a bit. gonna have a busy couple weeks anyways


[25-Jun-24 05:23 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Oh ok ‚ò∫Ô∏è


[25-Jun-24 05:24 PM] sidepipe#0000
@.shiva. If you don‚Äôt want to deal with shipping, I‚Äôll buy crops off you at Harmonia at CX price until you‚Äôre ready to do the INC


[25-Jun-24 05:25 PM] evany.#0000
i would do the same ^


[25-Jun-24 05:25 PM] evany.#0000
sidepipe types faster than me apparently


[25-Jun-24 05:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
@evany. can have dibs üòÑ


[25-Jun-24 05:26 PM] evany.#0000
do you operate on harmonia @sidepipe


[25-Jun-24 05:27 PM] sidepipe#0000
Since day 1 üôÇ


[25-Jun-24 05:27 PM] .shiva.#0000
ah that'd be great, ty! I'll sort the Harmonia base in the next few days, I'd guess mid-july for when I'll get Nascent going tbh


[25-Jun-24 05:27 PM] evany.#0000
your priorities might have changed by then


[25-Jun-24 05:27 PM] evany.#0000
i still don't have the second base i was going to build built.. opportunities present themselves and you go different directions!


[25-Jun-24 05:28 PM] .shiva.#0000
eh, I do want it for the ALO, was just going to do 50/50 for now since I don't need more than a full SME permit's worth of it atm


[25-Jun-24 05:31 PM] .shiva.#0000
this is what I've got vaguely planned for 4 permits

[25-Jun-24 06:14 PM] evany.#0000
you probably understand why that won't work then eh ?


[25-Jun-24 06:15 PM] evany.#0000
demeter is a good alternate for hcp - i don't know an alternate to nascent. aceland maybe ?


[25-Jun-24 06:16 PM] evany.#0000
oh sorry aceland is construction. halcyon


[25-Jun-24 06:16 PM] jvaler#0000
you can reduce EXT to be able to run more single input GRN C

[25-Jun-24 06:17 PM] jvaler#0000
what's wrong with it?


[25-Jun-24 06:18 PM] evany.#0000
gonna have a tough time doing inc & ext on nascent


[25-Jun-24 06:18 PM] evany.#0000
at least; full area anyway


[25-Jun-24 06:18 PM] jvaler#0000
i've done it for months :P


[25-Jun-24 06:18 PM] jvaler#0000
you can outsource ALO exports to darkfuel on the ANT LM


[25-Jun-24 06:19 PM] jvaler#0000
20-25k AIC for 1000(WCB) or 1481(LCB) ALO seems to be their minimum


[25-Jun-24 06:19 PM] jvaler#0000
pretty reasonable imo


[25-Jun-24 06:20 PM] jvaler#0000
then if you don't have to do ALO yourself you just have to export 1k C in a WCB like once every ~9 days


[25-Jun-24 06:21 PM] evany.#0000
you've probably run the numbers already- that makes sense?


[25-Jun-24 06:21 PM] evany.#0000
color me stupid then; jvaler knows more than i


[25-Jun-24 06:21 PM] jvaler#0000
well that's literally my current base setup lol


[25-Jun-24 06:21 PM] jvaler#0000
but yeah


[25-Jun-24 06:22 PM] jvaler#0000
you can see the total export mass/volume in the first screenshot


[25-Jun-24 06:22 PM] evany.#0000
i suppose as long as the COGC matches


[25-Jun-24 06:22 PM] evany.#0000
yeah fair enough


[25-Jun-24 06:23 PM] jvaler#0000
that's exactly why it's so ideal. INC take up relatively little area, and you can get a wide range of agri consumption rates out of them due to their variable input recipes


[25-Jun-24 06:23 PM] jvaler#0000
so i could even expand my agri production to get more C out of this same nascent base by using a triple input recipe


[25-Jun-24 06:23 PM] evany.#0000
yea just recipe swap


[25-Jun-24 06:24 PM] evany.#0000
i'm considering doing it myself


[25-Jun-24 06:24 PM] jvaler#0000
you're looking at demeter?


[25-Jun-24 06:24 PM] evany.#0000
looking at harmonia


[25-Jun-24 06:24 PM] evany.#0000
but for nascent yes


[25-Jun-24 06:24 PM] jvaler#0000
oh lol

hyf some HCP

[25-Jun-24 06:25 PM] evany.#0000
instead of making more grn i to alleviate supply issues, i can make some hcp to alleviate supply issues AND get more carbon out of it


[25-Jun-24 06:25 PM] evany.#0000
just need to come up with enough money to drop hyf's!

[25-Jun-24 06:26 PM] .shiva.#0000
ah yeah, that does make everything line up closer. I'm thinking about being a little lazy and dropping a FRM for 3xRIG on Harmonia, it's not worth but does let you not deal w/ importing water at all really


[25-Jun-24 06:26 PM] evany.#0000
and probably need a 2k/2k to keep it fed..


[25-Jun-24 06:27 PM] jvaler#0000
i originally did that too, but i realized it made 0 difference in logistical strain. you're never importing a full load of anything into harmonia, so it makes no difference to just take some water with you


[25-Jun-24 06:27 PM] jvaler#0000
it's only ever ~200t/200m^3 of consumables


[25-Jun-24 06:28 PM] jvaler#0000
the remaining room is enough to fit weeks of water


[25-Jun-24 06:29 PM] .shiva.#0000
sigh fine, I'll be less lazy lol


[25-Jun-24 06:31 PM] jvaler#0000
technically it should be barely more work, but i found it more satisfying to my laziness when i can shove months of upkeep in a base and only worry about exporting every other week :P

BRN is pretty close


[25-Jun-24 06:33 PM] .shiva.#0000
if you recipe swap it'll get mixed up a tiny bit

but it's close enough


[25-Jun-24 06:34 PM] jvaler#0000

[25-Jun-24 08:21 PM] jcheung#0000
I gotta figure out what it does


[25-Jun-24 08:24 PM] jvaler#0000
do `XIT HELP` in a new buffer


[25-Jun-24 08:24 PM] jvaler#0000
assuming you have it installed already


[25-Jun-24 08:26 PM] tanda#0000
what's going on with Thalassa-D?


[25-Jun-24 08:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
its chilling, I keep forgeting to send a ship out there with GRN


[25-Jun-24 08:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so it should be 0


[25-Jun-24 08:29 PM] tanda#0000
man, Halcyon is quite the money maker for you even with you selling it at 150


[25-Jun-24 08:30 PM] jvaler#0000
remember it's triple permit, but those are still great numbers


[25-Jun-24 08:30 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm just looking at the balance between produced and consumed

sometimes i  sell at 100/u shhh

oh and IG malahat techincally makes me ~30k/d


[25-Jun-24 08:35 PM] jvaler#0000
i don't think PMMG actually takes real sale price into account. it thinks i make 100k/d on heph which i technically do, but i don't often sell it at market prices

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[25-Jun-24 08:36 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, I'm aware of that. Do you think it takes purchase price into account for the consumed category?


[25-Jun-24 08:36 PM] tanda#0000
or just current market value?


[25-Jun-24 08:36 PM] jvaler#0000
i'm not sure... i'd assume the latter?


[25-Jun-24 08:37 PM] .shiva.#0000
Id kinda assume it just multiplies out your burn


[25-Jun-24 08:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I sold like 4k HAL today/yesterday and my equity shows that bc I think it was pricing it at 300/u not the 150/u I sold it at

[25-Jun-24 08:37 PM] jcheung#0000
I don't see how it could track purchase price.
There's RL inventory systems that struggle with that


[25-Jun-24 08:37 PM] jcheung#0000
And those systems cost like $100/mo or more


[25-Jun-24 08:39 PM] jvaler#0000
i think you can see where my afabs sold the other day and i gained 12mil. it must have been undervaluing it?

that's what I'm proud of


[25-Jun-24 08:42 PM] jcheung#0000
Actually, what's a decent income/d for a 500a base


[25-Jun-24 08:42 PM] jcheung#0000
I know it depends on the base type, but on the low end what could be expected?


[25-Jun-24 08:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
uh i think my harmonia farm does like 30k/d


[25-Jun-24 08:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
which is low


[25-Jun-24 08:43 PM] .urpalhal#0000
and thats the full 500 area


[25-Jun-24 08:43 PM] jcheung#0000
Okay, cool


[25-Jun-24 08:43 PM] tanda#0000
you can look at my bases up there and just discount Malahat and Deimos (750 area)


[25-Jun-24 08:43 PM] tanda#0000
those are going to be pretty typical

equity is everything afaik
liquid+materials+buildings


[25-Jun-24 08:47 PM] jvaler#0000
25-35k/d is serviceable, 35-50k/d is average, 50-70k/d is great, and anything above is excellent

you only really see the first range when looking at stuff where the market is terrible at the moment, or FRMs. FRMs are still good despite the low numbers due to their low cost to build, giving them good ROI periods


[25-Jun-24 08:50 PM] jcheung#0000

question regarding WKP kits


[25-Jun-24 09:43 PM] jcheung#0000
is there someone internally making LHP?


[25-Jun-24 09:43 PM] evany.#0000
yes there is one person in #internal-offers kz_kawasaki


[25-Jun-24 09:44 PM] evany.#0000
bit of a wait, though


[25-Jun-24 09:45 PM] jcheung#0000
thinking about plopping down a HWP


[25-Jun-24 09:45 PM] jcheung#0000
is why i'm asking


[25-Jun-24 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
I am very slowly making LHP, about 17 a day

[25-Jun-24 09:47 PM] jcheung#0000
how much of that stuff do you need lol


[25-Jun-24 09:48 PM] tanda#0000
for repairs? like 10 at 80%ish


[25-Jun-24 09:48 PM] tanda#0000
let me run the blueprints again

hes right. 10 @ 80%ish


[25-Jun-24 09:48 PM] evany.#0000
i confirm - i just repaired my ships yesterday


[25-Jun-24 09:49 PM] tanda#0000
looks like you need 64 for the BHP to LHP conversion


[25-Jun-24 09:52 PM] evany.#0000
i need 94 tanda


[25-Jun-24 09:52 PM] tanda#0000
with more AL producers coming into our little group, I might swap out a couple smelters for another HWP so we have steady supply internally


[25-Jun-24 09:52 PM] evany.#0000
funny you mention that since nyan is dropping a smelting base, igfloz dropped ALO and my stuff lands at deimos tonight to spin up smelting


[25-Jun-24 09:53 PM] evany.#0000
so i will be less reliant on you in the future at some point (well, for AL..)


[25-Jun-24 09:53 PM] tanda#0000
I've been selling AL internally for so long I don't think I've sold any on the CX in a minute, lol


[25-Jun-24 09:54 PM] tanda#0000
a HWP seems like a good idea, I'll try to move that into place in the next week


[25-Jun-24 09:54 PM] tanda#0000
good news is I'll have 94 LHP in about 3 days of production at current rate (17 per day)


[25-Jun-24 09:55 PM] evany.#0000
i don't know if ill need it all that soon - but i need a 2k/2k/

[25-Jun-24 09:56 PM] evany.#0000
i can't afford the whole ship rn but i might ask him to do a deal like half now half later


[25-Jun-24 09:56 PM] evany.#0000
idk if he will go for that


[25-Jun-24 09:56 PM] tanda#0000
through the WKP program? I thought those were loans?


[25-Jun-24 09:56 PM] evany.#0000

new ship


[25-Jun-24 09:57 PM] evany.#0000
rise sells them for like ~5m


[25-Jun-24 09:57 PM] tanda#0000
oof yeah, might want to just keep it simple and take out a loan for it


[25-Jun-24 09:57 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. can someone review two base designs for me and give me your thoughts?
[hep](https://prunplanner.org/shared/1070f553-cfbf-46f1-8154-0d68e797cdd2) base was designed with a requirement of 12 NL/d output
[deimos](https://prunplanner.org/shared/bc1fafd6-0198-4ffb-9184-9281ab10beab) was designed with requirement of 65 GL/d output


[25-Jun-24 09:57 PM] evany.#0000
well even if he agrees to loan i still need to buy lhp and ssc myself


[25-Jun-24 09:57 PM] evany.#0000
so ill need your part regardless


[25-Jun-24 09:58 PM] jcheung#0000
no, i'm not trying to *get* the stuff


[25-Jun-24 09:58 PM] jcheung#0000

[25-Jun-24 09:59 PM] tanda#0000
that's why I buy ALO strictly from the LM unless things get bad

at least with the fuel tank setup schaitr gives


[25-Jun-24 10:00 PM] tanda#0000
okay, cool


[25-Jun-24 10:00 PM] jcheung#0000
what do you get back when you do a ship upgrade?


[25-Jun-24 10:00 PM] jvaler#0000
but i've already sourced LHP for all 12 current kits, so that's not a concern


[25-Jun-24 10:00 PM] evany.#0000
nothing


[25-Jun-24 10:01 PM] jcheung#0000
sorry, i mean what resources don't you have to spend compared to building a new ship


[25-Jun-24 10:01 PM] evany.#0000
oh. a lot


[25-Jun-24 10:01 PM] tanda#0000
oh good, I got worried for a second, lol


[25-Jun-24 10:01 PM] evany.#0000
to build a new starter ship i read that it was over 3mil, but to upgrade its only ~800k

[25-Jun-24 10:02 PM] jcheung#0000
are there any shipyard fees?


[25-Jun-24 10:02 PM] evany.#0000
in reality you'd never _build_ a starter ship


[25-Jun-24 10:02 PM] jvaler#0000
3mil is a generous offer from rise, it could even be more


[25-Jun-24 10:02 PM] jvaler#0000
nope


[25-Jun-24 10:02 PM] jcheung#0000
how do you determine the cost difference


[25-Jun-24 10:02 PM] jvaler#0000
you sum the cost of the parts required for the construction or upgrade


[25-Jun-24 10:02 PM] evany.#0000
a lot of spreadsheeting


[25-Jun-24 10:03 PM] tanda#0000
okay, I love the variety of things you're doing here but I see some pain in this


[25-Jun-24 10:03 PM] tanda#0000
STL is not something I would want in a starter ship


[25-Jun-24 10:03 PM] evany.#0000
and praying the items are even available^


[25-Jun-24 10:03 PM] evany.#0000
the plan is admirable but doesn't look noob friendly


[25-Jun-24 10:03 PM] evany.#0000
look at the deim-plan import/export requirements per day.. wow


[25-Jun-24 10:04 PM] evany.#0000
dozens of resources being maintained


[25-Jun-24 10:04 PM] evany.#0000
i struggled for my first 50 days maintaining my simple 1 item production lines


[25-Jun-24 10:04 PM] jcheung#0000
STL isn't something i intend to produce a lot of, i should have diluted that with AL and FE some. forgot to do so.
it's for PT use on the hep BMPs


[25-Jun-24 10:04 PM] evany.#0000
i don't see how a new player would maintain that through its ups and downs


[25-Jun-24 10:04 PM] jvaler#0000
that's not bad? easily doable with a single starter


[25-Jun-24 10:05 PM] jvaler#0000
but i'm worried about the GL, last i checked that wasn't very lucrative. i'd need to get on the computer to check though


[25-Jun-24 10:06 PM] evany.#0000
400m3/d is certainly doable especially with two starters.. but your gonna be doing daily trips dragging back and forth praying things have sold by the time you login next


[25-Jun-24 10:06 PM] evany.#0000
not realistic in my (limited) experience


[25-Jun-24 10:06 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, no part of the GL is really profitable. Good variety for BTA, but even I'm processing it into RG for Rfabs


[25-Jun-24 10:07 PM] jcheung#0000
i guess i should mention that the GL and NL mentioned for 'requirements' would be pre-sold to hal


[25-Jun-24 10:07 PM] jcheung#0000
at least for the near future


[25-Jun-24 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
ah, yeah. That makes sense


[25-Jun-24 10:07 PM] jvaler#0000
and at the point where you only make it for self sufficiency it's better to just buy it off the CX
so...


[25-Jun-24 10:08 PM] jcheung#0000
without messing with prices, it's showing 5k/d with a ROI of 11d right now


[25-Jun-24 10:08 PM] jcheung#0000
and i'd be tactically acquiring NA from sidepipe


[25-Jun-24 10:09 PM] jvaler#0000
what are your CX settings? i don't trust anything other than both buy and sell being set to AI1Ask


[25-Jun-24 10:09 PM] jvaler#0000
maybe u already did that, but just wanna make sure :P

hmm


[25-Jun-24 10:10 PM] jvaler#0000
well in that case it'd be even better than projected i guess?


[25-Jun-24 10:10 PM] tanda#0000
for something like a HWP, is it worth even having the support for 10 TEC?


[25-Jun-24 10:10 PM] jvaler#0000
cause i hope you don't sell to bids lol


[25-Jun-24 10:11 PM] tanda#0000
I don't even have habs for them


[25-Jun-24 10:11 PM] jcheung#0000
gl prices do look like they went up recently


[25-Jun-24 10:11 PM] jcheung#0000
looking at longer trend, it was at an all time low two months ago


[25-Jun-24 10:12 PM] jcheung#0000
err. maybe not all time low


[25-Jun-24 10:12 PM] jcheung#0000
but low over 180d


[25-Jun-24 10:12 PM] jvaler#0000

WPL heavy on heph, i like it


[25-Jun-24 10:15 PM] jcheung#0000
well. 12NL/d reserved for hal, so that leaves 6/d to slowly sell elsewhere


[25-Jun-24 10:15 PM] jcheung#0000
at max output that is


[25-Jun-24 10:15 PM] jcheung#0000

those PSM & PSS might not sell very well, but you could always change up the recipes easily

oh god CXPC is barren


[25-Jun-24 10:18 PM] jcheung#0000

engineer upkeep

i could always swap one of the PPFs to a BMP as well


[25-Jun-24 10:21 PM] tanda#0000
so you mentioned having some long term contracts locked in. Do you have the funding to set this up, or do you need more time?

y'know you could still get an AGP grant on top of that. just to make your situation a little more comfortable ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

also pricy to produce üò¨


[25-Jun-24 10:32 PM] jvaler#0000
though that might not make up for current AL prices... yeah


[25-Jun-24 10:32 PM] jvaler#0000
but you're making AL yourself so "if i make it myself it's free" ü§™


[25-Jun-24 10:32 PM] jcheung#0000
welll


[25-Jun-24 10:32 PM] jcheung#0000
"free" might be a misnomer

[25-Jun-24 10:32 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah lol, just joking


[25-Jun-24 10:32 PM] tanda#0000
if I'm making my AL myself it's significantly cheaper


[25-Jun-24 10:33 PM] tanda#0000
especially since I make my own C, and my own GRN


[25-Jun-24 10:33 PM] jcheung#0000
i marked it as 400/u cost though, instead of 700 or whatever cx is


[25-Jun-24 10:33 PM] jcheung#0000
which might drop if i start trading C from cheaper sources


[25-Jun-24 10:33 PM] jvaler#0000
the AL isn't cheaper, the AL still costs market price. you're just making lots of value by producing it while it's so expensive


[25-Jun-24 10:34 PM] jcheung#0000
hwp adds almost no value compared to selling AL straight (actually i think it might lose a little)


[25-Jun-24 10:34 PM] jcheung#0000
that said, it reduces weight by a good margin which means i can store more shtuff üòÑ

I have a base on harmonia. Would HYF work better for RCO? Afaik FAR is rather slow for it

or if you have PMMG installed it allows you to just do `PLI harmonia` and it autocorrects

FRM is slower, but less H2O, so it's kinda trade off I think


[26-Jun-24 04:52 PM] jcheung#0000
At work so mobile limited

i do too, but only for reactor. completely minimum engine usage is pretty bad, you get huge gains from bumping it up even a single pip above minimum

and always remember to abuse the flight calculation bug, where if you just click the same fuel settings again it has a random(?) chance to choose between 2 different flight path calculations. one of those calculations is almost always superior in every way: time, degradation, and fuel usage

[26-Jun-24 04:58 PM] jvaler#0000
this only applies to FTL flights though, the bug is still present with STL flights but there are no gains when comparing the two options

it's still a bug though afaik

even though it's been in the game for like forever afaik lmao


[26-Jun-24 05:03 PM] jcheung#0000
Orbital mechanics took the day off. I found that starter ship doesn't give a shit about how much mass you have in fuel or cargo


[26-Jun-24 05:04 PM] jcheung#0000
With some alterations to ship design, 1300-1500 total mass it doesn't care


[26-Jun-24 05:04 PM] jvaler#0000
oh yeah, mass has minimal effects on flight time because it only affects the STL portion of the flight. ship volume is the determining factor for the FTL portion


[26-Jun-24 05:04 PM] jcheung#0000
Above that it does


[26-Jun-24 05:05 PM] jcheung#0000
IRL if you increase the mass by 50% you bet your ass you're paying for it lol


[26-Jun-24 05:05 PM] jvaler#0000
lolol


[26-Jun-24 05:05 PM] jvaler#0000
well irl we don't have FTL capabilities :P


[26-Jun-24 05:05 PM] jcheung#0000
Well


[26-Jun-24 05:05 PM] jcheung#0000
We were talking about sublight


[26-Jun-24 05:07 PM] jcheung#0000
I have too many hours in KSP to not complain about the mass üòÑ


[26-Jun-24 05:07 PM] jvaler#0000
but a large portion of the flight time of ships ingame is spent in FTL


[26-Jun-24 05:07 PM] jvaler#0000
so it's not 1:1 comparable


[26-Jun-24 05:08 PM] jcheung#0000
At the same time, a not insignificant amount of time is spent getting to open space to jump


[26-Jun-24 05:10 PM] jvaler#0000
8hrs spent in FTL, 3hrs in STL

independently, none of them are *good* ideas, but they each serve their purpose


[29-Jun-24 05:52 PM] evany.#0000
i'd also say its easy to add that depending on your purpose its kind of normal i.e you see people spin up water bases that are only half-built because they dont require it to be full or maybe have the means / logistic hell to haul it
so if you had a different material you could do it there too. "simple" things like that.

personally for more advanced products i can't imagine it makes sense to be tracking a dozen inputs it probably doesn't make sense to say throw down 3 SME, 3 GF, 3 HWP, 3 SKF on deimos for example even though technically it would work / match cogc

its more of a 'problem solving' base


[29-Jun-24 06:01 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Peak base design is having a lot of fabs available so you build and disassemble buildings as you need to make something. You can fit a SKF in this way üòé

PG isn't even close to being cost effective yet, unfortunately


[29-Jun-24 06:12 PM] evany.#0000
as long as both production lines are operating at 100% i think then the argument is between your ability to haul it / move it vs the cost of BSE

I mean it's worse for $/day but I wouldn't be able to run my Norwick base at all without it


[29-Jun-24 06:13 PM] evany.#0000
since people fly around full WCB's for less than 10k even if demo/rebuild cost was only 1 bSE each 20 times thats like 20k ?


[29-Jun-24 06:13 PM] evany.#0000
i suppose if its really remote though


[29-Jun-24 06:14 PM] evany.#0000
i looked at doing  a HYF base

Prunplanner says it's a difference of like 200$/day

and MHL is nearly 1.2mil on CX for 1 base


[29-Jun-24 06:14 PM] tanda#0000
considering you wouldn't need to touch your habs at all, you could technically use rigs to get water, use water to grow plants and then run fps/inc to process it to its shippable form

[29-Jun-24 10:39 PM] evany.#0000
a bit more currently because of the new update and politics/governments were kind of re-done

not really, no. and when there is it's pretty inconsequential. it's essentially player-driven entertainment, really :P

dude honestly 

antman seems like the most useless super hero 
and the stupid arrow guy. idk


[29-Jun-24 10:43 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah no, like i said it was just burnout :/


[29-Jun-24 10:44 PM] jvaler#0000
ARROW GUY oh my god ikr


[29-Jun-24 10:44 PM] evany.#0000
i get that you need some 'normies' to make the other heroes look bad ass


[29-Jun-24 10:44 PM] tanda#0000
when australis left he was managing something like 20+ bases


[29-Jun-24 10:44 PM] jvaler#0000
but i think ant man has a cool power... the movie was just bad


[29-Jun-24 10:44 PM] tanda#0000
including a lot of logistic overhead

i should give them a try before shitting on it probably ;it just never seemed "ideal" to me yknow

there isn't much when it comes to toxicity, people here are rather helpful and will usually give you pointers towards efficency and some other stuff :D it's quite nice, and then us inefficent non-profitable people also have a space here too :3

i like to go for the long haul on things i play and so im just trying to work out whether or not this is something id invest time/money into


[29-Jun-24 10:47 PM] evany.#0000
honestly burn out is probably as close to winning in this game as you can probably get


[29-Jun-24 10:47 PM] evany.#0000
its an economic simulator


[29-Jun-24 10:48 PM] evany.#0000
frankly, a rather slow one - too


[29-Jun-24 10:48 PM] tanda#0000
that actually makes it better though


[29-Jun-24 10:48 PM] tanda#0000
leaves a lot of time for community building


[29-Jun-24 10:48 PM] evany.#0000
yeah and t hat's not a negative to be clear


[29-Jun-24 10:49 PM] evany.#0000
i mean it would be if your looking for some fast paced 20 minute battleroyale experience


[29-Jun-24 10:49 PM] jvaler#0000
there were 2 main factors to australis leaving afaik
* almost all of their bases were tied up in AA-style co-op projects, giving them little agency in their gameplay. this made everything they did just a chore to be completed
* they felt that they were "not cut out for organization" to run ADI (told to me in dms, idk if i should be airing that out here but...)


[29-Jun-24 10:49 PM] evany.#0000
but you probably didn't fall upon the game on google or something because you were googling 'adrenaline pumping spreadsheets'


[29-Jun-24 10:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
im somewhat 50/50 on the slowness of the game, on one hand i do like the idea of it being something that i can play occasionally here and there, but comes the question of do i get to the point where i want to do so many things at once but am limited by the timescale of the game


[29-Jun-24 10:50 PM] evany.#0000
it would probably be helpful if you shared what kind of game you play / what you are looking for and we can talk about what it is / isn't


[29-Jun-24 10:50 PM] avalock#0000
I find burnout is a lot more of a subjective thing in general, I don't think the games nature is very like.... burnout inducing its more like "if I treat something like a job its gonna become a job" always good in general to take a step back and remember why you enjoy something, and breaks in anything you do is generally a good work ethic


[29-Jun-24 10:51 PM] jvaler#0000
there's people around who have been playing for year(s). i'm coming up on 1 year played in 2 months myself.

you just need to be able to create your own motivation to play, the game won't provide it for you. it's got that sandbox kind of gameplay like minecraft, in a way


[29-Jun-24 10:51 PM] tanda#0000
honestly yes, you will. I have about 5 bases planned currently


[29-Jun-24 10:52 PM] tanda#0000
though in my case the issue is a matter of funds, not time


[29-Jun-24 10:52 PM] evany.#0000
i'd say it depends on how you treat it @avalock 

if you take it slow and try to keep 15 days + stock and only send out ships maybe every other weekend for resupply / sales.. then who needs to login everyday


[29-Jun-24 10:52 PM] evany.#0000
but hard to get to that level of stability early on.


[29-Jun-24 10:52 PM] jvaler#0000
(this is why AGP exists ^ :P)

#agp-information


[29-Jun-24 10:53 PM] tanda#0000
early burnout happens a lot, I think. Most people don't expect the game to be as slow as it is. AGP definitely saved this game for me I think


[29-Jun-24 10:53 PM] evany.#0000
i'd add that the game starts incredibly slowly

but it doesn't _stay_ that way depending on your ability and desire to scale


[29-Jun-24 10:53 PM] tanda#0000
I didn't join ADI until about 2 weeks in, and having that extra funding made a lot of difference


[29-Jun-24 10:53 PM] evany.#0000
if you scale to 10-20 bases you will be busy everyday osetting up trades with people, you selling / you buying - dispatching ships moving things around planning your next moves

don't be shy, how many hours do you put into prun a day


[29-Jun-24 10:54 PM] avalock#0000
Honestly the thing I enjoy out of this game is helping out team economies üòÜ so I'm happy I'm apart of #kevin-information


[29-Jun-24 10:55 PM] jvaler#0000
way less than i used to, i'm definitely feeling the chore side of things with all my AA commitments. but being able to provide AGP grants and #internal-offers goods gives me motivation.
i'd say maybe 30mins to an hour. most of my prun "gameplay" is keeping up with community discords lmfao

[30-Jun-24 09:58 PM] evany.#0000
yes and no


[30-Jun-24 09:58 PM] tanda#0000
I played the crap out of that during my deployment


[30-Jun-24 09:58 PM] evany.#0000
it really depends on what you do in EVE


[30-Jun-24 09:58 PM] tanda#0000
got one day off and I spent all of that 36 hours awake playing EVE

you can play it pretty casually and you can play it pretty no life


[30-Jun-24 09:58 PM] evany.#0000
you have to be really careful which path you set yourself down on


[30-Jun-24 09:59 PM] evany.#0000

but things like skill queues and such came in like 2009 and more offline friendly play in 2012


[30-Jun-24 09:59 PM] evany.#0000

[30-Jun-24 10:02 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I briefly played EVE for 300 hours and I don't even know where the hours came from


[30-Jun-24 10:02 PM] evany.#0000
they took away your ability to see your hours


[30-Jun-24 10:03 PM] evany.#0000
last i looked my pvp alt account had 32,000 hours


[30-Jun-24 10:03 PM] tanda#0000
"briefly" yes, that sounds about right for a brief play of EVE


[30-Jun-24 10:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I spent most my time doing exploration in wormholes and a nullsec area I found close by that was mostly barren of players


[30-Jun-24 10:03 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
wdym, in client ?


[30-Jun-24 10:04 PM] tanda#0000
back in my day, we didn't launch all these MMOs through steam


[30-Jun-24 10:04 PM] evany.#0000
people use to get access to their ingame hours by either the logging client (eve online troubleshooter) or the API, the API was replaced by a new system unlovingly dubbed "ESI" and the eve troubleshooter was removed


[30-Jun-24 10:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I wanted to play mostly to get into manufacturing but gave up


[30-Jun-24 10:06 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Then I found this game :)


[30-Jun-24 10:06 PM] evany.#0000
its hard to get into manufacturing as a sole practice in EVE


[30-Jun-24 10:07 PM] evany.#0000
a lot of the market is _bad_


[30-Jun-24 10:07 PM] evany.#0000
theres a plethora of players that turn 100mil of minerals into a 90mil ship


[30-Jun-24 10:07 PM] evany.#0000
so trying to be a straight indy bro is hard


[30-Jun-24 10:07 PM] tanda#0000
I used to make T2 drones back in the day. I adored it


[30-Jun-24 10:08 PM] evany.#0000
yeah there is still room in niches like that


[30-Jun-24 10:08 PM] tanda#0000
I sold a lot of them too, but T2 drones was my niche


[30-Jun-24 10:08 PM] evany.#0000
i make structures today


[30-Jun-24 10:08 PM] evany.#0000
but they largely aren't profitable either


[30-Jun-24 10:08 PM] evany.#0000
the only way to make a profit now is to let players fill your buy orders where you pay 30mil for a 100mil thing


[30-Jun-24 10:09 PM] evany.#0000
then i can turn 70 of those things i underpaid for into a structure


[30-Jun-24 10:09 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Where's the money then ?


[30-Jun-24 10:09 PM] evany.#0000
a lot of manufacturing is kind of 'broken'


[30-Jun-24 10:09 PM] tanda#0000
the only way to make a buck is to let others make it for you


[30-Jun-24 10:09 PM] tanda#0000
the profit starts when they undervalue their own labor


[30-Jun-24 10:10 PM] evany.#0000
its insanely profitable because i sell a 1billion dollar structure and only paid 350mil for the inputs


[30-Jun-24 10:10 PM] evany.#0000
if you make the inputs from raw minerals etc it would cost you 1.1 billion


[30-Jun-24 10:10 PM] evany.#0000
but someone kills someone else that happened to be carrying one of the inputs and he puts it up on the market and he just sells it because he has no idea the value


[30-Jun-24 10:11 PM] evany.#0000
only reason its profitable is because i'm not paying "market rate"


[30-Jun-24 10:11 PM] jvaler#0000
yay blood money


[30-Jun-24 10:12 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
This sounds like an Apple store operating a pawn shop for phone parts to use for making iPhones


[30-Jun-24 10:12 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Also unless inflation went wild while I wasn't looking, that's a bit of money to start


[30-Jun-24 10:13 PM] evany.#0000
the currency in eve is fucked


[30-Jun-24 10:13 PM] evany.#0000
i broke 2 trillion last year


[30-Jun-24 10:14 PM] evany.#0000
judging from xit fin charts i've seen people post


[30-Jun-24 10:14 PM] evany.#0000
its probably fair to s ay 2 trillion in eve is about 2billion in prun

asteros is like 30mil nowadays

[30-Jun-24 10:22 PM] evany.#0000
might not be a billionaire  but he's damn close


[30-Jun-24 10:22 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
PRUN might be slower to get there with the stance on automation


[30-Jun-24 10:22 PM] evany.#0000
i didnt know there was a stance on automation

You can't have a program run ships or sell stuff for you


[30-Jun-24 10:23 PM] evany.#0000
thats the same then


[30-Jun-24 10:23 PM] evany.#0000
i kind of just assumed that was the case


[30-Jun-24 10:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Kinda thought EVE was more lax with that


[30-Jun-24 10:23 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Or at least unenforced


[30-Jun-24 10:24 PM] evany.#0000
there was a brief period from probably '09-'11 where it was kind of ignored


[30-Jun-24 10:25 PM] evany.#0000
and even then the only reason they did shit about it is because people complained


[30-Jun-24 10:25 PM] evany.#0000
the difference is alts.. the average eve player nowadays has 5.5 accounts or some shit according to CCP


[30-Jun-24 10:26 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Average of 5.5 is wild


[30-Jun-24 10:26 PM] evany.#0000
obviously theres plenty of people with 1-2.. but that means theres just as many with 10+


[30-Jun-24 10:26 PM] evany.#0000
there was a year or two when i made super carriers and had 30 accounts


[30-Jun-24 10:26 PM] evany.#0000
im far more casual nowadays too


[30-Jun-24 10:28 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I didn't expect it to be that much. Does that affect player count numbers or did the devs figure that out ?


[30-Jun-24 10:28 PM] evany.#0000
naw thats player count


[30-Jun-24 10:29 PM] evany.#0000
despite the fact tranquility says theres 30k people logged in, in reality theres probably less than 10k


[30-Jun-24 10:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Reminds me of recent proof about how botted TF2's (Team Fortress, not Titanfall) player numbers are


[30-Jun-24 10:31 PM] evany.#0000
theres still some bots


[30-Jun-24 10:31 PM] evany.#0000
but honestly not many


[30-Jun-24 10:31 PM] evany.#0000
ironically the 'noob friendly pvp' is probably the most botted activity

[05-Jul-24 09:16 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Hey all. I am looking to maybe create a program... less a project. A loose organization that coordinates and produces Governor/planet upkeep material in Antares.

The primary goal is to have people create and provide materials to the CX, and direct contract when necessary, that planets and governors often use.

Materials include
-OFF (So need to source PG, EPO, CL, H, C, etc etc)
-DW (PG and H2O)
-SUN (C and OVE)
-TUB (GL)
-SOI
-HD
-POW

Specifically interested if anyone wants to take on a manufacturing bases, a chemistry base or 2, a EXT base, an electronics base, metallurgy, etc like that that would deal in these sorts of things


[05-Jul-24 09:18 PM] riseoffilth#0000
They dont have to be dedicated bases, but some portion of it to focus on making these products to supply market/governing folks


[05-Jul-24 09:20 PM] avalock#0000
willing to do Extraction


[05-Jul-24 09:21 PM] riseoffilth#0000
HAL, some MGS, maybe water if someone wants to commit to making DW? but i feel like existing market/projects makes that unnecessary


[05-Jul-24 09:21 PM] riseoffilth#0000
if making SOI, CLI and BRM are big ones


[05-Jul-24 09:24 PM] tanda#0000
I have plans to expand to the SE-110 system, so I could commit to doing FP's in there


[05-Jul-24 09:24 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
It was on the list of things to do (https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1246540231264567318/1254284905488318525) so I approve. Have a more detailed list of how much of each governing good you plan on making ?


[05-Jul-24 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
that is if the extraction point that you have in mind is ISA


[05-Jul-24 09:27 PM] helminsted#0000
i'll make DW and the other associated products that can be made with the facilities, sounds like a plan =]


[05-Jul-24 09:28 PM] avalock#0000
How would YK-266C be for BRM


[05-Jul-24 09:28 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Not at this point. Some of these items are completely not related to each other, which is why I was thinking of this in "loose" organizational sense. Maybe smaller groups within the whole that focus on 1 output. Not even with dedicated bases, just dedicating enough production


[05-Jul-24 09:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
2-3 people working together on one item


[05-Jul-24 09:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
or 1 person does it all


[05-Jul-24 09:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
but they pick a thing and they kick its ass


[05-Jul-24 09:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Sounds good. I find DW on the list a bit weird. Hard to call it a scarce good


[05-Jul-24 09:30 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
You think the price should be lower ?


[05-Jul-24 09:31 PM] helminsted#0000
lol i'd love to supplement the market with a DW to rival Aquafina


[05-Jul-24 09:35 PM] riseoffilth#0000
yeah im regretting it


[05-Jul-24 09:35 PM] riseoffilth#0000
it felt odd, but i threw it up there as a input


[05-Jul-24 09:35 PM] riseoffilth#0000
but you are right, it shouldnt be


[05-Jul-24 09:37 PM] helminsted#0000
ah ok, so if not DW, maybe just make fuel? i am specialized in that

[05-Jul-24 09:40 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Outside the projects, there's a bunch of other things you can make. Fuel making **IN** ANT is doable but there's other things that are easier, like construction of fabs and smelting

[06-Jul-24 12:38 PM] riseoffilth#0000
I think a better goal is to just create prices and relationships with a goal of a set production output/day


[06-Jul-24 12:51 PM] tanda#0000
more specifically, what would you be looking for as far as like POW? That seems relatively easy to turn out in significant quantities, with one base doing ~88 POW a day, but that's also not insanely profitable, as it looks like the cost of LI are bringing costs up for the recipe


[06-Jul-24 01:27 PM] riseoffilth#0000
tbf, my goal here isnt to create a insane profitability venture. Its to look at moderate profitability, at reasonable rates, for whatever is needed. I'm going through and looking at numbers now and making sheets


[06-Jul-24 01:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
The idea here is to help the region as a whole. You can list any price on market. I'm more directly looking to merely have an offering that governors (and lord knows I dont want "governors" to be me forever) to have a market to make buy things at not crazy manipulated prices. Though if we can make it competetive and still darn profitable on market, that is a good thing too


[06-Jul-24 01:29 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Thats why i dont think this needs to be a huge venture


[06-Jul-24 01:30 PM] tanda#0000

at the end of the day tho, most these bases will be occpuied by others, i just want to sponsor it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è people can do whatever, but I hope they join me in wanting to create better supply for our region to enable anyone to contribute to governing by engaging with these suppliers.

For what it's worth, I've recently started to make both TUB and OFF. I'm using a little myself, with most is either being sold to governors direct, or if no takers, being sold into the CX. Good initiative though, some of those supplies are a little thin to get ahold of via the CX, so more supply will make it easier to governer and drive the prices down to gov planets.

If you are focused on profit, just run 10 CHP bases refining CL/NA, it‚Äôs most profit


[07-Jul-24 02:05 AM] riseoffilth#0000
The point is to make a final product, not fight with your own supplier against the CX

I will currently focus on profits given my company age, just don't over-advertise your program to newer players please


[07-Jul-24 02:05 AM] razenpok#0000

[07-Jul-24 02:06 AM] razenpok#0000
While yes, more established players are welcome to do whatever is best for the region


[07-Jul-24 02:06 AM] riseoffilth#0000
Considering I‚Äôm loaning people the materials for a free base, it seems like an opportunity to make money immediately that they wouldn‚Äôt have made. That‚Äôs the definition of growth


[07-Jul-24 02:07 AM] razenpok#0000
You are _loaning_ money. If we are talking reduced profits (my point this whole topic), they will repay this loan very ineffectively


[07-Jul-24 02:08 AM] riseoffilth#0000
And even then, what I posted above are suggested prices. Discussions can happen to find a suitable middle ground to address pricing concerns


[07-Jul-24 02:09 AM] razenpok#0000
Unless you loan it for an indefinite amount of time, then there's another issue: it will take away some of the logistics capacity from them (which is not very great with 500/500)


[07-Jul-24 02:09 AM] razenpok#0000
I'm concerned specifically about newer players rn

I remember being stressed over 15k losses at one point


[07-Jul-24 02:12 AM] razenpok#0000
I mean, I would lose interest in the game if I needed to work to pay off my loan for 30 days straight and not do anything else in the game


[07-Jul-24 02:18 AM] riseoffilth#0000
You‚Äôre making significant assumptions‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm not sure why. 

1. Every loan I make is basically indefinite. I don‚Äôt do contract loans, I don‚Äôt set hard time frames. I set no time frames.
2. I like helping new players, and giving them bases for free with a 1 in 3 chance they pay back, to me, is worth it for the outcome of helping them, and creating a production line for things I and others will use. 
3. I‚Äôve done this for years, and it‚Äôs how the guy that literally made this server got his first bases. And the person who runs it now also got some of their first bases from me.
4. Any logistics problem is trivial. I give out ships too


[07-Jul-24 02:19 AM] riseoffilth#0000

Isn't it better to set standard ROI for everyone involve in the project? For my own spreadsheet when I'm doing vertical I always have "add cost/h" to those machine when accepting project. I assume that many player with 100 days+ have their own spread sheet.

Me personally like these activity to improve the community. but that's the passion. strong communities contribute to self-interest and public should have standard in providing these activities.


[07-Jul-24 02:59 AM] rogue48.#0000
In column K:L project leader "must/should" assign mutual ROI commitment to reach the advantage along with project goal. when we develop together capital in investment isn't that big problem

With projects that have a typical payout system, all profits tend to be the same, minus the specific upkeeps of the base, so that everything is offset to give an equal profit to everyone involved. Not sure if that's how it'll be intended for this one, but in general, the ROI can fluctuate massively depending on base, that's just how it goes.

i go tru your discussion a bit, and the OFF chain seems very interesting to me, with enough leeway on both BMP and CHP bases to make sth else, 
the main bottleneck would still be the logistic required in shipping concern, 

I'd be very interesting in details if you can solve the shipping concern, and mind that i wont be able to repay you in a timely manner (or if at all), but provide that i almost got thru my malahat rental, i think i could stick around to atleast get some decent amount of OFF flowing around ANT

[10-Jul-24 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
so these are the top dogs in 6 jumps of ANT


[10-Jul-24 09:20 PM] tanda#0000
so it really is IY816c and YK590c


[10-Jul-24 09:22 PM] jcheung#0000
yesh. 590 with cocg extraction is just barely better than 816 without


[10-Jul-24 09:25 PM] tanda#0000
so it looks like the best option is to do more permits on Nascent


[10-Jul-24 09:26 PM] jcheung#0000
ü§î debatable


[10-Jul-24 09:26 PM] tanda#0000
one extra permit takes ALO from 654 per day to 1028 per day, an increase of 374


[10-Jul-24 09:26 PM] tanda#0000
with the same level of shipment as current


[10-Jul-24 09:27 PM] tanda#0000
@avalock how many WCBs do you have currently?


[10-Jul-24 09:27 PM] jcheung#0000
590 with cocg extraction is +538


[10-Jul-24 09:28 PM] avalock#0000
1 awa


[10-Jul-24 09:28 PM] jcheung#0000
the question is, is upkeeping the planet worth ~~200~~ 150 ALO üòÇ


[10-Jul-24 09:29 PM] tanda#0000
money wise, Nascent only makes 15k less per day due to one planet taking HSE and the other INS and SEA


[10-Jul-24 09:29 PM] avalock#0000
tbf, I'm not fully producing at nascent yet


[10-Jul-24 09:29 PM] avalock#0000
so I just need to add more extractors


[10-Jul-24 09:29 PM] avalock#0000
I was a bit busy with some other shtuff


[10-Jul-24 09:30 PM] tanda#0000
then expanding that production line is the easy decision


[10-Jul-24 09:30 PM] avalock#0000
Yeeeeee


[11-Jul-24 02:00 PM] riseoffilth#0000
If anyone in Antares is interested, with the help of another new friend, we now have access to 300+/day GAL. This may be of particular interest for anyone looking into local SF production.


[11-Jul-24 02:01 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Also, RE- my previous Gov materials ‚Äúproject‚Äù, I‚Äôm going to be spinning up PFE production within the next week

Still looking for someone to produce AMM (just a single gas giant base), glass production on WU-070a, and a manufacturing base on Astraeus


[11-Jul-24 02:03 PM] riseoffilth#0000

A friend of mine who just started the other day picked Fuel Engineer on Phobos, unsure if that could be of any assistance. Though we're free licenses since our taste of the game is rather early still

Although they were less established when they began and so they didn't have the pull to provide the same level of grants.


[11-Jul-24 11:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
It typically ended up being cheap materials or loans instead of straight up cash.

And/or ALO base on Nascent, on the condition that pickup will be there, since I've got no WCB


[13-Jul-24 08:25 AM] evany.#0000
i think avacyn might have scaled up a bit

What do you do for 3000/3+4


[19-Jul-24 04:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
3000 enter 3 / 4 +


[19-Jul-24 04:11 PM] sidepipe#0000
assuming you mean (3000/4) + 4 üòÑ


[19-Jul-24 04:12 PM] razenpok#0000

[19-Jul-24 04:12 PM] razenpok#0000
(+ (/ 3000 3) 4)


[19-Jul-24 04:13 PM] igfloz#0000
thats just foreign to me, doesn't even look like math lol


[19-Jul-24 04:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
imagine + as a function


[19-Jul-24 04:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
(+, number 1, number 2)


[19-Jul-24 04:13 PM] sidepipe#0000
so you prefix the operator instead of infixing it

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[19-Jul-24 04:14 PM] jcheung#0000
I don't like either of those


[19-Jul-24 04:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
and RPN is kinda like postfixing


[19-Jul-24 04:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
so youd say 3 4 +


[19-Jul-24 04:15 PM] sidepipe#0000
but in the above the calculator has a stack so you push numbers onto it with enter


[19-Jul-24 04:15 PM] razenpok#0000
I feel like RPN is too much mental overhead


[19-Jul-24 04:15 PM] razenpok#0000
Too much stacking


[19-Jul-24 04:16 PM] sidepipe#0000
i like the stacks üôÇ


[19-Jul-24 04:16 PM] razenpok#0000
Like you would need to actually write down the exact sequence prior to running the calc

nah, not once you get used to it


[19-Jul-24 04:17 PM] razenpok#0000

That's plain nightmare


[19-Jul-24 04:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
it's much less mental overhead than you'd think when you're working with a calculator


[19-Jul-24 04:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
though for programming, I totally agree


[19-Jul-24 04:18 PM] razenpok#0000
Ok, fair

[19-Jul-24 04:24 PM] razenpok#0000

I love F#, it's super cool


[19-Jul-24 04:35 PM] evany.#0000
i've never actually touched f#. what would you use it for ?


[19-Jul-24 04:36 PM] evany.#0000
im primarily networking focused so python netmiko some basic api shit. aka really bad programmer


[19-Jul-24 04:36 PM] razenpok#0000
It's perfect for business/domain rules in an app


[19-Jul-24 04:37 PM] razenpok#0000
I'm an app developer, and using general-purpose languages (java/c#) for business rules is a bit eh


[19-Jul-24 04:37 PM] razenpok#0000
On the other hand, programming anything else in f# would be a pain the ass

Here, a very short primer on its usefulness


[19-Jul-24 04:41 PM] razenpok#0000
I would die for the pipe opertator (|>) in every other language


[19-Jul-24 04:43 PM] razenpok#0000
So, instead of
```js
var arr = [1..100];
var sum = List.sum(arr);
printfn("sum=%d", sum)
```
You would do
```fsharp
[1..100] |> List.sum |> printfn "sum=%d"
```


[19-Jul-24 04:43 PM] sidepipe#0000
You'd like R then üôÇ


[19-Jul-24 04:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
with all the tidyverse packages etc - you get a very similar syntax for piping between functions

@jvaler I tell you what I told them as they are going back to school. This moment and point in your life is utterly unique to every year that comes after it. Your entire life are open doors and many paths, and this is the most influence years of your life when choosing that path. Make sure you choose a path that you are passionate about and brings you joy. And if you cant do or find that, do something that makes money, so you can find your passion later and be able to afford it! But dont forget to enjoy this youth and moment, because it will never happen again.

how much water do you need for your needs?


[20-Jul-24 01:10 PM] evany.#0000
State 1 of the plan is to fill my pool


[20-Jul-24 01:10 PM] evany.#0000
About 400 a day


[20-Jul-24 01:10 PM] evany.#0000
Stage 2 of my plan, more like 1100


[20-Jul-24 01:10 PM] evany.#0000
I also have a quite gracious opportunity for you my friend


[20-Jul-24 01:11 PM] evany.#0000
In several hours I will gain the ability to pick up the water myself


[20-Jul-24 01:11 PM] evany.#0000

I'll have to check prunplanner to see if I can support that

but even if I can't, I could sell you a good bit of water to get started

I'm not sure that's legal.


[20-Jul-24 01:13 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Jul-24 01:19 PM] evany.#0000
i came into it pretty half cocked so let me find real numbers too


[20-Jul-24 01:21 PM] evany.#0000
stage1 is 300 not 400


[20-Jul-24 01:21 PM] evany.#0000
and stage 2 is 1200, not 1100


[20-Jul-24 01:21 PM] evany.#0000
so i need water for like six pools. a day.


[20-Jul-24 01:45 PM] sidepipe#0000

By the way. Would anyone have a setup for an agriculture to carbon base?


[22-Jul-24 02:11 PM] igfloz#0000
So... this is a GRN Farm on Harmonia (benefit from Agriculture CoGC ) - I'd advise the Carbon part of your venture would be on another planet with a suitable CoGC, Errrrr. Nascent ? Maybe ?

[22-Jul-24 02:24 PM] skyrey#0000
Intriguing


[22-Jul-24 02:28 PM] skyrey#0000
Although I still have a feeling that I want to include incinerators on Harmonia. Would transporting grain not take up a lot of shipping capacity?


[22-Jul-24 02:30 PM] igfloz#0000
you can get 500 GRN on a starter ship


[22-Jul-24 02:33 PM] igfloz#0000
so... if you look at the factory I posted, with full 5 experts you get 28.4% production bonus (CoGC Agriculture) - If you put incinerators on Harmonia you don't get any bonus for them. Nascent gives the correct CoGC bonus (Resource Extraction)


[22-Jul-24 02:35 PM] skyrey#0000
Yep. Meaning that overall it will be more time efficient. I also did some quick math and 13 farmsteads do not produce 500 grain as quickly as I thought


[22-Jul-24 02:36 PM] skyrey#0000
It will be worth it. Although I should probably first move the PE production to Hephaestus


[22-Jul-24 02:37 PM] igfloz#0000
startup (full 13 FRM) will obviously be slower, but I assure you within a few days, you will get 3 experts, 4 & 5 expert takes some time


[22-Jul-24 02:37 PM] igfloz#0000
The more production going on for a base = quickest expert generation


[22-Jul-24 02:37 PM] skyrey#0000
Already on the 3rd agriculture expert


[22-Jul-24 02:37 PM] igfloz#0000
nice


[22-Jul-24 02:38 PM] skyrey#0000
Okey, I will be slowly moving everything that is not agriculture off Harmonia


[22-Jul-24 02:39 PM] igfloz#0000
Hephaestus is a good choice for a central (not necessarily HQ) base, very close to ANT CX


[22-Jul-24 02:44 PM] skyrey#0000
Another question. Should I shift from PE to metallurgy? Such as gold


[22-Jul-24 02:44 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Metallurgy without a bigger cargo hold is rough


[22-Jul-24 02:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
And usually not crazy profitable


[22-Jul-24 02:45 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
PE is actually quite good if all you care about is money per day


[22-Jul-24 02:46 PM] skyrey#0000
Noted. Is there a point in going further in the production chain then PE, or just focus on making as much of it as possible?


[22-Jul-24 02:47 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I'd just try going into prunplanner and plugging in a couple options


[22-Jul-24 02:47 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I know that BDE is best made with PE but whether it's a better option than selling raw PE depends


[22-Jul-24 02:48 PM] skyrey#0000
Perhaps OVEs?


[22-Jul-24 02:49 PM] igfloz#0000
I may be wrong here, but if you look into producing items that are further down the production chain, I'm guessing the material import will be way expensive


[22-Jul-24 02:49 PM] skyrey#0000
I can grow RCO on a different agricultural planet nearby


[22-Jul-24 02:49 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Try planning an OVE base in prunplanner


[22-Jul-24 02:50 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
I have my doubts because I can buy 100 OVE for a base and forget about it for a long time


[22-Jul-24 02:51 PM] skyrey#0000
I will experiment with the pruner


[22-Jul-24 02:52 PM] igfloz#0000
.....also, maybe  look into planning a raw material source planet to feed your hephaestus base. I make OVE on Heph and I will say that if you look at the chart for OVE, it's not really a daily sale item


[22-Jul-24 02:52 PM] igfloz#0000
..not that I'm talking you out of competing with me, lol - Its only a small base for me


[22-Jul-24 02:53 PM] skyrey#0000
I will take a few expansion options into account

@skyrey Here's a limited selection of beginner materials and rough estimation of money/day of a dedicated base at 100%. There are more profitable options and some mats are best produced together with others as to not overwhelm the demand but I hope this might help a bit

[22-Jul-24 03:33 PM] skyrey#0000
I am currently looking at a few setup ideas I have. I am thinking of converting my Harmonia base to just grow GRN until I setup a Carbon and PE bases respectively. Do you think that I can get away with surviving on just selling GRN to the Anteras CX?


[22-Jul-24 03:34 PM] igfloz#0000
There are people who will buy it. I feed into one C project, I'm sure you will find buyers.


[22-Jul-24 03:35 PM] jcheung#0000
i personally feel like RAT is way complicated for new


[22-Jul-24 03:35 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
There's a person with a massive buy order on the CX. It probably won't be much $$$ but survivable


[22-Jul-24 03:35 PM] jcheung#0000
if i had to guess without looking, feedstock prices probably shot up


[22-Jul-24 03:37 PM] skyrey#0000
Then I think that I will close my Carbon and PE production on Harmonia and make a permanent GRN setup


[22-Jul-24 03:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You had that all on Harmonia?


[22-Jul-24 03:38 PM] skyrey#0000
Yep, I started a bit more then 3 weeks ago


[22-Jul-24 03:38 PM] histidinedwarf#0000
Looking at CXPC, the average price of GRN went up by like 10-20. You could probably buy a kinder egg with the difference


[22-Jul-24 03:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Gotcha!


[22-Jul-24 03:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can buy your GRN or HCP if you want


[22-Jul-24 03:38 PM] igfloz#0000
It's worth mentioning that there are some people looking at multiple C  plant feeds, some look to GRN + HCP input........

So my point was I won‚Äôt sell them to the CX üòÖ


[22-Jul-24 03:48 PM] skyrey#0000
Hahaha, that was quick. I will be able to afford finishing the base with what I got so far, I want to finish my month of playing relatively slowly. Not to get overwhelmed right away 

Although I am up to join the Kevin program and get a 0% loan to resume PE production, in a week

[22-Jul-24 04:24 PM] marat_sh#0000
any plans on having manufacturing COGC on any Antares III (near Nike) planets in the future?


[22-Jul-24 04:31 PM] jvaler#0000
probably agri market fluctuations, they're pretty volatile due to their low throughput


[22-Jul-24 04:32 PM] jvaler#0000
static agri pricing could probably be helpful there, given most people choose to make their own agri


[22-Jul-24 05:49 PM] jcheung#0000

I'm surprised there's not more given the rivalry but I guess either people don't care THAT much or the fact there's not really many planets in Antares that are inhabited and also aren't named already.


[23-Jul-24 01:39 PM] igfloz#0000
I hadn't even considered that there was rivalry between areas...... I mean I'm pretty much flying in ant space, so I guess I don't see it

a heart beat, agreement to loan, and other fun things. Basically just some input/output price controls, sale me some of your materials... The goal is to help newbros, but also create suppliers for my larger industries or goals of influencing markets that I think are a bit too wild

Yea I‚Äôd be up for that, plus I like the sound of a 2k2k loan if that comes with it.  I‚Äôm guessing as part of it, I‚Äôd buy the base Mats from you and then sell the PG back?

let me see if i still have the plans

I definitely looked at what it takes to do WCBs, and quickly realized it's a huge task, lol


[25-Jul-24 10:29 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. so it's pretty rough, but still doable imo. 2 ASM making FET, 2 HWP making AHP and 12 SMEs for support.
output roughly 12.7 AHP (slight variation because under-supply FET by 10%), plus a little bit of SME output. profit/d ~50k
even has room to swap a SME for a GF. or 3 SMEs for 2 GFs.


[25-Jul-24 10:29 PM] jcheung#0000
it might have been one of my earlier plans, but 2m build cost was way out of my price range


[25-Jul-24 10:30 PM] jcheung#0000
i think the profit margin was worse when i originally drafted it though, like 30k or something

i would say everyday roughly just want to make sure not wasting fuel and shit


[27-Jul-24 03:52 PM] xtc69#0000
to market


[27-Jul-24 03:52 PM] marat_sh#0000
how much fuel 1 trip back and forth takes


[27-Jul-24 03:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
for me it's around 200 units there and back


[27-Jul-24 03:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
under 10 hours


[27-Jul-24 03:54 PM] xtc69#0000

[27-Jul-24 03:55 PM] marat_sh#0000
sounds reasonable


[27-Jul-24 03:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
the price for fuel is around 15.5 per unit


[27-Jul-24 03:56 PM] marat_sh#0000
78 * 15.5 = $1500 for one way trip


[27-Jul-24 03:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
try to load as much as you can before you send but also concider the time to travel


[27-Jul-24 03:58 PM] marat_sh#0000
is it really that fuel efficient? damn I though being that close to ANT helps


[27-Jul-24 04:02 PM] jcheung#0000
I learned the hard way that sometimes jumping between systems is cheaper than in system


[27-Jul-24 04:02 PM] jcheung#0000
More damage though, sometimes


[27-Jul-24 04:02 PM] jcheung#0000
...usually


[27-Jul-24 04:02 PM] jcheung#0000
Can even  jump out, abort jump in, use less fuel and get there faster


[27-Jul-24 04:04 PM] marat_sh#0000
Good to know \


[27-Jul-24 04:11 PM] xtc69#0000
what you mean abort thats weird lol


[27-Jul-24 04:16 PM] jcheung#0000
Basically jump to next system but skip going to a planet, then jump back into the previous system


[27-Jul-24 05:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
You can cancel a flight path in the middle of the path. It finishes the current segment and then stops


[27-Jul-24 05:04 PM] archielvahr#0000
which can stop you in orbit around a planet or waiting somewhere random.


[27-Jul-24 05:55 PM] xtc69#0000
so like this i would abort this now ? kinda confused lol

[27-Jul-24 06:00 PM] archielvahr#0000
Ah the abort trick is really only helpful for in-system flights. Don't abort that unless you made a mistake and don't actually want to go to Deimos


[27-Jul-24 06:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
It's for situations like this:

[27-Jul-24 06:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
I want to go from ANT to ZV-307h. It's an all-in-one-system flight. But it's 233 units of fuel and takes 25 hours.


[27-Jul-24 06:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I'd jump out of system, cancel, jump back in. Then it's probably about 61 SF fuel and like 20 FF


[27-Jul-24 06:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
and maybe like 6 hours instead


[27-Jul-24 06:08 PM] xtc69#0000
aww i see


[27-Jul-24 06:08 PM] xtc69#0000
where is say +1 day that means 2 day trip


[27-Jul-24 06:12 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
You've got a contract from me for 6000 PG on ANT. Do you think you could get that there in 2-3hrs?


[27-Jul-24 06:13 PM] spermatozoon_saloon#0000
CONT ID LYK2SCS


[27-Jul-24 07:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
That duration thing is part of PMMG


[27-Jul-24 07:01 PM] archielvahr#0000
a browser plugin that adds a lot of essential features


[29-Jul-24 05:10 PM] revoric#0000
so i started yesterday on demios as a miner. not sure what im doing but have my first resuply ariving in 4 hours üòõ


[29-Jul-24 05:24 PM] jcheung#0000
well, you can start by saying what you've done since starting, and what you have in the way of plans üòÑ


[29-Jul-24 05:30 PM] revoric#0000
oh i see, well i have a smelter and extractor, smelted some of the iron ore i started with and bought some rations and building mats to increese production, i cant grab a license till thursday so im doing what i can with limited acess lol


[29-Jul-24 05:30 PM] revoric#0000
i also grabed a warehouse at ANT figured that would be smart


[29-Jul-24 05:31 PM] jcheung#0000
have you heard of prunplanner or pmmg?


[29-Jul-24 05:31 PM] jcheung#0000
actually i guess the question is, are you browser or steam


[29-Jul-24 05:32 PM] revoric#0000
have pmmg its amazing, keeping me here more then lastime and i cant figure out prunplanner tbh, i couldnt find how to "plan" anything after 30 min


[29-Jul-24 05:33 PM] revoric#0000
thinking about building a gas extractor so i have oxygen i dont have to fly for


[29-Jul-24 05:35 PM] jcheung#0000
i don't recommend a COL on deimos


[29-Jul-24 05:35 PM] jcheung#0000
like it's not the absolute worst place to place one


[29-Jul-24 05:35 PM] revoric#0000
oh? is a third of a bar "not great"


[29-Jul-24 05:36 PM] jcheung#0000
well, it's because of your other options you see


[29-Jul-24 05:36 PM] jcheung#0000
hang on let me


[29-Jul-24 05:43 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. looking at just the building land area used, EXT would make roughly 10% more than what COLs would make


[29-Jul-24 05:43 PM] jcheung#0000
if you were to sell to CX


[29-Jul-24 05:44 PM] revoric#0000
like raw oxygen selling vs raw alu selling instead of smelting?


[29-Jul-24 05:44 PM] jcheung#0000
your consumption of worker consumables would also be slightly lowered, but didn't run the numbers on that


[29-Jul-24 05:44 PM] jcheung#0000
yes, or if you're smelting then it would be what you would save from buying O vs selling excess ALO


[29-Jul-24 05:45 PM] jcheung#0000
although, 10% is a lot closer than i initially thought


[29-Jul-24 05:45 PM] jcheung#0000
i thought the gap was larger


[29-Jul-24 05:46 PM] revoric#0000
and if i twiddle my thumbs till i have a full cargo then its even better on fuel cost. i have the terrible habit of activly playing idle games lol


[29-Jul-24 05:46 PM] jcheung#0000
here's my thoughts on that part


[29-Jul-24 05:47 PM] jcheung#0000
if you produce both O and ALO on deimos, what do you carry on the return trip?


[29-Jul-24 05:47 PM] jcheung#0000
if you buy your O, you bring O in each time you sell AL


[29-Jul-24 05:47 PM] revoric#0000
carbon i still need to trip for the short term


[29-Jul-24 05:47 PM] revoric#0000
atleast untill i get the license to buy from the local market or contracts


[29-Jul-24 05:49 PM] jcheung#0000
honestly even with pro you'll likely still get C from ANT, most of the time


[29-Jul-24 05:50 PM] revoric#0000
fair, that saying i just realised i forgot C on my latest and first shipment XD


[29-Jul-24 05:50 PM] jcheung#0000
you'll probably also want FLX


[29-Jul-24 05:50 PM] jcheung#0000
maybe


[29-Jul-24 05:51 PM] revoric#0000
if its cheap then al then prolly


[29-Jul-24 05:53 PM] revoric#0000
155  726 on alu so ill pick some up


[29-Jul-24 05:55 PM] revoric#0000
make my last carbon go further


[29-Jul-24 06:00 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. so what i did here was run up a couple designs in prunplanner (maybe can walk you through how to use it in a bit) with a couple little disclaimers.
my CX price settings are set to worse case
CX prices are fluid, so profit margins may differ from day to day

img 1) 2 COL 5 EXT 11 SME, 39,191 profit/d; balanced to minimize imports with 3/3 expert split between metallurgy/resource extraction.
img 2) 6 EXT, 12 SME, drop one STO (bit iffy on this one), 43,786 profit/d; balanced to minimize imports with 4/2 expert split between metallurgy/resource extraction.
img 3) full send SME, 60,627 profit. importing more than one shipload a day in feedstock. feels shocks from CX a lot. 5 metallurgy experts

[29-Jul-24 06:02 PM] revoric#0000
i see thats powerfull tool knowing how to use it


[29-Jul-24 06:03 PM] jcheung#0000
there's a few things at play here... and some tradeoffs
1) ALO is simply more valuable than O, which is why 1 and 2 have a difference
2) both EXT and COL do not match the COCG of deimos, so they don't get a very large boost to their work speed, which means that your workforce consumables per unit produced is higher, and your output per day is lower
3) if you eliminate both, it comes with a large downside of your current logistics being nearly saturated
4) if you go pure SME, or even rely on CX more for feed, you're more at the whim of the CX pricing for feed


[29-Jul-24 06:05 PM] jcheung#0000
now, additional disclaimer


[29-Jul-24 06:06 PM] jcheung#0000
i'm also only like a month and some change in, so do not rely on everything i say


[29-Jul-24 06:06 PM] revoric#0000
i mean eveything you have said makes sence, i apreciate the knowlage


[29-Jul-24 06:07 PM] jcheung#0000
now depending on how long you plan on remaining free


[29-Jul-24 06:07 PM] revoric#0000
till thursday lol


[29-Jul-24 06:07 PM] jcheung#0000
oh, okay. well then never mind üòÑ


[29-Jul-24 06:08 PM] revoric#0000
broke my toe and work wont let me in till i can put on a shoe so im broke, romate gets paid thursday lol

üòÖ 

[29-Jul-24 06:08 PM] jcheung#0000
i was about to give advice that would have some people raising their pitchforks and torches if you were planning on longer


[29-Jul-24 06:08 PM] revoric#0000
XD, lets hear it anyway just to incide violence


[29-Jul-24 06:12 PM] jcheung#0000
basically, you really want to match COGC (you might notice me spell this differently repeatedly, because i can't ever freakin remember the order of it) of the planet if you're able to, but there are some cases where you can break that if you have good reason to... like, for example, those EXTs and COLs you were looking at-it reduces your logistical tail, by a lot sometimes.
if you remain free, it may be worth considering temporarily placing some additional stuff that doesn't match COGC like a PP2 which makes parts you need for construction. if you pick the right pieces to make, you can save more than what other buildings can make-but it'll be very dependant on CX costs for some things


[29-Jul-24 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
aaand i just realized the profit numbers are skewed high on this because dummy forgot to reset a custom override for ALO buy price. oops.


[29-Jul-24 06:13 PM] revoric#0000
i tend to play very vertical when it comes to mmo games like this, in starbase i slingshot myself to a moon 34 hours away to do my "own" thing XD


[29-Jul-24 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
ratios should still be similar though


[29-Jul-24 06:14 PM] jcheung#0000
vertical is good, but make sure you don't put the cart before the horse


[29-Jul-24 06:14 PM] revoric#0000
i apreaciate all this information. naturally dont want to break myself


[29-Jul-24 06:14 PM] jcheung#0000
especially early stage


[29-Jul-24 06:15 PM] revoric#0000
i wont be to hurt if i softlock myself once or twice. but would prefer to not. i would love to make it to making colonys on some grey planets.


[29-Jul-24 06:15 PM] jcheung#0000
also if you have a good plan forward, you can also apply for a grant to get a kickstart in #agp-information 
i would reserve about a quarter of the grant for consumables and unexpected expenses... and hold that for a couple days to a week


[29-Jul-24 06:16 PM] revoric#0000
makes sence


[29-Jul-24 06:16 PM] jcheung#0000
i, uh, may have dug myself into a bit of a hole while using grant + other loans and needed more loans to dig out because i hit unexpected costs üòÑ


[29-Jul-24 06:16 PM] revoric#0000
it happens!


[29-Jul-24 06:16 PM] jcheung#0000
as it turns out, planning to spend down to your last 5,000 credits isn't a very wise thing ü§î


[29-Jul-24 06:17 PM] revoric#0000
yeah im already in the same boat, but no loans yet lol


[29-Jul-24 06:20 PM] jcheung#0000
if you're currently stuck, i can bump you a little bit


[29-Jul-24 06:27 PM] revoric#0000
i wouldnt say no to it if its possible , though i *could* wait for my EXT to make alo for a week.


[29-Jul-24 06:28 PM] jcheung#0000
how much money do you have currently, and what's got you stuck


[29-Jul-24 06:31 PM] revoric#0000
2226 i spent too much on building suppies before carbon, so i have 10 carbon and some flux on the way from ant to smelt some more. really just carbon and oxygen to make use of my one smelter currently. im less stuck and more waiting for small batch things, though im probably loosing fuel. the faction contracts have me with a safe surplus and im burning slow.


[29-Jul-24 06:32 PM] jcheung#0000
you have anything at ANT currently, commodity wise


[29-Jul-24 06:32 PM] jcheung#0000
even if it's the C you just bought


[29-Jul-24 06:34 PM] revoric#0000
eveythings in flight and my ant warehouse is empty. üòõ


[29-Jul-24 06:34 PM] jcheung#0000
how about ship, are they both in flight/not at ANT?


[29-Jul-24 06:34 PM] revoric#0000
yes


[29-Jul-24 06:34 PM] revoric#0000
one inflight to ant the other comming from lol


[29-Jul-24 06:35 PM] jcheung#0000
*grumble*


[29-Jul-24 06:35 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, here's what we'r going to do then


[29-Jul-24 06:35 PM] revoric#0000
some raw ore and stuff to sell


[29-Jul-24 06:35 PM] jcheung#0000
we're going to launder some GL


[29-Jul-24 06:35 PM] revoric#0000
sounds fun


[29-Jul-24 06:36 PM] jcheung#0000
okay. i want you to open a couple of buffers


[29-Jul-24 06:37 PM] jcheung#0000
CXOB GL.AI1
CXPO GL.AI1 x2


[29-Jul-24 06:38 PM] jcheung#0000
in one CXPO buffer, i want you to place an order for the most GL you can afford, which should be... 272/u


[29-Jul-24 06:39 PM] jcheung#0000
in the second, set the price to 379/u and hang out.


[29-Jul-24 06:39 PM] jcheung#0000
the CXOB is for you to look to see when your order is removed so you can cycle to the next


[29-Jul-24 06:39 PM] revoric#0000
so buy 8 then sell for 379


[29-Jul-24 06:40 PM] jcheung#0000
yep. this number will climb each cycle


[29-Jul-24 06:40 PM] revoric#0000
i see


[29-Jul-24 06:43 PM] revoric#0000
you got me to 10k üôÇ


[29-Jul-24 06:43 PM] jcheung#0000
we're gonna go a little more


[29-Jul-24 06:43 PM] revoric#0000
ok


[29-Jul-24 06:43 PM] jcheung#0000
say... eh. 20k total?


[29-Jul-24 06:44 PM] revoric#0000
that would pay for my previous bad decisions ‚ù§Ô∏è


[29-Jul-24 06:45 PM] jcheung#0000
basically. i can't do this all the time but a quick bump to get you going at the start will make it more enjoyable for you (probably)


[29-Jul-24 06:45 PM] revoric#0000
i already love this game, just hvae to make it though the grind and traps


[29-Jul-24 06:45 PM] revoric#0000
20k has arrived


[29-Jul-24 06:46 PM] revoric#0000
close enough atleast lol i apriciate you!


[29-Jul-24 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000
i was about to say i thought you were at 16k


[29-Jul-24 06:46 PM] jcheung#0000
üòõ


[29-Jul-24 06:46 PM] revoric#0000
19 now


[29-Jul-24 06:46 PM] revoric#0000
19.7 lol


[29-Jul-24 06:46 PM] revoric#0000
any more and we would have overshot

on Deimos


[29-Jul-24 07:29 PM] finestone#0000
The farm/Inc is not necassry but they wanted to make thier own carbon


[29-Jul-24 07:30 PM] revoric#0000
its a smart thing to do, it costs almost as much as one AL


[29-Jul-24 07:30 PM] finestone#0000
Yes but 1 carbon makes 4 AL


[29-Jul-24 07:33 PM] finestone#0000
Also 1 Col is fine for O but no Rigs buying water is much cheaper on market for the oppurtunity cost.


[29-Jul-24 07:34 PM] jcheung#0000
üò¨  no STO eh?


[29-Jul-24 07:35 PM] finestone#0000
on deimos? nah you are close to market and can just rent from warehouse?


[29-Jul-24 07:39 PM] jcheung#0000
so here's what i would do to slightly optimize things, personally...
https://prunplanner.org/shared/ed255c3c-886c-43c0-a164-6bb8b5ca6b15


add a STO
drop the COL
add one EXT
drop one FRM
drop two INC
add two SME
drop one metallurgy expert
add one resource extraction expert


[29-Jul-24 07:40 PM] finestone#0000
^this is good though again no STO


[29-Jul-24 07:40 PM] jcheung#0000
or if you want to really ride things close and not have a STO, replace STO with another SME


[29-Jul-24 07:40 PM] finestone#0000
just rent 3 warehouse space


[29-Jul-24 07:40 PM] finestone#0000
and you will have plenty of storage


[29-Jul-24 07:40 PM] jcheung#0000
heh


[29-Jul-24 07:42 PM] finestone#0000
why would you have him spend almost 30k as a new player when he could spend 300 a week


[29-Jul-24 07:43 PM] finestone#0000
if you are on a planet with 1 warehouse max or far away from market it makes more sense but he is on deimos


[29-Jul-24 07:43 PM] jcheung#0000
not sure where you're seeing those numbers at


[29-Jul-24 07:43 PM] finestone#0000
building an STO


[29-Jul-24 07:44 PM] finestone#0000
compared to renting 3 warehouses


[29-Jul-24 07:44 PM] jcheung#0000
because it's worth it?


[29-Jul-24 07:45 PM] jcheung#0000
or rather, can be worth it?


[29-Jul-24 07:45 PM] finestone#0000
How is that worth it?


[29-Jul-24 07:45 PM] finestone#0000
he can build a building with that space that produces way more than 300 per week


[29-Jul-24 07:45 PM] jcheung#0000
sure, and what are you using it for here again?


[29-Jul-24 07:46 PM] finestone#0000
30k cash i guess?


[29-Jul-24 07:46 PM] jcheung#0000
it's very useful for giving you longer periods before you have to focus on deimos


[29-Jul-24 07:46 PM] finestone#0000
but again he isnt losing space


[29-Jul-24 07:46 PM] finestone#0000
he can rent warehouse


[29-Jul-24 07:47 PM] jcheung#0000
without a STO you have to be on it every 3-4 days no matter what-if you have other things that you need done, you can't let deimos slip


[29-Jul-24 07:47 PM] jcheung#0000
even with rentals you need to manually move things over


[29-Jul-24 07:47 PM] jcheung#0000
the base isn't going to feed itself out of warehouse even if it's shutting down


[29-Jul-24 07:47 PM] jcheung#0000
want to go on vacation for a week? rip.


[29-Jul-24 07:48 PM] finestone#0000
okay thats a good point still probably not worth it for new player


[29-Jul-24 07:48 PM] tanda#0000
STO's are invaluable and you will want to make space for them


[29-Jul-24 07:49 PM] tanda#0000
but I didn't have one for like a month


[29-Jul-24 07:49 PM] jcheung#0000
now if this was a base that was sub-100/d i/o i would say "sure, work out of CM"


[29-Jul-24 07:49 PM] finestone#0000
understood your saying since its 500 space it should have a STO


[29-Jul-24 07:50 PM] tanda#0000
it's alright if you want to make it about step 4-5 of filling out a base (after all if you can't fill it up, there's no point having it)


[29-Jul-24 07:50 PM] finestone#0000
I will provide 300 space examples in future üôÇ


[29-Jul-24 07:50 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, i'm also for sure not saying it has to be the first building


[29-Jul-24 10:14 PM] riseoffilth#0000
For fear of typing out an essay, just wanted to say, I'm still looking for any folks, especially new players (with PRO) to make some investments/loans in for some industries I'm particularly interested in. Looking for manufacturing, Smelting, construction, and chemistry. DM me if you got some permits and are interested (or are low level, I can get ya mats for HQ upgrades)


[29-Jul-24 10:33 PM] finestone#0000
I will be working in Metallurgy, Electronics, and probably get into Chem what did you have in mind?


[29-Jul-24 10:34 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Specifically, looking for someone to drop on Nascent to process GRN/mats into C, extract ALO


[29-Jul-24 10:34 PM] finestone#0000
I currently have a large TI operation i am setting up afer that some SD then pretty open


[29-Jul-24 10:34 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Then looking for someone to smelt additional AL


[29-Jul-24 10:34 PM] riseoffilth#0000
As far as chem, looking to have someone to expand PG production with a base of POLs


[29-Jul-24 10:35 PM] riseoffilth#0000
maybe a CHP base to produce SC, PFE, and other fun chem items


[29-Jul-24 10:36 PM] tanda#0000
there's a project and support in ADI for the PG base as well

[29-Jul-24 10:41 PM] finestone#0000
After TI and Software. I was Planning a chem base: AML for TAI processing: with CHP for SC. You are in the market for PFE as well?


[29-Jul-24 10:44 PM] finestone#0000
Also i was told you may know if there is a market for SEQ


[29-Jul-24 10:45 PM] riseoffilth#0000
imo, not at all. Absolutely not.

[29-Jul-24 10:47 PM] riseoffilth#0000
Hospitals are bad POPI , and drones are largely unused throughout the game


[29-Jul-24 10:48 PM] riseoffilth#0000
So TAI and ZR are 2 items Im looking to source, or create a supply of, as you said, explicitly for SC production. I need ZR production increased for my use as well, so im buying that


[29-Jul-24 10:48 PM] finestone#0000
what do you mean by POPI sad about drones.


[29-Jul-24 10:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000
And yes, PFE is profitable at a rate I think the market and governors like me will use


[29-Jul-24 10:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000
id like to see a greater market supply


[29-Jul-24 10:49 PM] finestone#0000
I will have a TAI EXT running very soon


[29-Jul-24 10:49 PM] riseoffilth#0000
POPI is population infrastructure. It is a blanket term for buildings made on planets to allow fulfillment to provide happiness and sustain larger workforces and highend workers


[29-Jul-24 10:50 PM] finestone#0000
understood thanks for clarifcation.


[29-Jul-24 10:50 PM] riseoffilth#0000
you are now on my list üôÇ


[29-Jul-24 10:53 PM] finestone#0000
I will let you know as soon as its setup. Any idea on amounts (TAI) your looking for? and price your willing to pay?


[29-Jul-24 10:59 PM] finestone#0000
Hence why i was going to reprocess it there wasnt really a market for the minerals only the TA


[29-Jul-24 11:00 PM] finestone#0000
due to the up front capitol cost of AML that's understandable.


[29-Jul-24 11:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
well, my goal is not to use it personally (the TAI)


[29-Jul-24 11:11 PM] riseoffilth#0000
i was hoping to find someone wanting to build AMLs, help them fund the base, because im rich in afabs, and then find a TAI source


[29-Jul-24 11:12 PM] riseoffilth#0000
and just connect the metaphorical wire


[29-Jul-24 11:12 PM] finestone#0000
I have a TAI source and want to build AMLs

[29-Jul-24 11:13 PM] riseoffilth#0000
for ease of logistics, it is my preference that the AML base be on Bober. How do you feel about that


[29-Jul-24 11:16 PM] finestone#0000
I will check it out. finishing up work atm


[29-Jul-24 11:17 PM] finestone#0000
where is bober


[29-Jul-24 11:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
next to ANT

ZV-307b


[29-Jul-24 11:19 PM] finestone#0000
ahh wonderful yes that will work fine I am on phobos and TAI will come from WU070 going to market, so easy.


[29-Jul-24 11:22 PM] finestone#0000
Give me some time to get my TI operation rolling and then we can discuss a possible loan so i can build the AML as i dont have the capitol to do so.


[29-Jul-24 11:29 PM] finestone#0000
2 CHP 1 AML Seems well balanced with 1 SC 2 CA producing 51 SC per day (max experts)


[29-Jul-24 11:32 PM] finestone#0000
so that would be the starting point and i would have enough TAI for constant production and have room for expansion let me know your thoughts


[29-Jul-24 11:32 PM] finestone#0000
Problem is CC estimates 2mil start up cost.


[29-Jul-24 11:34 PM] finestone#0000
with the pricy parts being ABH ADE ASE RBH RDE RSE and TSH


[30-Jul-24 12:09 AM] finestone#0000
@riseoffilth Also according to Planner PFE is not very profitable at all


[30-Jul-24 12:11 AM] riseoffilth#0000
my advice is to max out the planet BOBER for all AMLs


[30-Jul-24 12:11 AM] riseoffilth#0000
and then a separate planet for CHPs


[30-Jul-24 12:11 AM] finestone#0000
whys that


[30-Jul-24 12:12 AM] riseoffilth#0000
Because to make PFE, you need REA, which requires BRM


[30-Jul-24 12:12 AM] riseoffilth#0000
BRM is very large


[30-Jul-24 12:12 AM] riseoffilth#0000
the best setup involves having 2 players work together, one with a RES base on location for BRM, another with a CHP base turning it into REA


[30-Jul-24 12:13 AM] riseoffilth#0000
that way you have cheap access to BRM, and can mass produce REA and just import AMM


[30-Jul-24 12:13 AM] riseoffilth#0000
KI-840c is such a planet


[30-Jul-24 12:14 AM] riseoffilth#0000
math says that each permit makes about 40-45k/day profit with PFE sale price of 450/u and an AMM cost of 100/u


[30-Jul-24 12:18 AM] finestone#0000
BRM is mined?


[30-Jul-24 12:18 AM] riseoffilth#0000
it is indeed


[30-Jul-24 12:20 AM] finestone#0000
BRM seems to be the profit in this chain with current market


[30-Jul-24 12:20 AM] jcheung#0000
ü§î


[30-Jul-24 12:21 AM] finestone#0000
regardless having 2 planets maxes with AML and CHP is certainly a goal to attain


[30-Jul-24 12:21 AM] riseoffilth#0000
if you wanna move it...


[30-Jul-24 12:21 AM] riseoffilth#0000

I see the Market price for BRM is what is throwing the calculations off.


[30-Jul-24 12:25 AM] evany.#0000
yeah like was said though its because no one buys brm publically it seems


[30-Jul-24 12:26 AM] finestone#0000

tearing up and down an entire base regularly just so you dont have to move things

hmmmm i wasnt referencing that but thats an interesting concept say if you planned to do it once a month


[30-Jul-24 04:09 PM] realharvey#0000
don't do it


[30-Jul-24 04:10 PM] realharvey#0000
rebuilding the base will always cost you extra material


[30-Jul-24 04:10 PM] realharvey#0000
its also quite a chore


[30-Jul-24 04:39 PM] finestone#0000
haha okay. i was just referencing starting points. Rise was saying 2 CHP 1 AML is not good because i should have a full planet of AML and a full planet of CHP. My point was scaling with capitol. So as i get more assest i can decon the CHP and move them to another planet.


[30-Jul-24 04:43 PM] realharvey#0000
Depending on the availability of the Inputs on the CX this can be the right choice


[30-Jul-24 04:44 PM] jcheung#0000
Oh yeah, that's fine. It wasn't clear what you wanted to do


[30-Jul-24 04:46 PM] finestone#0000

[04-Aug-24 01:29 PM] sidepipe#0000
@finestone for the PP base, we offer a loan of 2.1M. I think DvorakDwarf has the blueprint, but that should pay for the base and consumables to get you up and running. The loan is 0% interest, 60 days for repayment!

[04-Aug-24 04:56 PM] jcheung#0000
Quite often it's actually more efficient regarding transit time to jump to the next system over as well, if you're trying to save fuel. And if you're redlining your fuel consumption, well... then it doesn't really matter if there's a ftl component does it


[04-Aug-24 04:56 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Someone dedicating, lets say, a 2k t/m3 FTL, for their AGRI/FP sheet, will only be using it like 1/3 --> 1/2 of the time... You can bring others on board, like 1-2 of them... With max 2, you can make true gains from such a thing.


[04-Aug-24 04:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Totally SUS, right now.


[04-Aug-24 04:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You're quite a bit away, from any CX.... Do you stockpile fuel, over there, or does it just magically appear?


[04-Aug-24 04:59 PM] jcheung#0000
Ironically if you're far from cx, you want more ftl not less


[04-Aug-24 04:59 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's also costs... I can bill a client like x amount, for a standard, 2k t/m3 burn, from one planet to another. If I max STL burn... Well you're now adding a factor of a magnitude to that cost. If you burn to much, you'll now stuck at your destination.


[04-Aug-24 04:59 PM] jcheung#0000
Ff is easier to pack than stl


[04-Aug-24 04:59 PM] jvaler#0000
memes aside, the rest of the planets in the KI-446 system are pretty hostile. hermes really is the cheapest to build on in comparison. plus it's already got infrastructure placed down by me

YES.... BUT (this stuff still ain't really modeled).

so you can get your water, ship it to HYF, then ship that to INC, all in the same system

the ALO deposits' yield + CoGC means you can supply a full 20 SME base with ALO and still have plenty of room left over for INC

well exactly half the room left, cause 475 area is normally 14 EXT max


[07-Aug-24 08:27 AM] jvaler#0000
not sure... it's good money but again it's logi constrained
remember that you can always rely on the LM for shipping though. darkfuel is a reliable CX shipper, but they only accept ads with good prices. 25-30k for a WCB/LCB trip is usually their price


[07-Aug-24 08:31 AM] jvaler#0000

[07-Aug-24 08:39 AM] igfloz#0000
I've found it can help if you have another player to team with. Personally I feed into another players needs. i.e. I grow GRN for their C factory and I also mine ALO for their smelting planet. Logistics can somewhat be shared in that manner


[07-Aug-24 11:15 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The ratios for Nascent, if you go full Indy experts, go about 1:2 EXT bases per SME bases, running AL processes.

[07-Aug-24 11:19 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Not the best if you wanna export that AL, but it's good for cross product transfer between groupies, and using that extra AL for something, instead of diverting from say Deimos, or in terms of shipping, ALO -> Vulcan.


[07-Aug-24 11:20 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The other two are good still. If you want more AL-ish things; just gotta pick a way of going at it.


[07-Aug-24 11:28 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Halcyon? it is resource ext CoGC


[07-Aug-24 11:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yea, but you need INS though for Halcyon. INC margins are kinda thin, compared to other things. My vote is Nascent, if you want the best margins for C + ALO/AL stuff. Hmm, 30k PIOs, 3k SETs. I think I'm looking at some sort of COGC change in a year or two. CON/CHM, or just keep it RES?


[07-Aug-24 11:51 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It wont matter individually, since COGC votes are a public thing, if people make their votes every 10 days. Timeframe is like 12 months. I think I've been seeing dozens of newbros popping into APEX general chat, like 10-20, on every weekend. Lots of new people to drop bases, in like a few months, or more.


[09-Aug-24 03:12 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
I'm not sure what to focus on, having gone through the CX to see what's in demand and of those what are selling. I only came up with a short number of commodities that looked lucrative. Besides the very basic Manufacturer entry loop of doing PE or MCG. 

I started working on OFF as it looks like there are a few large orders between 90-95 AIC, I can pump out around 334 per day, there's around 14k orders in that price bracket to fulfil but it's only going to net me around 14k per day

You'll likely need to make SEA combined with something else because there wasn't that much demand when I looked at it last


[09-Aug-24 03:45 PM] imjoshuarice#0000
Though looks like the ROI on SEA isn't too great, not super high demand at the mo' either.

I mean, I don't know what the demand is or what your goal is


[09-Aug-24 03:48 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah it seems that'd saturate the market. ignore the 7d traded CXM figure at ANT, that's skewed by one big purchase as seen on CXPC

~153 SEA/d with 5 experts, with 20 BMPs would be ~3k SEA/d

@imjoshuarice if you don't have the liquid capital to afford the time to leave up CXOB sell orders, you'll need to sell to bids. and you similarly wouldn't have the liquidity to wait around for buy orders to fill on input materials. if this is your situation, the settings jcheung just posted should reflect that more accurately.

Quick quetion. 

I have one base and no HQ upgrades as of the moment. I assumed that the fact that my starting based has 750 area means that from the start I have 2 permits. When I build the second base I will have 500 area for both. 

Do all first bases have 750 area as default?
I guess that I will need to upgrade the company HQ to get the second permit for a second base?


[14-Aug-24 06:44 AM] revoric#0000
you have 2 permits spent on your first base currently 500 -> 750 , upgrading your base will give you another iirc


[14-Aug-24 06:45 AM] skyrey#0000
What if I want to start a second base, can I reuse the second permit?


[14-Aug-24 06:48 AM] skyrey#0000
I am just wondering if it is stuck at 750 area. If I can reduce it to 500 and use the permit elsewhere, it will be very convenient


[14-Aug-24 06:51 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's not stuck, you just applied 2 permits, to a single base. Permit applications offer dwindling returns on base area. 1st permit to a base --- 500 area.... 2nd permit to a base --- +250 area.... 3rd permit to a base ---- +250 area.


[14-Aug-24 06:52 AM] skyrey#0000
Right. The thing is that I never selected an option to apply 2 permits, it was at 750 area since the company was created


[14-Aug-24 06:54 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Bugs, maybe? You can always change it by accessing your BS buffer, on the left-hand quick access bar. BUT....

You can only remove permits, should you have more than 1 applied to a base, if you have >= 500;750 area built up.

That looks like just a straight up bug, and a frustrating one. I'd hard refresh the browser to make sure it's not just a weird visual bug. If that doesn't work then I'd ping molp on the main game server

It has been that way since I started 44 days ago, thus it is not something that just appeared. Oddly enough it was the case when I first looked at the game almost a year ago, this is why I thought it was normal.

I can try building above 500 area to see if it allows me to?

[14-Aug-24 07:04 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You have 1 permit applied. Per the default metric, stated above, you're hard set at 500 area for that base. This is a GUI bug...... You can post something on the PRUN forums, and just disregard it, until it's fixed.


[14-Aug-24 07:08 AM] skyrey#0000
I will make a post at the main discord server and send a ship to buy enough materials and build a farmstead. If it allows me to exceed the 500 area limit with this farmstead, I will update the post as it may be a more major of a bug

It very likely won't allow you to do so. Its a graphical bug. It's actionable right now, if you just post your evidence on the main server, in the bugs channel.


[14-Aug-24 07:10 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Rather... the forums?


[14-Aug-24 07:13 AM] skyrey#0000
I will post on both


[14-Aug-24 07:20 AM] skyrey#0000
Posted both on the main server and the forum


[23-Aug-24 04:48 AM] cptboby#0000
so i started on harmonia with 2 FRM and 1 INC , making C , got 17+days of consumables for the workers. what would be the next logical step?


[23-Aug-24 04:53 AM] jvaler#0000
next step would be to just scale up to more buildings


[23-Aug-24 04:54 AM] cptboby#0000
so just make more C ?


[23-Aug-24 04:54 AM] jvaler#0000
it should be most cost efficient to use the full 500 area of your base before looking at getting a second one (unless AGP grant gets involved)


[23-Aug-24 04:55 AM] jvaler#0000
if that looks to be more profitable than FP, sure. i don't really keep up with RAT or C profitability though


[23-Aug-24 04:55 AM] jvaler#0000
with only 1 INC atm you have plenty of freedom to pivot to whatever you'd like


[23-Aug-24 04:55 AM] cptboby#0000
what is FP i cant find it in recipes


[23-Aug-24 04:55 AM] jvaler#0000
prunplanner.org should be valuable in helping you determine which is more profitable


[23-Aug-24 04:56 AM] jvaler#0000
that's a building


[23-Aug-24 04:56 AM] jvaler#0000
`BUI FP` in a buffer


[23-Aug-24 05:04 AM] laaxus#0000
oh so you're the one who took the spot


[23-Aug-24 05:04 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm planning to make a base there, there were 17 spot available yesterday, but 16 now


[23-Aug-24 05:05 AM] cptboby#0000
what happens when there are no spots left?


[23-Aug-24 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
new player can still start there, but other players can't build a new base there


[23-Aug-24 05:22 AM] cptboby#0000

2FP ,8FRM ,8INC ,3RIG


[23-Aug-24 05:27 AM] jvaler#0000
to optimize your setup you need to go all-in on either FP or INC, because each of those buildings are a different industry.

experts make a substantial difference in productivity and you can only use the max number of experts for a single industry per base. https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/efficiency-factors/index.html#experts

try running that plan again with either 5 food industries or 5 resource extraction experts


[23-Aug-24 05:28 AM] jvaler#0000
(you should plan all bases assuming max experts, because as long as you keep playing you're going to inevitably get 5 experts)


[23-Aug-24 05:29 AM] cptboby#0000
i have 2 Agriculture experts


[23-Aug-24 05:29 AM] jvaler#0000
doesn't really matter what you have now :P


[23-Aug-24 05:29 AM] jvaler#0000
you're going to get more


[23-Aug-24 05:43 AM] cptboby#0000

5 experts in Food Industries and COGC is agriculture

since i have pro i can just buy water right on the planet so no need to haul. fuel seems expensive


[23-Aug-24 06:07 AM] jvaler#0000
as long as you try to maximize your cargo load per trip, fuel isn't too bad


[23-Aug-24 06:07 AM] jvaler#0000
FRM water in particular is incredibly easy on logistics


[23-Aug-24 06:08 AM] jvaler#0000
this looks great! are you interested in an AGP grant to get this up and running faster?

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[23-Aug-24 09:40 AM] laaxus#0000
if possible, in the next 3 days


[23-Aug-24 09:41 AM] realharvey#0000
I've been rushing my base there 2 months ago. Was at around the same count. So you probably have another 3 months at least to get a base there


[23-Aug-24 09:41 AM] laaxus#0000
does base number ever go up ?


[23-Aug-24 09:43 AM] realharvey#0000
Heavily depends on player inflow


[23-Aug-24 10:14 AM] riseoffilth#0000
anyone interested in a free and profitable mining base? I do shipping, just send conts and make money. Planet is KI-840c, mining CUO


[23-Aug-24 11:22 AM] razesdark#0000
How much ore do you need? I got a CUO base there already that has half its permit open. I could expand it


[23-Aug-24 11:39 AM] riseoffilth#0000
TOO LATE!


[23-Aug-24 11:39 AM] riseoffilth#0000
but a fair amount


[23-Aug-24 11:40 AM] riseoffilth#0000
and the market looks like it could use some too


[23-Aug-24 11:40 AM] riseoffilth#0000
so i doubt there will be an excess


[23-Aug-24 11:40 AM] riseoffilth#0000
imo, if you have the shipping, id expand to put to market


[23-Aug-24 12:06 PM] razesdark#0000
I probably could at this point. Half a base was more than enough when I serviced it with starter ships üòõ


[23-Aug-24 07:13 PM] evany.#0000
@everyone

Project Shippening

The primary goal is to build kits for ADI use in the WKP project. If we successfully meet this need, we could expand to selling these kits outside of ADI. Should external demand grow, we will consider selling to other producers and exploring additional market opportunities. Eventually, we might even place units on CX‚Äîalthough demand there is currently low, it‚Äôs uncertain if this is due to high prices or unmet needs. 

Locations:

    Metallurgy - Vulcan:
    Development will be prioritized on Vulcan, as Deimos is reserved for newer players. SKF operations may remain on Deimos due to existing workforce commitments, but most smelting and manufacturing will occur on Vulcan.

    Chemical - Bober / Elon:
    Individuals working in this area may join CULT to benefit from bonuses on Elon, but Bober is a logistically better option.

Goals & Requirements:

Please note that some roles are essential for the project's success, while others are optional. If we do not fill the required positions, the project will not proceed. We may adjust the availability of roles based on interest.

Required Roles:

    SKF Base: https://prunplanner.org/shared/52946850-aa35-4053-a1a5-a717fa4ed993

    TIO EXT: https://prunplanner.org/shared/600748c1-3db0-48e5-962e-700227f5ee9d

Optional Roles:

    BER EXT: https://prunplanner.org/shared/7275fde4-b1a8-4f01-979d-040935ae1bf9
    LI EXT: (Just extractors and STO, reach out if you need assistance)
    O EXT: (Just extractors and STO, reach out if you need assistance)

Financing:

These kits are being developed for ADI members and financing will be available but will be in a loan format. Loans will be handed out at 0% interest but the loan will be at 100% with no grant portion. 

How You Can Participate:

Sign up and indicate your interest in participating by voting in the poll below. If you have a preference for a specific base, please specify your first and second choices. Even if you're not interested in running a base, but can assist in other ways, please let us know. There is a significant amount of small products that we require so if you can provide these reliably below CX pricing please reach out or mention it somewhere. Total list of products required (per day) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PnJ1PCWYt1mwwJtdCa5qLHx2YYlBJWuiS8cfjrlsb5Y/edit?usp=sharing

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to post them in this thread.

[24-Aug-24 09:35 AM] flor2081#0000
I'm confused, project coordinator role has perms to tag all roles and \@everyone so why cant we do that?


[24-Aug-24 09:36 AM] flor2081#0000
Is that disabled in every channel seperarely?


[24-Aug-24 12:11 PM] jvaler#0000
hm good point


[24-Aug-24 12:12 PM] jvaler#0000
i can give y'all perms to that channel if you want


[24-Aug-24 12:17 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'd consider dropping a role-react channel, for anyone that got past the airlock. Letting people self-manage their server prefs would cut down on the management. Of course, some thing can be kept behind closed-doors.


[24-Aug-24 12:19 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Info boards would be better kept as public, so that someone knows what such project is. Of course these things are best built from the bottom up. Editing channel/role perms on the fly is a messy business, that I am not involving myself in, since 5 years ago.


[24-Aug-24 12:20 PM] flor2081#0000
N-no that's not what i meant


[24-Aug-24 12:21 PM] flor2081#0000
I mean we cant tag roles


[24-Aug-24 12:21 PM] flor2081#0000
Even tho we have perms to tag roles


[24-Aug-24 12:21 PM] jcheung#0000
If it makes you feel better, i understood what you meant xflqr


[24-Aug-24 12:21 PM] flor2081#0000
Yay (:


[24-Aug-24 12:21 PM] realharvey#0000
I do role react channels annoying. If you forget to role yourself you are kept out of it. I just manage ping permissions per channel basis for myself. More customisation

Oh, right


[24-Aug-24 12:23 PM] jcheung#0000
@jvaler can you pin this or put it somewhere visible with low traffic?


[24-Aug-24 12:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a discord thing. Any # hash tag, with a masterlock thing, has a thread. No activity on there, means no new content. Read + comment fully, and the stuff will stay up.


[24-Aug-24 12:28 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I don't think they're meant to be as like alternate channels. Limited permissions, and what not.


[24-Aug-24 12:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It would seem, as a better idea, to have different threads, for different things... A survey thread, project idea threads, advice threads, et.c. They're generally permutable. Non-admin/mod users can just prop them up --- they're meant to be disposable.


[24-Aug-24 12:29 PM] jcheung#0000
I think you're missing the plot


[24-Aug-24 12:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If you want pins, you need a dedicated channel.


[24-Aug-24 12:30 PM] jcheung#0000
I found the poll, so i could tag someone to pin it. Story's over


[24-Aug-24 12:31 PM] jcheung#0000
Stuff in threads are pinnable. Pins from threads show up on main channel pins in mobile and in the thread itself on desktop


[24-Aug-24 12:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yep. I've tried pinning stuff in threads on UFO, and others. Been looking into it for the past 3 days, on-and-off. I don't have a solution. :/

Yeah


[24-Aug-24 01:23 PM] flor2081#0000
So maybe that's disabled in channel settings or something? I cant see channel settings


[24-Aug-24 01:23 PM] flor2081#0000
But that really should work, weird


[24-Aug-24 01:23 PM] jvaler#0000
hmmm okay


[24-Aug-24 01:24 PM] jvaler#0000
channel settings have coordinator @ perms set to neutral


[24-Aug-24 01:24 PM] jvaler#0000
but the default @ perms are set to false


[24-Aug-24 01:24 PM] jvaler#0000
i assumed neutral would use the default role perms, but it seems it uses the no-role perms instead


[24-Aug-24 01:25 PM] jvaler#0000
gimme a sec


[24-Aug-24 01:26 PM] jvaler#0000
@flor2081 does it work now?

[24-Aug-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
i think only associate category was affected...?


[24-Aug-24 01:30 PM] jvaler#0000
had some outdated perms compared to newer channels


[24-Aug-24 01:42 PM] flor2081#0000
I only checked here and in airlock


[24-Aug-24 01:42 PM] flor2081#0000
So also airlock


[24-Aug-24 01:54 PM] jvaler#0000
oops yeah that also had that single perm set lmfao

to indicate interest the best i'd suggest right now is to vote for whatever roles you would be interested in.

grant will help but is unrelated to ship kit project, I tried to make it pretty clear how to partake if you so desire 
but loans would be given for any bases if you cannot afford; so starting should not be particularly challenging, though if your a newer player (as it seems) i'd encourage you to focus on an EXT / SME role(s) that have decent returns!

What is an Antarean? People post pics of ants, but at least the naming conventions in ANT space should lend you better memes. üòõ

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antares
```
Its traditional name Antares derives from the Ancient Greek ·ºàŒΩœÑŒ¨œÅŒ∑œÇ,[17] meaning "rival to Ares", due to the similarity of its reddish hue to the appearance of the planet Mars.[18] The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early Mesopotamian astronomers[15] which is considered an outdated speculation, because the name of this star in Mesopotamian astronomy has always been "heart of Scorpion" and it was associated with the goddess Lisin.[19] Some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after Antar, or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the Arab warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems Mu'allaqat.[15] However, the name "Antares" is already proven in the Greek culture, e.g. in Ptolemy's Almagest and Tetrabiblos.

Antares is the brightest star in the constellation of Scorpius. It has the Bayer designation Œ± Scorpii, which is Latinised to Alpha Scorpii. Often referred to as "the heart of the scorpion", Antares is flanked by œÉ Scorpii and œÑ Scorpii near the center of the constellation.

I would be surprised if you can maintain an FP base for long by buying crops off the CX - there‚Äôs basically no one out there who‚Äôs growing agri just to sell it, so a lot of what you see on the market is people selling any surplus they might have made


[31-Aug-24 12:38 PM] sidepipe#0000
Even if you do drive the price up a lot, you‚Äôre basically relying on other people to build FRMs just to sell to the market, which will almost never happen as long as the CX prices are low enough that you can profitably run an FP off it. At least, that‚Äôs what I believe would happen


[31-Aug-24 12:40 PM] sidepipe#0000
I could be wrong, and you can always spin up your own FRMs / HYFs if it doesn‚Äôt work out. Just wanted to add a note of caution

[01-Sep-24 08:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
Trust me


[01-Sep-24 08:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
it's not a big deal


[01-Sep-24 08:33 AM] marat_sh#0000
you are not missing out


[01-Sep-24 08:38 AM] marat_sh#0000
for once Agro goods might be priced decently


[01-Sep-24 08:56 AM] flor2081#0000
harmonia has been close to 0 plots for months


[01-Sep-24 08:56 AM] flor2081#0000
so no rush, probably


[01-Sep-24 08:57 AM] marat_sh#0000
few weeks ago you said the same when it was 15 plots üòÖ


[01-Sep-24 08:57 AM] laaxus#0000
it was a stable 16 2 days ago


[01-Sep-24 08:57 AM] laaxus#0000
and now that it was yelled on the public place of the 2 major discord, many people will rush it


[01-Sep-24 08:57 AM] flor2081#0000
nah accounts get deleted every week


[01-Sep-24 08:58 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah, even if plot are filled, I sitll have a chance


[01-Sep-24 08:58 AM] flor2081#0000
it tends to shuffle around 0 for a while


[01-Sep-24 08:58 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah so no rush üòÑ

[01-Sep-24 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
it was stable as 16 3 day ago


[01-Sep-24 09:02 AM] laaxus#0000
so I did not feel the need to rush


[01-Sep-24 09:02 AM] flor2081#0000
yeah but the "stable" thing is over the entire week kinda


[01-Sep-24 09:02 AM] flor2081#0000
i'm pretty sure the accounts get deleted in waves


[01-Sep-24 01:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
yeah i rushed like a madman 2 months ago when it was at 6 plots...


[01-Sep-24 01:49 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
@laaxus If you want to rush it now, you know where to find some cash! Shrewdbank is here to serve


[01-Sep-24 01:52 PM] laaxus#0000
I have the cash, what I need is a ship to send the materials üò≠


[01-Sep-24 01:53 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
ah i see


[01-Sep-24 01:53 PM] shrewdsun_88540#0000
sadly i dont have a ship inbound so i cant really help you in that department


[01-Sep-24 01:54 PM] laaxus#0000
Mine arrive in 2h


[01-Sep-24 01:54 PM] laaxus#0000
But I have to send it to deimos first to upgrade hq


[01-Sep-24 01:54 PM] jcheung#0000
watch, in 6 months we'll still be rushing because there's "less than 5 plots!"


[01-Sep-24 01:54 PM] laaxus#0000
Hope it's true


[01-Sep-24 01:55 PM] sidepipe#0000
@laaxus I'll have a free WCB at ANT in 4h if you want to send me shipping contracts


[01-Sep-24 01:55 PM] jcheung#0000
i have 2 idle WCBs at ANT if you can get me conts before i sign off for the day


[01-Sep-24 01:55 PM] jcheung#0000
which may be in around 10 min


[01-Sep-24 01:55 PM] jcheung#0000
...first come first serve


[01-Sep-24 01:56 PM] jcheung#0000
that said i won't be doing max burn


[01-Sep-24 01:57 PM] laaxus#0000
Would any of you ship to norwick ?


[01-Sep-24 01:57 PM] tanda#0000
6 months ago when it was 14 plots left I rushed a base onto there

funny thing, this base is slatted to be torn down eventually


[01-Sep-24 01:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
I can take some stuff to norwick, I'll need to do repairs there tomorrow anyway - I'll figure out how much space will be left

I'll take whatever is left, I would send 3k T if I could


[01-Sep-24 02:04 PM] sidepipe#0000
should be 700m/2600 T free


[01-Sep-24 02:04 PM] laaxus#0000
When do you leave ?


[01-Sep-24 02:05 PM] jcheung#0000
funny thing about my harmonia base is i didn't even plan to put it here


[01-Sep-24 02:05 PM] laaxus#0000
I'd like to send the contract in 1h15 if possible


[01-Sep-24 02:05 PM] jcheung#0000
once it's no longer needed i plan on flattening it üòÇ

FP, I hope üòõ


[01-Sep-24 02:07 PM] jcheung#0000
~~i was hoping there was some SIO~~


[01-Sep-24 02:07 PM] laaxus#0000
Norwick is just currently too far away for me to supply it (and my 2 other base) with one single ship (the other is currently at moria to buy an upgrade kit)
I think with 2.6kT it should be ok for a few days


[01-Sep-24 02:08 PM] laaxus#0000
Rat rat cof then Rat


[01-Sep-24 02:08 PM] jcheung#0000
shoulda given me your upgrade kit


[01-Sep-24 02:08 PM] jcheung#0000
i just departed from MOR yesterday with someone else's upgrade kit


[01-Sep-24 02:08 PM] laaxus#0000
XD should have asked for it


[01-Sep-24 02:08 PM] laaxus#0000

[01-Sep-24 02:09 PM] jcheung#0000
oh well


[01-Sep-24 02:09 PM] laaxus#0000
I'll ask for the next one in 10 days


[01-Sep-24 02:09 PM] jcheung#0000
mmm. i can try to time a ship to be up there in 10 days, i think that's doable


[01-Sep-24 02:09 PM] jcheung#0000
have stuff up that way i need to be there for in 12 days or less


[01-Sep-24 02:10 PM] laaxus#0000
I can't confirm it's 10 days, it's just what shaitr told me


[01-Sep-24 02:10 PM] laaxus#0000
It's ok anyway it's a good exp√©rience


[01-Sep-24 02:11 PM] sidepipe#0000

[01-Sep-24 02:12 PM] jcheung#0000

[01-Sep-24 02:12 PM] jcheung#0000
i'll be doing semi-regular runs up there


[01-Sep-24 02:12 PM] jcheung#0000
probably... once a month i think


[01-Sep-24 02:14 PM] sidepipe#0000
i make a few trips to exchange items for currency between AIC and NCC. Everyone wants to swap their NCC for something else, but no one wants to buy NCC üòÑ

Yeah, and you'll need to open the BS buffer for that specific base as well


[01-Sep-24 02:32 PM] sidepipe#0000

[07-Sep-24 12:58 PM] laaxus#0000
do you think you would have place for 60T more than the kit ? there's something I want to take from moria


[07-Sep-24 01:11 PM] jcheung#0000
Yes. Whatever can fit in a WCB minus around 20m3 for my own stuff you can have


[07-Sep-24 01:12 PM] laaxus#0000

Hello everyone! I've been discussing the idea of a gateway co-op with the other ADI Coordinators.  The core thought is a collaborative shared-ownership model for a pair of gateways in Antares space:

* Anyone in ANT who wants to join the co-op is welcome.
* We track the contributions, and each contributing member has a percentage of the gateway assigned to them. So you're sort of a partial owner of the gateway.
* The co-op maintains a sheet tracking contributed materials, and also "planned materials"- materials intended to be contributed, in an effort to avoid accidentally making too many of a particular gateway material.
* (less importantly) Tolls, if any, are distributed according to shares
* (more importantly) All members are incentivized to ensure someone (anyone) in the co-op maintains governorship of the gateway planet.
* Any member agrees to uphold the co-op if they are elected governor.
* Someone works out prices (not for reimbursement, just for proportional gateway contribution calculations)

Since we need to make two gateways for this thing to do anything, we should pool contributions for all the gateways constructed under the program, to minimize complexity in distributions later.

At the beginning that EXT will help you a lot with logistics


[16-Sep-24 09:07 AM] jcheung#0000
so honestly


[16-Sep-24 09:07 AM] jcheung#0000
some people will yell at me for saying this


[16-Sep-24 09:07 AM] jcheung#0000
but if deimos only has 2 factories, you may as well drop your PP2 there for 60 days


[16-Sep-24 09:08 AM] jcheung#0000
it's not as efficient, but it's a heck of a lot cheaper


[16-Sep-24 09:08 AM] jcheung#0000
unless you're planning on taking the ADI grant, in which case you should have a lot more things on your plan üòÑ

[16-Sep-24 09:09 AM] jcheung#0000
also i say 60 days because you can effectively scrap the building for very little cost to you then


[16-Sep-24 09:11 AM] martinswdev#0000
Is it just 1 grant or can I use it in chunks ? and what else would I look to add


[16-Sep-24 09:12 AM] laaxus#0000
with a grant of  1M, it's kinda expected you spend 600-800k on buildings


[16-Sep-24 09:15 AM] jcheung#0000
you get all of it in one shot, spend wherever, as long as you demonstrate that you won't, say.... spend it all on half of an AML üëÄ


[16-Sep-24 09:16 AM] jcheung#0000
i suggest using around 2/3 on buildings and then of the remaining, spend 1/2 - 3/4 on feedstock. the rest, keep on hand for emergencies, because you'll need something silly here or there

[16-Sep-24 10:23 AM] martinswdev#0000
Other than just bumping the PP2 up to 8 instead of 1, is there anything else I should consider

Yeah ticked those


[16-Sep-24 10:34 AM] jcheung#0000
mmm. at 313t import/d it may be worth going up to 2 STO, but starting at 1 and assessing isn't a bad idea

if links are locked into one receiving, can it be re-paired?


[16-Sep-24 08:56 PM] jcheung#0000
does it take time to travel from orbit to gateway, or are you good to go once in orbit?


[16-Sep-24 08:56 PM] jcheung#0000
rather, does it take additional time if ascending from surface to orbit, is there additional travel to get to gateway

Gateway Question Roundup
In #behind-the-scenes, molp asked for us to put our questions about the gateway into a forum post. So I‚Äôve consolidated some questions here:    Can one gateway send ships to more than one receiving gateway? Or does the gateway builder / controlling government set the destination?    If they are paired, can the destination gateway be changed? How...

one more.
if not paired, can you daisy chain gate jumps? can you go start > gate a > gate b > gate c > gate d > end? or would you have to set a new travel plan once you're at gate b

For anyone interested, I'm settling and building up A2A (planet next to vulcan and Deimos) for construction, with everything up to and including Techs. It'll take a month or so, but we are gonna get there

whats the benefits of tht planet


[21-Sep-24 06:37 PM] riseoffilth#0000
It is close to Antares and other construction and metallurgy planets, without being excessively expensive to settle and build on

i was looking where to settle 2 more bases and there won out. I had your YK- planet in the running though

but ultimately i opted away from Chem


[21-Sep-24 06:46 PM] riseoffilth#0000
cause i wanted more INS and Weldment production, and i didnt want to source it to someone else, because it makes 6 different items i need

what are YOU DOING?!?!!?


[21-Sep-24 06:51 PM] evov#0000
The only sticking point for me is the TSH. It's not cheap. Setup cost for the base will be high I'd imagine, but maybe the closer/cheaper shipping will more than cover the gap.

WEL on a TSH vs not TSH

[22-Sep-24 05:39 AM] evov#0000
When faced with a choice of where to build something.... how do people evaluate that choice?
What things influence the tradeoff between location and planet conditions?

A2A - Location = Awesome!
Needing TSH = baaad.


[22-Sep-24 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
The more I need shipping, the closer to the cx it needs to be
as for planet conditions, it's included in the roi


[22-Sep-24 05:44 AM] evov#0000
So, if you decided you wanted to build a base to produce PP2 as an example. What's your process to decide where to build it?


[22-Sep-24 05:55 AM] laaxus#0000
1) I'd check the shipping requirement of a pp2 base. (In this case, 1 WCB / 3 days seems enough). This means I could allow it to go up to 5 system distance from the CX
2) I look for every planets with the construction COGC within 5 of range of the CX
3) I look for input goods supply : can I find a supplier somewhere else than the CX ? if I can't, then closer to the cx is better
4) I compare the price of a base for the different planet
5) after that, taking into account the shipping capacity I have left, my future plan, and the off-cx supply if there's any, I choose. I don't have a math formula for that, just instinct.

PE floor about to give out :(. It's been a fun few weeks


[22-Sep-24 06:15 AM] evov#0000
So, 
1. Consider synergy with your existing bases / suppliers or anything else that might "break" the standard rules.
2. Limit options based on distance from CX (or other supply) for shipping requirements.
3. Limit options based on CoGC's within that distance.
4. Compare RoI of remaining options?
5. Build or not build on the best one if the numbers look juicy enough.

Does existing population of the planet factor at all for you?


[22-Sep-24 06:16 AM] laaxus#0000
"if it has a cogc, population is not an issue" is my moto

I don't use extensions and rarely use PrunPlanner for anything. I seem to be doing fine.
Agreed, existing tools can make life easier. But sometimes, the hand that you hold is the hand the holds you down.

[22-Sep-24 08:11 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, they're not terrible. Just need to double the ROI on any given base


[22-Sep-24 08:18 PM] evov#0000
TNP is also an interesting choice. Why would you want to build that? The only thing downstream of it is HSE or ship parts. HSE is kinda niche. Weekly trade <500, Supply stock on the CX >3000.. so I'm not predicting any major shortages there (at least not naturally occurring ones)


[22-Sep-24 08:23 PM] evov#0000
If you're chasing Afab production down the line... or increased Rfab even - I'd think a WPL base on Heph is a good choice. From memory it's a very low shipping requirement task, and NL / KV can be pressure points for LDE/RDE/ADE   (ask me how I know)


[22-Sep-24 08:23 PM] tanda#0000
Well, HSE is a component in Gateways, and rather more expensive than I'd like. I would just supply it from the CX but TCS is very low volume on there, I figured it would at least cushion me against shenanigans if I had my own production


[22-Sep-24 08:24 PM] tanda#0000
My notes don't mention it, but that's what the Astraeus base would be. at least enough KV production to supply RFAB production


[22-Sep-24 08:28 PM] evov#0000
Yea, there's a lot of PP3/PP4 bui time needed for gateways. I suspect prices of all those items will be going up. The HSE track is just very niche, and if the HSE price drops you're left holding the bag on a lot of inputs / bui's that aren't really good for anything else.


[22-Sep-24 08:30 PM] evov#0000
The fact that there's zero weekly trade of TC, on any cx, should be worth considering.

RDE
The market supply is thin, and day-to-day trading is pretty slow. But every now and then, a customer comes in who slurps in a lot of it in a big batch. Apart from me, there are a couple more producers, and our production combined pretty much overwhelms daily trades.

[24-Sep-24 01:15 AM] evov#0000
I don't have any numbers worked out for this, it's just an idea/concept at this stage. Just sort of throwing the idea out there to see if there is actually need/demand for something like this.

Basically wondering if there'd be any benefit in having someone like me deliver smelter inputs to players for free, and buy their outputs at price that reflects zero input costs. Doing delivery/pickup at the smelting planet. Effectively removing transport needs and significantly reducing early cashflow issues.

I notice people will produce what little AL they can, send part of a load back to the CX, wait for it to sell, buy whatever inputs they can, and repeat that process until their operation is big enough to be doing full loads on a regular basis. That just sounds like a process that would greatly benefit from outsourced logistics and short term financing.


[24-Sep-24 01:18 AM] laaxus#0000
This could work for players before they get their grants


[24-Sep-24 01:19 AM] evov#0000
My thoughts were that it would likely be beneficial until people can afford their first ship. Logsitics can be a hard constraint on people's growth/expansion early on.


[24-Sep-24 01:19 AM] laaxus#0000
This could be a program for the ADI

[24-Sep-24 01:22 AM] evov#0000
Yea, the AA model is a little bit different though as it's usually people dedicating a permit to a long term project and the more established players just take on the bulk of the logistics load.

This wouldn't need to be a long term commitment ( or any commitment at all beyond the length of time it takes to smelt/deliver the product )

[24-Sep-24 02:19 AM] evov#0000
Rough numbers for AL as a guide. I might have to round-down the buy price a touch to cover shipping etc, but that would be a rough guide. If it's something people are interested in I can potentially expand the concept to all the SME outputs (provided I can secure the inputs needed at scale)

[24-Sep-24 02:21 AM] evov#0000
A 20 SME base will push out 214 AL per day. So, works out to be about 66k per day, without needing to worry about cashflows or logistics. Just receive inputs, smelt, sell outputs.


[24-Sep-24 02:21 AM] jcheung#0000
...also when did ALO hit 160? I swear it was only 110 like... yesterday


[24-Sep-24 02:22 AM] realharvey#0000
ALO is heavy. It needs a lot of logistics to move it to the CX


[24-Sep-24 02:23 AM] jcheung#0000
Is this 66k before or after workforce?


[24-Sep-24 02:23 AM] evov#0000
Those are just the ant market numbers. If I can get it cheaper from people by buying in bulk... sure.


[24-Sep-24 02:25 AM] evov#0000
Yea... you'd still need to pay for workforce + repairs. Which is relatively low, but yea, would eat into the 66k per day for sure.


[24-Sep-24 02:28 AM] evov#0000
You can always make more $ buy transporting your finished AL up to MOR and sell it there. But again, you're adding time between buying inputs and getting cash for selling the output. And adding logistics costs. So it's a tradeoff between those things mostly.


[24-Sep-24 02:29 AM] realharvey#0000
workforce cons is about 63 AIC per unit of AL if you buy at CX prices


[24-Sep-24 02:30 AM] evov#0000
So after workforce costs it's 52k per day roughly I guess.


[24-Sep-24 02:46 AM] evov#0000
Rough info on cashflow (again, using a smelter base on Deimos making AL as the example )
Shipping - Need a 2k2k ship to drop this off every 3days roughly.  ( or starter ship making a trip more than once per day )
1020 ALO, 170 O, 170 C, 170 FLX -> 333k AIC

So by the time you buy it, ship it, process it ship it back and sell it etc, you're looking at around half a mil tied up in stock, and another (roughly) 1mil worth of shipping capital committed to supply it.

It's that capital cost, early in the game, which slows down growth for people. That's the main reason I feel like this sort of thing has benefits. Other than that, it's just moving small bits of margin from one plate to another which is kinda zero sum and (to me) uninteresting.


[24-Sep-24 03:38 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Morning all.

I have a base on Harmonia that i have focused on Ration production, making water inhouse.
7 Food processors, 7 Farms, 8 Rigs.
Ballpark 35000 profit.

If i remove the 8 rigs and replace with 2 more farms, and 2 more food processors, then i'm looking at 40000 profit, a healthy increase!

Wondering if 5k is worth shipping all that water once a week. With fuel costs, the increase is marginal, 2-3000.

[24-Sep-24 05:22 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Break even prices for production are 510 AIC per AL (at 0 days from base build), and 486 AIC per AL (~45 days from base build), assuming best case scenario (Inputs.BID.AI1 + Outputs.ASK.AI1). The wrought price volume of said inputs is 408 AIC per AL, with the wrought price volume of said outputs is 840 AIC per AL, yielding a 2:1 profitable production ratio. You already said this part...

The operational costs (Repairs + consumables) runs down to 79 AIC per AL, so you're looking at a revenue stream of ~145k AIC daily, to divy up between the contractual parties, to such an arrangement. 

At an overall base price of ~1mil AIC, I'd say just throw up the build costs, to be included as a inverse coefficient of final price, based on base age, up to 90 days, or less. That should give enough incentive for anyone wishing to take you up on such arrangements, to be a rather easy, and almost painless decision, provided that such people have PRO. Basics are doable, but they have manual ques to setup, and without STO use, their base inventories might entirely overflow, if not handled properly.

That being said, there's also a consideration on repair intervals (not too many people read into the maths). I'm sure you'd give a rough overview to any interested, with the explicit recommendation that those participating would repair every 45 days, as compared to the usual 90. The program would be losing a grand total of 1/3 of a day of production volumes, every 90 days, as opposed to the usual 3.5 production days.


[24-Sep-24 05:24 AM] evov#0000
You're making 145k/day on a base making AL? Thats very intersting.


[24-Sep-24 05:25 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Like you said, most of the capital required is in the inputs... Assuming null, that's the overall volume of potential revenues.


[24-Sep-24 05:25 AM] evov#0000
And the only reason you think AL is worth 840 AIC at the moment is because I bought 50mil worth of it on the weekend. üôÇ

Lots of assumptions with FIO data. Those assumptions shouldn't be taken as "guarantees", since all they really are just spot values for current market conditions. Of course, I don't deal with the metals. If this was an agribusiness discussion, I'd be able to confer whether such ideas would be more, or less realistic. üòõ


[24-Sep-24 05:31 AM] evov#0000
"Best case scenario" - good luck with that. You're buying at bids and selling at ask... that means there's MORE time that capital gets tied up as you're waiting for those bids/asks to maybe fill maybe not. The whole point of the offer/exercise is to make new players MORE capital efficient, not less. To take them from 1 base to 2. 2 bases to 3 etc as quickly as possible.


[24-Sep-24 05:35 AM] evov#0000

Because ship capital is one of those limiting factors for new players. A full smelter base like that would tie up one of their starter shiper perminantly, and greatly limit expansion options imo.


[24-Sep-24 05:40 AM] evov#0000
So shipping to supply / return would be about 25-30 per AL is the practical cost of that by the sounds of it.


[24-Sep-24 07:16 AM] tanda#0000
it certainly does until you get your first WCB


[24-Sep-24 07:16 AM] tanda#0000
or you can do like I did and outsource ALO entirely to the LM


[24-Sep-24 07:16 AM] tanda#0000
which worked out pretty great for me, still doing that


[24-Sep-24 02:38 PM] kynadre#0000
the smartest thing new players can do is look for good to produce that make a profit, but have way closer buy/sell prices so it's not "so much of a loss" mentally to get the quicker money to inject back into their base, I think


[24-Sep-24 02:38 PM] kynadre#0000
idk, it really depends on people needing what they're making


[24-Sep-24 02:38 PM] kynadre#0000
everyone's going to make AL as their first thing since it's the metallurgist start, after all


[24-Sep-24 02:43 PM] kynadre#0000
plus the last two contracts give you enough BSE and MCG for more extractors, steering players towards "you should keep building these and making more AL"


[24-Sep-24 09:55 PM] tanda#0000
Is STL super ~~undervalued ~~ low on demand/high on supply right now?

./shrug. I use it for making VG / WIN / ADR and ETC. And have about 7000 of it across the planets that use it. The markets could run completely dry for all I care haha. But I'll start making some more shortly if people really need it.

[25-Sep-24 12:10 AM] evov#0000
Actually, that's only like 2-300 REA.


[25-Sep-24 12:14 AM] getonthetrain#0000
yea, the amount and size of BRM is limiting


[25-Sep-24 12:17 AM] evov#0000
REA shortage really only affects people making ships or people with SCI level pops to support. Anyone doing either of those things has more than enough $ behind them to sort out solutions.
When I see RAT or DW skyrocket, I'll turn the 4 CX's upside down to find a solution to keep that in check ( or if AL is so cheap that all the new players we shoehorn into smelting it are getting screwed ). But problems that are really only problems for well established players.. kinda falls into "not my problem" territory.

It's a First in, First Out method of cyclical production... It's an average, in other words... Some days you might have more BEA/GRN orders than NUTs... On others you will have more orders for NUTs than anything else.

Going for vertical integration is always an advantage. Makes you more protected from market shifts


[28-Sep-24 04:56 AM] evov#0000
There's up and downs. But one of the benefits to vertical integration, is you need to hold onto less stock. If you build/design your production chains such that each step produces slightly more than the next step needs, you never need to worry about running out of an input.


[28-Sep-24 04:58 AM] evov#0000
The down side is that you're very "locked in" you end up with a large number of bases that are all integrally connected. So it can be more difficult to make changes in the future if you want to go in a different direction later.

When you place a market order, how can you amend the order?
Want to try my hand at some market trading.
Is that a done thing?


[30-Sep-24 04:09 AM] razenpok#0000
You can delete your order from CXOS, and then create a new one

as always, bouncing up and down with excitement to build up the funds to figure out what's next


[30-Sep-24 10:23 PM] tanda#0000
you might consider doing a sponsored base next just to jumpstart your empire while your permits are cheap


[30-Sep-24 10:24 PM] kynadre#0000
sponsored?


[30-Sep-24 10:24 PM] tanda#0000
someone else pays for you to run a base for them, feeds you inputs and you sell back the outputs to them for around ~50k income per day for the base


[30-Sep-24 10:28 PM] tanda#0000
That, or as a PRO player, you could apply for a loan from one of the major banks and use that to jumpstart the next phase of expansion


[30-Sep-24 10:39 PM] kynadre#0000
huh, interesting


[30-Sep-24 10:41 PM] kynadre#0000
I know it'll take a few bases for me to be able to afford and justify ship upgrades


[30-Sep-24 10:42 PM] tanda#0000
ehh, hopefully not as long as you think


[30-Sep-24 10:42 PM] tanda#0000
I know there are some loan options that were being considered as part of the Ship Kit Project


[30-Sep-24 10:48 PM] kynadre#0000
gotcha


[30-Sep-24 10:48 PM] kynadre#0000
and I've tried to keep my ships busy hauling as supplemental income


[30-Sep-24 10:49 PM] tanda#0000
that's definitely a good idea


[30-Sep-24 10:49 PM] tanda#0000
Do you have any idea what you want to do next?


[30-Sep-24 11:18 PM] kynadre#0000
Well, I can't go for a 2nd AL extraction base or an H extraction base without upgraded haulers


[30-Sep-24 11:19 PM] kynadre#0000
I'm thinking about my own production chain and what contributes, what's needed


[01-Oct-24 12:29 AM] saltymaggot#0000
I get the more common way nowadays is to use permits for next bases not to expand the current one?


[01-Oct-24 12:30 AM] saltymaggot#0000
Getting more area behalf of logistical headache.


[01-Oct-24 12:32 AM] getonthetrain#0000
You can play however you want


[01-Oct-24 12:33 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Just the first permit gives you 500 area, and if you expand to another planet you get another 500 area. But on the same planet that permit only gives you 250


[01-Oct-24 12:33 AM] getonthetrain#0000
But if you want to play tall, that's up to you


[01-Oct-24 01:23 AM] saltymaggot#0000
Every new permit is double the cost?


[01-Oct-24 01:27 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Not sure of the amount of increase, but it certainly gets more and more expensive


[01-Oct-24 01:29 AM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs not exactly a double in cost to get the next permit


[01-Oct-24 02:05 AM] realharvey#0000
HQ Upgrades (For permit increase) will get really high. My next upgrade to 22 costs 10.000.000 AIC and more. Wasting a permit on just a bit more area is going to cost a lot in the long run


[01-Oct-24 02:05 AM] realharvey#0000
In the "early" game. It can be beneficial to keep logistics easy


[01-Oct-24 03:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Also, permits can be revoked form planets later, if you decide to use it for a new base


[01-Oct-24 04:46 AM] saltymaggot#0000
Copy


[01-Oct-24 04:46 AM] saltymaggot#0000
How many planets are you realistically managing?
And how many spaceships one could expect at this point in the game?


[01-Oct-24 04:47 AM] saltymaggot#0000
I assume there is no limit how many spaceships you can own?


[01-Oct-24 04:56 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It sorta is "double" the cost, per new permit via HQ upgrades.... and sorta isn't(   https://pct.fnar.net/hq/   ). You will start noticing the heavy costs when you're up to 21 permits, and want another one.

It is much less noticeable, if all of your bases are making like 70k profits daily (PIO/SET production), and you manage to sell it all on the CX by the end of the week, though.


[01-Oct-24 05:15 AM] evov#0000
You can check out the leader board in game  ( open a buffer and type "lead") you can look at all sorts of information. One of them - is how many ships people have ->   Every time I look Darkfuel has a couple more than the last time I looked.

Of course, they won't be accepting whatever low ball offers you advertise on the CX LM markets, since 1) they have a high-bar of ROI requirements, and 2) there is competition.

Nice, so a few more rigs, a couple more farmsteads and I'm set


[02-Oct-24 05:17 PM] igfloz#0000
...although, I should say I benefited from another player buying all my GRN. I'd look for these kind of partnerships that can benefit you. The CX market for agri can be slow


[02-Oct-24 05:17 PM] igfloz#0000
Harmonia right ?


[02-Oct-24 05:17 PM] sleep_unique#0000
Yeaa


[02-Oct-24 05:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
Farmers are a bit underpayed right now since people grow their own stuff


[02-Oct-24 05:18 PM] sleep_unique#0000
I got a lil welcome to harmonia from prodigus but I wasn't able to find them to ping them a thank you


[02-Oct-24 05:18 PM] igfloz#0000
ok... Im gonna suggest that rigs might not be worth it on Harmonia. Overall it will be more efficient to buy H2O from the CX and transport


[02-Oct-24 05:19 PM] sleep_unique#0000

[02-Oct-24 05:21 PM] igfloz#0000
RAT always sells - but its how efficiently you make the RAT - I'd argue that FRM & RAT on the same base is in-efficient

[02-Oct-24 05:26 PM] sleep_unique#0000
FRM as in farmstead right? As in ship in the raw mat for RAT and the needs for the workers and pivot to having just food processors?


[02-Oct-24 05:26 PM] sleep_unique#0000
Sorry I'm just getting to grips with the acronyms


[02-Oct-24 05:27 PM] marat_sh#0000
also if you are not sure what we are talking about type "mat RAT" in buffer It will give you item description


[02-Oct-24 05:28 PM] marat_sh#0000
if it's a building type "bui FRM"


[02-Oct-24 05:28 PM] sleep_unique#0000
gotcha, I just went through base buildings to find it, I'm not up on the commands yet


[02-Oct-24 05:29 PM] marat_sh#0000
you will get used to it üòÖ It's faster then doing multiple clicks


[02-Oct-24 05:30 PM] igfloz#0000
yeah, FRM is a farm, FP is a food processor. Each planet has a cogc bonus (Harmonia bonus is Agricuture (FRM)) - another planet would have a bonus for FP - Having both on harmonia would lose you any bonus for FP, same for RIG (rigs for water - they come under resource extraction bonus)


[02-Oct-24 05:31 PM] sleep_unique#0000
Okay so how viable do you reckon just doing FRM would be, would make sense to capitalise on the bonus


[02-Oct-24 05:32 PM] marat_sh#0000
try to use buildings from the COGC bonus. Later when you have money you can "ignore" that rule


[02-Oct-24 05:33 PM] marat_sh#0000
how many FRMs do you have right now?

it's a long term profit kinda game, you won't "win" anything by Friday....... You WILL need ship upgrades............. I appreciate that your ships will be moving, but that is gonna cost you fuel, which does have a long term impact on your bottom line

not really costing Just not making money


[02-Oct-24 06:13 PM] sleep_unique#0000
Well yea I was thinking if it was stored in a warehouse


[02-Oct-24 06:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
You will have to bring it to CX though


[02-Oct-24 06:13 PM] marat_sh#0000

[02-Oct-24 06:14 PM] marat_sh#0000
there is 100 BID orders for RCO at 1500/u


[02-Oct-24 06:14 PM] marat_sh#0000

[02-Oct-24 06:18 PM] marat_sh#0000
but only 130 RCO


[02-Oct-24 06:19 PM] sleep_unique#0000
Ahh


[02-Oct-24 06:19 PM] marat_sh#0000
if you wanna do a long game you can sell it at ASK at your own price BUT it will be slower depending how strong the need for RCO


[02-Oct-24 06:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
as a reference last price for RCO was 1200/u


[02-Oct-24 06:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
That what I bought it for


[02-Oct-24 06:20 PM] marat_sh#0000
so this person is paying more then the last price


[02-Oct-24 06:20 PM] sleep_unique#0000
Even if avg drops it's still dependable selling to you


[02-Oct-24 06:21 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah if you sell all 130 to them You ever need to wait for more BIDs or Set at ASK


[02-Oct-24 06:21 PM] getonthetrain#0000
RCO and HERB will always find a nice market of buyers

[03-Oct-24 08:07 PM] jcheung#0000
well. you could also feed off FIO too


[03-Oct-24 08:08 PM] jcheung#0000
but yeah, you could also hardcode consumption, knowing it's gonna be a little off


[03-Oct-24 08:08 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, FIO is the best way to obtain data right? and it updates only when I load the inventory in my viewport right?


[03-Oct-24 08:08 PM] jcheung#0000
pretty much


[03-Oct-24 08:09 PM] manhim#0000
I was thinking more about hard coding my base setup and logistics, but using FIO's numbers


[03-Oct-24 08:09 PM] jcheung#0000
FIO does actually give you base layout


[03-Oct-24 08:09 PM] jcheung#0000
whether or not it's useful to you is another story


[03-Oct-24 08:10 PM] manhim#0000
I haven't looked at what's available with FIO that much outside of market data for my sheets

I wanted to make a BMP base, but run it inventory-based rather than just queueing the same things over and over. I could probably make something to automate my logistical needs based timeframes and calculate optimal ways to queue each productions.

honest question here, why isn't Antares II Vulcan more inhabited as a FEO EXT? It's practically empty, and other than the pressure I see no reason why it isn't full, given its proximity to Deimos and ANT


[07-Oct-24 06:45 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's for the same reason, that Pallada, being a FP COGC right on MOR CX, isn't more inhabited. HSE + INS added construction costs, along with its generally off the beaten path of new-bro **"firsties"**, being their first 1-3 bases. It's a very long-term game, and Vulcan was only recently started up as an interesting planet to develop, ohh idk, like 6-12 months ago?

[07-Oct-24 06:47 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, more like just over 2 years ago... But you're starting to get more peeps interested, which is why it's at ~90 bases, rather than like 1-10 bases.

They basically let you buy materials and load a ship to resupply a base or repair a base in a more automated fashion - it does all the math and fills out all the CXPO and MTRA buffers, all you need to do is click buy and transfer a lot. Welcome back üôÇ

This is how the typical resupply ends up looking - a 'Material Group' for the planet at the top that tells the script what to buy and how much, and then CX Buy / MTRA actions assigned to that group


[07-Oct-24 08:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
you'll need a CXPO window for every thing you buy and an MTRA window open to actually execute it

I've done that for project-based management, but I'm not 100% satisfied. You just need to update the "Want" column and everything is generated automatically through queries with the help of other data sheets.

I'm thinking about coding something that generates a list of action items with a dependency system rather than that to make easier to run multiple projects in parallel. But I also feel like I'm going to over-engineer this ü§î .

I love it. I have a "stockpile" sheet that works kinda like that. I just set the 'want' value to whatever my target stockpile is for a material on a specific planet, and it checks that value against my FIO inventory and gives me a report of what is needed and where. Super useful in the few areas where XIT BURN isn't enough. Like keeping stocks of material that aren't for production like fuel.


[09-Oct-24 11:48 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Can also be used to track what I have for sale and where


[09-Oct-24 12:02 PM] manhim#0000
Yeah, right now I'm cleaning my sheet up and plugging many FIO API endpoints to automate even more stuff. Currently scratching my head because I'm working an a recursive algorithm so that I can easily manage recipes that are required from recipes from other locations (Right now it's very ad-hoc and won't scale - or will take my sanity away to maintain as I grow).

But, right now, my goal is to write up a list of wants, have it spew a project in the form of a checklist, then have a way to copy-paste that checklist in a "master" checklist where I can put multiple projects into.

I'm thinking about having 2 project types for now: Resupply and Production.

Resupply will basically take all info (a kind of snapshot) from the inventory API endpoints and will find anything that's in the yellow or red (Defined manually), then will add stock (buy) + transport tasks to it's list of tasks that I will be able to copy.

Production will be the "wants" stuff where it will create 3 types of tasks: stock (buy) + transport + produce (+ transport intermediates + produce intermediates).


[09-Oct-24 12:02 PM] manhim#0000
And probably a 3rd-4th one for base building and base repairs.


[09-Oct-24 12:21 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I use in-game buffers for consumable resupplies... For production supplies, I just learn some min limits. For repairs, I repair every 45 days, so I'll need to use 1/4 of my production building construction costs, as a general rule.

Your spreadsheet time is best used for production mapping/pricing. Your time is limited. No need to waste effort on stuff that has several redundancies, via basic maths.


[09-Oct-24 12:23 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
There's also PMMG Extended, which cuts down on alot of that maths, if you play via browser.


[09-Oct-24 03:42 PM] mancules#0000
New to PrUn, looking at expanding my starter base. Currently, have 1 O2 collector, 1 ALO extractor, and 2 smelters making AL. Just playing around with how I can expand, make it more self sufficient and of course turn a bigger profit. What is considered a good ROI on investments into infrastructure like this? From what I've messed with I've been sitting around a 40-45 day ROI, seems like it could be long but then again we're playing PU but my other hang up is I'd only be increasing profits by a few thousand a day

[09-Oct-24 03:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
Getting your own ALO helps a lot with logistics since you will be smelting it where you getting it... and it's pretty heavy if you gonna outsource it or scale


[09-Oct-24 03:47 PM] marat_sh#0000
try not to overproduce ALO and use as much as you consuming it since most of your income will come from AL then ALO


[09-Oct-24 03:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
You can also mix in Si / Li / Ti


[09-Oct-24 03:48 PM] marat_sh#0000
they sell at higher price then AL but with less demand


[09-Oct-24 03:49 PM] marat_sh#0000
but you would need to source the ore for them


[09-Oct-24 03:50 PM] marat_sh#0000
also O2 is not that expansive so you can drop O2 collector and replace it with more SME


[09-Oct-24 03:51 PM] igfloz#0000
I do OK with selling ALO to preferred buyers. I have only just strted smelting small amounts of AL myself


[09-Oct-24 03:52 PM] igfloz#0000
...and I'd argue that there are many buyers who would commit to buying ALO at a "good" price


[09-Oct-24 03:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
Correct... A lot of people have their own extractors for ALO, but they could drop them if ALO is cheap enough to just expand the production


[09-Oct-24 03:53 PM] marat_sh#0000
but problem with logistics still there


[09-Oct-24 03:55 PM] igfloz#0000
WCB for the win..... thats the 1st thing I went for.... bigger ship (but, there was also the opportunity back then) -  Hope we get the PSK to run properly for others to take advantage


[09-Oct-24 04:55 PM] mancules#0000
I gotcha, I played around with the PrUn a bit more, and focused a build just on producing AL, this looks a lot more lucrative than what I was doing before. Is focusing a whole base like this solely on manufacturing a basic metal a good idea and then expanding onto another base to further refine it into goods or would y'all just leave it be and sell off all the AL?


[09-Oct-24 05:02 PM] marat_sh#0000
You can use our own AL for production yourself Most of it will go into construction category


[09-Oct-24 05:19 PM] mancules#0000
I figured for a start producing a good amount of AL and then moving into refining some of it into SI. There's a good demand/supply for SI at Antares and the supplies I'd need. Eventually I'd further expand, maybe into those constructions or find a use for the SI but it'll be a hot minute before I have that kind of money, this is my PrUn sheet if anyone wants to see, it's pretty basic though https://prunplanner.org/shared/bc937fd0-de49-4aec-ace0-d2518c81ec30

[11-Oct-24 11:57 AM] manhim#0000
So, all those tasks are automatically generated from my Wants column of the project. I separated Buying from Provisioning so that I could merge my buy tasks together easily without losing trace of what I need to provision and for which project. Tasks also keeps track of what is blocking what, so I can create a view that hides every blocked tasks so I can focus on what I can do right now.

The tasks are copied from a summary sheet (that I'm still working on) so that I can work on multiple projects in parallel easily. That summary sheet will calculate the project's margin, total profits, profits per days and provide other stats (like tonnage/volume of transports between each planets, etc.).

Each recipes can be assigned to a different base and it will automatically add the related transport tasks. It could also technically support production projects from multiple people, though it's a bit out of scope of my needs right now.

And the only reason I did it in Google Sheets is because I was too lazy to make a front-end.

[15-Oct-24 08:09 PM] kynadre#0000

[15-Oct-24 08:09 PM] kynadre#0000

Well, gateways will just become available for people to build. That wouldn't need a reset necessarily. But I assume they'd get removed on a reset, same as like population infrastructure or anything else

If they had spare water to throw at the 1440 bid... sure, they could do that, post a new bid at 50.1

But then someone can post at 50.2 etc etc. So a lot of it comes down to time. What's the probability my order will be filled within X amount of time.

[17-Oct-24 07:45 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I just wanted to defend my point and run the calculations, but underestimated how much the difference adds up on a 10,000 unit order.
Buying for ask they would have payed 586,818 AIC, while with his bid offer they will pay 561,000 AIC.
To put this in perspective: that‚Äôs a difference of 25,818 AIC or approx 4.4 %


[17-Oct-24 07:46 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Which is in my opinion still not that much, relative to the volume, but sure is money you can safe, if you have the time.


[17-Oct-24 07:52 AM] evov#0000
With all the ask/bid tradeoffs, time is the big unknown. How long will it take for respective orders to fill. How long is it worth having that much cash tied up to make 4.4%


[17-Oct-24 08:25 AM] manhim#0000
Also, if the ask prices rise before you could complete the order, you're stuck paying even more if you stretch it too much.


[17-Oct-24 08:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
My reasoning is often - if everybody is gonna sit on his money, then the market is never going to move


[17-Oct-24 08:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
So I often only setup a bid, if I really don‚Äôt need the materials asap and/or the spread is relatively high

I was planning on getting into this.
Make a small supply, maybe 20 units a day, enough to satisfy demand while not saturating the market


[19-Oct-24 03:42 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Then this feckin eejit comes along and guts the whole thing.


[19-Oct-24 03:42 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Why, why did he have to do that


[19-Oct-24 03:42 AM] cruelcoin#0000
He's not going to sell any faster at 15k than he was going to at 18k?


[19-Oct-24 03:43 AM] laaxus#0000
and that's where you're wrong


[19-Oct-24 03:43 AM] cruelcoin#0000
Mmm?


[19-Oct-24 03:43 AM] laaxus#0000
people would rather produce themselves than buy overpriced


[19-Oct-24 03:43 AM] laaxus#0000
sell it at a fair, market price, and you'll sell


[19-Oct-24 03:44 AM] laaxus#0000
sell it overpriced, and you can be sure no one will buy it from you, for long

I still have a lot of WIN saved up. I'm in no rush to sell.


[19-Oct-24 03:45 AM] laaxus#0000
furthermore, you can't overprice a commodity with high volume


[19-Oct-24 03:45 AM] laaxus#0000
because, that would be a literal money print, so the market would adapt pretty fast


[19-Oct-24 03:45 AM] laaxus#0000
if you see a market opportunity that is too good to be true, it probably is

What if. . . .  the price of all the inputs also went up sharply in price? Then you could probably overprice something for a while before production catches up.


[19-Oct-24 03:47 AM] laaxus#0000
if the price of the inputs goes down, and the ouput price goes down (but less) you mean ?


[19-Oct-24 03:47 AM] cruelcoin#0000
I just saw a commodity that was on the up and up for a long time, with daily sales volume in excess of what i was planning to produce, so i wasn't going to saturate it.
But yeah, does seem too good to be true.
Could hardly have expected 90k daily profit from a 350k base.....

or, rather, don't expect it not to be risky


[19-Oct-24 03:50 AM] evov#0000
You would need to buy the ingredients, or make them. Making them adds a bit more time before you can finaly produce WIN. Buying them... well, not sure how much you plan on making, but I'd advise you check the amount available / price of the inputs before making plans with your base.


[19-Oct-24 03:51 AM] laaxus#0000
Recently, I saw an opportunity and build a NFI base, and for a month I produced more than the rest of the universe combined
I did good money, but I knew it wouldn't last so now I'll have to change the base.
I wouldn't have made good money if anybody else took that bet, it was VERY risky
Once again, it's all betting and edging

I'm struggling as to what to do over in SE-110.

My original plan was to build a coffee/booze empire.
Water base on 110c is full.

I had intended to do Hydroponics on 110b and Fermentor's on 110a.
But the Hydro doesn't make anything that i can use to make booze in the fermentors.
And turns out, coffee production is very low profit.

Zero fertility in 110 has me thinking i need to just move to a better system elsewhere for my booze hub, and just leave the water base standing solo.


[19-Oct-24 03:55 AM] evov#0000
It hasn't broken yet. But... I'm hoping it pushed all the way to 20k/u before I dump what I got.


[19-Oct-24 03:56 AM] laaxus#0000
don't forget that many players have litteraly hundreds of millions of commodities stock


[19-Oct-24 03:56 AM] laaxus#0000
so, for the market to really meaningfully change price, those stock have to go down


[19-Oct-24 03:56 AM] laaxus#0000

[19-Oct-24 03:57 AM] cruelcoin#0000

[19-Oct-24 03:57 AM] laaxus#0000
sometimes, some rich guys like to buy millions at once (*hum* @evov  *hum*)
Doesn't mean there's a long terme opportunity


[19-Oct-24 03:58 AM] evov#0000
I don't know what you're talking about. Sometimes a guy just feels the need to build a WIN cellar in one of his space ships.

FRMs are very low logistics, their location doesn't really matter in relation to the rest of your operations

COF production has been quite profitable for me - are you sourcing some materials from the CX?

...as long as it's not something silly like kinza lmao


[19-Oct-24 02:18 PM] sidepipe#0000
Or is it just low profit compared to other things you could be making in FPs? I use the 30 day average prices on prunplanner and COF has a quite good ROI

well, FPs are a bit worse on SE-110a because of the INS. you save in logistics, but you pay in INS üòÑ

so @cruelcoin  - a better step forward might be to start with FPs on Norwick and then expand from there, if you'd still like to do COF / RATs etc and are worried about profits on 110a

Phobos, Deimos and Harmonia are the starter planets in ANT?

correct


[03-Nov-24 01:40 PM] pxlfox.#0000
can it be, that I can't post on planets I don't have a base on?


[03-Nov-24 01:41 PM] tanda#0000
yes, that is the case


[03-Nov-24 01:41 PM] tanda#0000
I need a base on Phobos to have all the bases covered

when i finish the tutorials i will share my business plan to get that juicy milion, so far i just built a basic carbon factory in harmony, i want to try to do mostly trading if possible, set buy orders and sell orders but while also building a not too complicated industry


[11-Nov-24 06:38 AM] guillejejexdd#0000
so yea i guess i need to figure out the best way to expand my industry


[11-Nov-24 06:39 AM] laaxus#0000
to trade, you need capital, which you don't have


[11-Nov-24 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
you should build bases to get the capital you need to trade, if that's the path you wish to take


[11-Nov-24 06:43 AM] guillejejexdd#0000
yea


[11-Nov-24 06:44 AM] guillejejexdd#0000
so thats what i meant by expanding my industry


[11-Nov-24 06:44 AM] guillejejexdd#0000
not sure how to expand it without overcomplicate it i guess i will figure out while doing the tutorial


[11-Nov-24 06:44 AM] guillejejexdd#0000
now i have 2 habitat 2 farm and 1 incinerator, next i will build water rig


[11-Nov-24 08:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
@tanda I think YK-266c (BRM->REA) should be Recourse extraction COGC instead of Chem.


[11-Nov-24 08:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
You can fit more CHP in exchange of less extractors


[11-Nov-24 08:40 AM] marat_sh#0000
and you get more REA output


[11-Nov-24 08:41 AM] tanda#0000
No, ran the numbers already before we set up. Considered pioneer cogc as well

well with chem COGC you have more REA ( a bit more ) but with BRM deficit


[11-Nov-24 08:46 AM] tanda#0000
Single permits are a bit rough overall. You either need two permits on a base or a partner

1 permit

If you are okay doing alot of personal cons or LM cons you should be able to find plenty who will buy your C on Nascent and you dont need to move it to ANT


[13-Nov-24 02:17 PM] finestone#0000
mixing half BMP for PE could help eat some carbon and reduce output transport but then you are conducting COGC sin

[13-Nov-24 05:57 PM] realharvey#0000
you should definitly consider adding 1 Storage


[13-Nov-24 05:57 PM] tyrandia#0000
Okay.


[13-Nov-24 05:57 PM] realharvey#0000
your base only has 1500/1500


[13-Nov-24 05:57 PM] realharvey#0000
and C is very heavy and takes up lots of space


[13-Nov-24 05:57 PM] tyrandia#0000
Right.


[13-Nov-24 05:57 PM] realharvey#0000
A STO (Storage) adds 5000/5000


[13-Nov-24 05:57 PM] tyrandia#0000
Awesome!

[13-Nov-24 05:58 PM] realharvey#0000
yeah for a reasonable price


[13-Nov-24 05:58 PM] tyrandia#0000
Sounds great. ‚ù§Ô∏è


[13-Nov-24 06:00 PM] realharvey#0000
prices for C have gone up quite a bit. It currently sits at 1000/u


[13-Nov-24 06:00 PM] realharvey#0000
I am not going to pay that price üòÖ  But once it comes down anyway, I'll take it for 750 or I might havee to adjust my pricing to make 800/u work


[13-Nov-24 06:01 PM] tyrandia#0000
I can supply at lower than market price as long as I'm turning a decent profit at the end of the day.


[13-Nov-24 06:02 PM] realharvey#0000
you can always try to ship most of your stuff to the CX yourself and sell the rest of your stock too me when you cant keep up :)

[13-Nov-24 06:21 PM] tyrandia#0000
I plan on getting a small loan as well

A small sidenote regarding single STO's on INC bases: It gets really tight if you try to do more than single/double burn


[13-Nov-24 06:55 PM] tyrandia#0000
Gotcha.


[13-Nov-24 06:55 PM] tyrandia#0000
So, more storage to expand into, got it.


[13-Nov-24 06:57 PM] marat_sh#0000
if you want less frequent visits, you probably might want to rent a warehouse or get second STO


[13-Nov-24 07:06 PM] tyrandia#0000
Warehouse makes sense.


[13-Nov-24 07:08 PM] marat_sh#0000
yeah, fees are not that expansive and you don't have to sacrifice INC for area


[13-Nov-24 07:09 PM] finestone#0000
yeah buy up all warehouses they very cheap


[13-Nov-24 07:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
main down side you would need manually transfer items from base INV to ware INV


[13-Nov-24 07:13 PM] marat_sh#0000
unless there is an easier way that I am not aware of


[13-Nov-24 07:14 PM] tanda#0000
nope, that's about it. A little bit of micro-management


[14-Nov-24 08:05 AM] realharvey#0000
putting export goods into a warehouse is very okay amount of extra management. And this is coming from someone that finds a lot of tasks tedious üòÇ


[14-Nov-24 08:49 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I use the PMMG custom inventory sorting then group materials by their export location.

[17-Nov-24 07:29 AM] evov#0000
Why don't people load up their base with all the consumes needed to last the duration of the repair interval. So you only need to do 1 resupply run every 45/60/90 days whatever cycle you run.

I'm guessing choices and decisions are a reflection of the information presented to people by the tools that they use.


[17-Nov-24 07:30 AM] laaxus#0000
because it divides your roi by a third roughly ?


[17-Nov-24 07:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Gonna skip the recruitment message this week and gonna post one next week. There seemed not much action this week and a lot of the joins did find there way here


[17-Nov-24 07:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Because I don‚Äôt have the money to stock for 30 days ü´†


[17-Nov-24 07:32 AM] evov#0000
So what do you do? Squeeze in a handfull of rats each trip you send inputs to the base?


[17-Nov-24 07:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Having weekly restock trips with inputs and consumables until we can afford a month of consumables


[17-Nov-24 07:34 AM] laaxus#0000
I stock 20 days worth of supplies (consummables), 10 days of production input goods


[17-Nov-24 07:35 AM] evov#0000
But you'd do 20 days worth of ALL the supplies right? So running out of just PT seems a bit odd.


[17-Nov-24 07:35 AM] laaxus#0000
I messed up


[17-Nov-24 07:35 AM] laaxus#0000
I somehow forgot to buy pt


[17-Nov-24 07:39 AM] evov#0000
Fair enough. Well, if you need more ships to keep up with deliveries .. I might know a guy üôÇ


[17-Nov-24 07:40 AM] laaxus#0000
I might have to buy a 2k/2k ships in a month or two, so who knows ? üôÇ


[17-Nov-24 08:59 AM] marat_sh#0000
it depends on the cash you have on hand. first few weeks i was resupplying daily. After that for 4-6 days. Now 100 days in... I resupply every 2 weeks.


[17-Nov-24 09:00 AM] marat_sh#0000
at some point people will get where you are when you resupply on repair cycles


[17-Nov-24 09:45 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I dont even pay attention to repair cycles üòÖ Most of my base repairs happened on a whim


[17-Nov-24 09:46 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
One of my bases is in need of repairs asap but i couldn't be bothered to send a ship üòÖ


[17-Nov-24 09:46 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
I stock my bases with 60 day consumables


[17-Nov-24 09:47 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
For inputs it really depends on how bulky they are. fuel inputs can never be stored in large quantities due to how many STOs I will need so they get shipped frequently while other inputs are just stocked (for eg metallurgy stuff like C and O)


[17-Nov-24 09:47 AM] optimizedfunction#0000
(I hate restocking cons, especially higher tiers)


[17-Nov-24 11:34 PM] evov#0000
For me in the early days - I found that the biggest hurdle to growth was managing shipping time. Shipping capacity was a major bottleneck. The idea of needing to squeeze in an extra couple trips to a planet to cover consumes/repairs at an inopportune time was crazy talk from my perspective.

I guess now ships are a lot more available, loans are a lot more available, so that angle is a lot less relevant ( less relevant ... not irrelevant though imo) . I still can't recommend enough, just for your own sanity, when you can afford it - eat the extra set up cost for the base at the start and enjoy the reduced logistical and cognitive load for rest of the bases life.


[17-Nov-24 11:37 PM] evov#0000
To put the shipping constraints into perspective - I'd get up for work early (at 4am) to squeeze in a few extra shipping trips. Now... I go to sleep with empty ships sitting at the CX and be like.... meh, tomorrow's problem haha.

[23-Nov-24 02:07 PM] laaxus#0000
H2O is actually quite hard to ship, so if people are using 90% of their shipping capacity, they probably can't switch to full DW production


[23-Nov-24 02:09 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Makes sense. Also I thought you might have to compete with all the other producers - so keeping your orders in shape all the time to get stuff sold

i'm at 19 and I pivot fairly regularly. especially with chemistry bases it's fairly easy to switch back and forth

I've been meaning to abandon my halcyon base for a long time but the price of HAL goes up every time I decide to finally do it (and makes it worthwhile to keep the base a little longer)


[23-Nov-24 02:22 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm building a new base in halcyon right now

sweet, everyone should crash the price of HAL so I can finally abandon that base üòõ


[23-Nov-24 02:22 PM] sidepipe#0000

jokes aside though, it's a chain worth integrating imo

Honestly, it's TOO much more profitable to not do it


[23-Nov-24 02:25 PM] laaxus#0000
this makes 5 bases profitable, while just relying on cx makes it harder

Hardly worth it for just FEO. I think Kiruna + Libertas is the better option, and close enough


[23-Nov-24 03:50 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Its a pain. I have like 14 bases and most of it is dedicated to SF. If I want to even optimise anything, it takes uprooting bases and shipping not only all the building mats but also the inventory.


[23-Nov-24 03:51 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
Repairs are a pain too


[23-Nov-24 04:06 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Ahh yes, SF. It's not like  I haven't seen people running Fuel Refining operations on non-COGC matching planets... (I have)... It's just a long-term planning thing. 

It's also a strategy thing. You can have good fuel processes running on a CX-adjacent planet, and only really need to use STLs for the I/Os of the fuel jobs. GEN MCBs are nice for those, at min burns, but you'd need to overbuild for that.

But that's like a 6-->12 month project on its own, and I think that I'm the only person really using those outdated ship designs. Everyone else is on the FSE/QCR models or something like it, if they can't spare HQ permits for shipbuilding.

[23-Nov-24 07:23 PM] evov#0000
Really depends on the base and what it makes, how well integrated it is into your other production, how "replaceable" that production is from the CX.

The cost of doing so, isn't massive. You lose a little bit of money on having to rebuild habs. You lose a bit in lost production having to wait for new pop, having to wait for new experts etc. So there is definitely a cost associated with relocating a permit. But it shouldn't stop you from swapping production over from something that's meaningfully more profitable.


[23-Nov-24 09:28 PM] optimizedfunction#0000
I would never run a base without CoGC when permits are so expensive. Its cheaper for me to build and maintain a CoGC than get a new permit üòÖ

If anyone wants to use, here is my python script to pull price data from ANT (for spreadsheets and stuffs).

You can change it however you'd like to fit your use-case.

```python
import requests
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Enter tickers here:

brackets = {
    "Sell": ["AL"],  # Display Bid price
    "Buy": ["O", "FLX", "H2O", "COF", "DW", "RAT", "OVE", "PWO"]  # Display Ask price
}
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def cx(ticker):
    url = f"https://rest.fnar.net/exchange/{ticker}.AI1"
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers={"accept": "application/json"})
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        ask = data.get("Ask")
        bid = data.get("Bid")
        return ask, bid
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch data for {ticker}. HTTP Status Code: {response.status_code}")

for category, tickers in brackets.items():
    for ticker in tickers:
        ask, bid = cx(ticker)
        if category == "Sell":
            print(f"{ticker} ({category}): {bid}")
        elif category == "Buy":
            print(f"{ticker} ({category}): {ask}")
```


[24-Nov-24 04:53 PM] antisyntax#0000
for my case, its selling AL, and buying O, FLX, H2O, and consumables


[24-Nov-24 04:53 PM] antisyntax#0000
ill refine it later, right now i just wanted something quick and dirty


[24-Nov-24 05:26 PM] jcheung#0000

`/csv/prices` gets everything you could need in one query, and can dump straight into sheets/excel


[24-Nov-24 06:08 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Sorry... Even though PRUN has it's niche in terms of a player base... htf will we use your script @antisyntax ?

This ain't hate either. Probably a good number of our #ADI programmers know C/C++/C#/Java/JS/Perl//Ruby/Python or something else, usually in some combination...

But those peeps usually are burdened with workflows and #time....... 

With a few additional guides/walk-through... how can an average PRUNner make use of those scripts (if they have the time)?


[24-Nov-24 06:11 PM] antisyntax#0000
idk i was just throwing up my rudamentory code if anyone wanted to use it... i didn't give it much thought. I am working on something much bigger which will be easier to use, just thought that code could be helpful to others

I'd stay away from FIO, if possible... It's a common point of failure. IF FIO maintainers get doxxed, or they have IRL stuff to handle for years, or et cetera... Everyone's common point of informatics basically breaks if something changes. 

Yet... everyone is using FIO dependent tools. :/

[24-Nov-24 11:47 PM] evov#0000
Version 1 of my sheets started with my cut/pasting all the CX data I was interested in, into a sheet. Took about 15mins to do that whenever I wanted to update. Then I saw a vid on how to import the prices list and I was like...... Yay!

Functionally though - everything I use I can manually change the numbers. And the most recent model I use only really uses prices data for raw materials, and to a lesser extent / consumes / repairs   (consumes/repairs when combined are stable enough I could just set benchmark prices and review them once every couple a weeks )

So yes, losing fio prices data would be a pain in the ass, but if everyone is in the same boat, I'm sure I'll manage ok.


[26-Nov-24 02:06 PM] manhim#0000
Just finished my repairs sheet.

Using FIO's /csv/sites data. There's a sheet listing which bases and which buildings I'm following, and for each of them I set a limit (day at which I need to repair) and a threshold (how many days before I should be warned).

It then outputs all of it on another sheet that shows each individual buildings where I have some conditional formatting set for visual warnings and I've setup the new Conditional notifications feature to warn me whenever a building gets to 7 days before needing to be repaired. It's the first time that I'm using this feature.

This enables me to track each buildings that needs to be repaired with it's own set of rules. I then add in my burn sheet the repair materials required so that I just need to push buttons at the right time.

I'm slowly automating myself out of a j... game üòÑ

[27-Nov-24 08:02 AM] jcheung#0000
Limiting active ships and permit count would already be a good incentive


[27-Nov-24 08:02 AM] jcheung#0000
Daily QoL stuff like queues and contracts? That's way too locked down

You want long term retention not short term profits


[27-Nov-24 08:03 AM] sidepipe#0000
Maybe, but it works because I‚Äôm afraid of letting my pro expire üòÑ


[27-Nov-24 08:03 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^^


[27-Nov-24 08:03 AM] jcheung#0000
If you let basic be reasonable you keep people arpund playing basic, and then later they go pro again


[27-Nov-24 08:03 AM] jcheung#0000
Instead of outright quitting


[27-Nov-24 08:04 AM] jcheung#0000
Like some of the QoL stuff could be pared down compared to pro, but not totally eliminated.


[27-Nov-24 08:05 AM] jcheung#0000
Your mindset roh, is why games have been getting shittier and shittier each passing year. Short term profits and fuck the long term health of the community


[27-Nov-24 08:06 AM] jcheung#0000
Though that's not limited to just games, that's just been the fastest devolving example


[27-Nov-24 08:06 AM] sidepipe#0000
Idk, I know of quite a few players on basic. I don‚Äôt agree with all the choices, but it‚Äôs not bad for getting to play the game for free


[27-Nov-24 08:06 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
In my mindset, I support indie devs, for unique games like Prun. Simulogics decided on a long-term game, and a long-term subscription model --- so be it.


[27-Nov-24 08:08 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
And yes, most players on Prun are Trials. If sashka's prun-stats site is even remotely accurate... You're basically seeing most, if not all of the paying users on UFO, and that's only amounting to ~10% of the total user base.


[27-Nov-24 08:09 AM] manhim#0000
Why, they would have no reasons to if basic would suffice.


[27-Nov-24 08:11 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
I'm kinda with you about putting expansion potential and flight limits and even sending conts behind the wall, but you're 100% right that putting basic QoL stuff behind the wall is costing them players


[27-Nov-24 08:11 AM] jcheung#0000
I'm not saying give everything. Keep HQ limit. Keep ship in transit limit. Degrade queues. But at the same time be better than what's available now.


[27-Nov-24 08:11 AM] jcheung#0000
That's what I'm fucking saying. You're missing market capture and only relying on the whales


[27-Nov-24 08:12 AM] jcheung#0000
Whales will whale either way, and individuals may have shorter sub terms but you have more of them


[27-Nov-24 08:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm not sure if this is a market capture sort of game, but I get your point üòÑ


[27-Nov-24 08:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
Wait, technically it literally is


[27-Nov-24 08:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
But you know what I mean üòÅ


[27-Nov-24 08:13 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
** Roh opens up steam ...** Market capture, yes!


[27-Nov-24 08:13 AM] jcheung#0000
I mean it in the most literal sense


[27-Nov-24 08:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
Sometimes I wonder if we‚Äôd all be better off if pro was half the price and there was no free tier other than a 1-2 month trial

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[27-Nov-24 08:14 AM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
they could get more of that market if they plopped in subscription codes as steam --> prun account linkages.


[27-Nov-24 08:14 AM] cptcoleslaw#0000
Like, I'm pretty poor... I couldn't afford pro after the hurricane hit here recently. My empire isn't even that big and everything went to shit, the extra work needed to keep it up was rough. QoL blocked by PRO keeps people from hanging out on low burn in times like holidays right now then coming back later. Instead people just quit

[27-Nov-24 08:14 AM] manhim#0000
Nah, I think that letting people put a foot in the door is too important for such a niche game


[27-Nov-24 08:14 AM] jcheung#0000
I would argue probably yes.


[27-Nov-24 08:14 AM] jcheung#0000
But 6 month free (at reduced ability) rather than 2


[27-Nov-24 08:17 AM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôd be interesting if there were stats on basic retention - how long people play on average before re-subbing or quitting

You can dismantle all your buildings, but I wish there was a one-button solution


[27-Nov-24 08:18 AM] jcheung#0000
Like this could be a pro feature


[27-Nov-24 08:19 AM] manhim#0000
But then you lose some of the materials, so you need to ship back those materials to rebuild the buildings. But I guess it kinda make sense. Basically forcing you to repair.


[27-Nov-24 08:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôd love a mothball button with a 5-10 day reactivation timer


[27-Nov-24 08:21 AM] sidepipe#0000
Long enough that you can‚Äôt abuse it when you run out of supplies temporarily


[27-Nov-24 08:21 AM] manhim#0000
Yeah, that would balance it


[27-Nov-24 08:23 AM] jcheung#0000
Or even like a 12 hr wind down and wind up


[27-Nov-24 08:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
Or no timer but it kicks your workforce back to the pool so you might have to wait on popr to refill


[27-Nov-24 08:24 AM] sidepipe#0000

[01-Dec-24 09:43 AM] sidepipe#0000

[01-Dec-24 09:43 AM] laaxus#0000
which is sound, as people usually buy hss a few unit at a time


[01-Dec-24 09:43 AM] laaxus#0000
so he could refill the order as soon as someone buy from him


[01-Dec-24 09:43 AM] sidepipe#0000
time to get in touch with RogueHX, get him to delist his order, and buy up all of those orders

Prosperous Universe is a great game, but some missing features and minor annoyances can disrupt the experience. So here be dragons.  Refined PrUn started as a fork of PMMG Extended and ended up being an almost complete rewrite of the base extension. The result is better performance and UI responsiveness, as well as new features and QoL improveme...

[07-Dec-24 08:00 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Mmm, ~3 new arrivals. since the 6th. 

Filefolders ([ CORPS COSM ] -- Cosmocene Collective --- a play on the goop that Soviet industrial production use to lubricate their gears + moving parts --- some really stanky stuff. I think they're the lead on that, and they're around HRT or so, but I don't have exact details)... 

2 newbros, looking to get into the food business and fuel production business. Those two businesses have high capital sinks in terms of shipping requirements and rather low profitability margins, as compared to higher end production, and expansion is pretty slow... Worthwhile to let in, imo.

Can always pitch new ideas, or generally provide info & mentor mentor the fledgling youth, if anyone has the time.

Uhm.......


[07-Dec-24 08:02 PM] tanda#0000
oh, I've got a base idea for them


[07-Dec-24 08:02 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
The Phobos fuel producer can do it... There's alot of "hidden" fuel producers on the starter worlds, around the CXs and whatnot. Most higher margin industries basically ate the Fuel Refining COGCs that were around, so it's basically lower margin than most things, and people just have to get triple green worlds where they can on that.


[07-Dec-24 08:03 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
If they want a grant.... They should use it for those WCB upgrades that we've got a project going in here for.


[07-Dec-24 08:20 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I'll ping the Phobos person with a question in the airlock. 

The food person can do their thing easily within Antares... although it'll be rather unorthodox per current metas, if they'd take my recommendations (subsequent in-house chatter), or something else. 

Idk the food person's long-term plan though. Pre-planning and selling a viable pitch, with metrics, is a big thing in my book. 3-4 sentence summaries don't convey those details very well.

[07-Dec-24 08:29 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
But since you have that much experience, I can confer on-par recommendations/considerations, if you want to do the fuel thing... Keep this in mind though; you can switch to a different industrial focus/mix at any time, or you can just keep doing the fuel thing. Both are valid, since Prun as a game is rather forgiving... There's no real mistakes, unless you mis-click on a market order!


[07-Dec-24 08:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
As for the topic of immediate concern... You've said you want to do the fuel business on Phobos.. Can you share a "base link" from prunplanner, or just give me your production building + habitation building numbers, from what you intend to do right now?

I can run my own numbers, and show you screenshots.


[07-Dec-24 08:36 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
I dont have th e planner but i have currently 2 HB1, oxygen extractor, 1 refinery, and 1 HB2


[07-Dec-24 08:36 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Along with a stock of consumables for pioneers and settlers


[07-Dec-24 08:38 PM] jvaler#0000
if you're not attached to the idea of fuel refining, myself and tanda were chatting earlier about how good DW production currently is. a 28 FP base on phobos makes 100k/d right now, although the only concern is shipping capacity requirements.

however, ADI currently has a ship upgrade kit program that can get your starter 500t/500m^3 ships upgraded to 3000t/1000m^3 ships which solves this issue. the kits cost 1.35mil each, however i'm offering 90 day 0% interest loans to help players who can't pay that much upfront. that comes out to just 15k/d in repayments, which is easily offset by the profits of the DW base


[07-Dec-24 08:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well I can float them on an FP base on Heph, since I have the shipping.. If they'd like basically an immediate boost to their current profitable revenues, we can arrange that...

But It'll take a newbro like 3-->6 months to a year, to figure out what they like to do... It helps in long-term retention metrics.


[07-Dec-24 08:51 PM] jvaler#0000
float them a base? what does that mean? and why FP on heph? heph has a perfectly good manufacturing CoGC

the idea is that AGP will pay for ~80% of the phobos base

[07-Dec-24 09:02 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Why is FP fabricating so space intesive?


[07-Dec-24 09:07 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Indeed, float. I won't have my prun instance up for another hour or so. 

But given the metrics in that screenshot, the newbro player in discussion, will not have the the logistical upgrades in ship parts, to deal with a max base allowance, per week, per ADI grant standards. I can deal with that shipping easily, and even give the a starting grant of H20... for like 2 weeks. Shipping will be free. 

Consider it an experiment. It'll take them a while to get used to the game. I can float them in shipping for about a month.... They can always get used to the LM market, via planetary COMGs "advertisements" to get people to ship their stuff for a slight expense.

They can always re-tool Heph to a different industry, or to focus Phobos to Fuel Refining, or something else. But these things take time, and so if you're looking to boost ANT CX supply for DW, this is a win-win-win, in the short term.

The shipping rates between Phobos and ANT CX... are really bad though... Hence why I recommend Heph, as another off-COGC planet, since I can supply it at a moments notice, within a day.


[07-Dec-24 09:14 PM] jvaler#0000
PSK kit loans are entirely separate from AGP. they can be eligible for both. shipping won't be an issue.

> Indeed, float.
float what? you didn't explain what you mean

phobos has basically identical flight times as heph. this is just wrong

[07-Dec-24 09:16 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Consider the screenshot in whole. I'm usually focusing on the top right segment, with shipping I/Os... Typical transit rates from ANT <--> Phobos are 1-2 days, each for import, or export. Typical transits between Heph and ANT CX are usually within 6 <--> 12 hours.

And I have no info on your ship design.


[07-Dec-24 09:17 PM] jvaler#0000
typical transit times between heph and ANT are 3-6hrs...


[07-Dec-24 09:18 PM] jvaler#0000
and the ship uses an FSE, it's even slower than an upgraded starter

1-2 days is nonsense


[07-Dec-24 09:23 PM] jvaler#0000
what do you mean by this? FP aren't really space intensive, they're actually one of the smaller area buildings in the game. 28 of them fitting in the 475 area of a 1 permit base is quite a bit compared to other buildings


[07-Dec-24 09:26 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yep. 

So if the focus on Phobos for @mephistopheles0242 regarding an FP base producing DW, consider my offer withdrawn and closed.

They, should now consider this offer https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1192951755462410271/1315145504929218641 as their go-to.

This has been a wonder discussion @jvaler. I thank you for it. üòÑ


[07-Dec-24 09:27 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Fyi. I know my STL / FTL routing rather well. I just offered what I knew I could deliver on. Phobos is a no go for me, regarding a targeted-expansion plan.


[07-Dec-24 09:30 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Lol i didnt wanna build on phobos either but i didnt have mats for anywhere else really that made any sense


[07-Dec-24 09:30 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
It gave me mats for phobos and then 4 other not so useful planets so i picked phobos


[07-Dec-24 09:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
@mephistopheles0242 how many days do you have in-game?


[07-Dec-24 09:30 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
A COLIQ is possible if you aren't too far in.


[07-Dec-24 09:30 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
2


[07-Dec-24 09:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
yeah it is possible... uhm... are you in UFO discord?


[07-Dec-24 09:31 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
i did one right after readin the wiki and such and it only gave me enough mats for phobos and a few other really basic planets and not enough cash to purchase the required parts to set up anywhere else


[07-Dec-24 09:31 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
i can do another tomorrow tho


[07-Dec-24 09:32 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
we all started with that....

Does anyone here have a reference for cool-down timers on the COLIQ?


[07-Dec-24 09:32 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
UFO discord? No


[07-Dec-24 09:32 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
first is free second is after 3 days


[07-Dec-24 09:32 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
so next time i can coliq is tomorrow


[07-Dec-24 09:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Well, I'd recommend some further discussion on your future plans, now, tomorrow, through Monday?

Anyone with ideas can 120% pitch in, btw.

But the overall idea is that you dismantle everything, sell it at the CX, transfer the funds via contractual bond (xxxxxx AIC, for 1 DW, and then coliq..... get those funds transfered back to you + an ADI grant, and then you can do some work_


[07-Dec-24 09:35 PM] jvaler#0000
if we're going with the DW plan a COLIQ isn't really necessary. the only other planet that would be relevant to it is norwick for it's food industries CoGC, however unlike phobos it's distance *does* invoke logistic concerns


[07-Dec-24 09:36 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Alright, im open to that for sure


[07-Dec-24 09:36 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Hell, its what i wanted to do yesterday but alas, lack of money as most problems in life tend to be


[07-Dec-24 09:36 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
On that note, what system and planet did you have in mind?


[07-Dec-24 09:37 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Oh, Norwick you mentioned


[07-Dec-24 09:37 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Let me find that


[07-Dec-24 09:38 PM] jvaler#0000
> dismantle everything, sell it at the CX, transfer the funds via contractual bond (xxxxxx AIC, for 1 DW, and then coliq..... get those funds transfered back to you
99% sure this is against the game's terms of service lol


[07-Dec-24 09:38 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
probably.


[07-Dec-24 09:39 PM] evov#0000
Definitely.


[07-Dec-24 09:40 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It is? well... we need a grind down a good plan for @mephistopheles0242 in the long term then... Each penny in the early-game, just compounds in earnings, the longer they stay in the game, making those profits.


[07-Dec-24 09:40 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Well, the first question i suppose then is what does the community/galaxy really need?


[07-Dec-24 09:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
"Everything"


[07-Dec-24 09:41 PM] tanda#0000
right now? we really need DW price stabilization

[07-Dec-24 09:42 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
All i do, is RAT/DW/OVE, with heavy, like super heavy capital sinks in shipping, with long-term agreements with affiliates.. .It's why I'm at 22 permits, rather than with everyone's like 25+, regarding our relative company ages.


[07-Dec-24 09:43 PM] evov#0000
The good news is - pretty much everything makes money. Some things just make it faster than others.

At the start, look at things that have ... 1. Quick RoI's.   2. Low logistics requirements.  3. High volume/fast sales.

[07-Dec-24 09:44 PM] jvaler#0000
hm, DW checks 2/3 of those boxes
but again, PSK can help with the logi


[07-Dec-24 09:44 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Do'ly noted


[07-Dec-24 09:44 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
PSK is WCBs?


[07-Dec-24 09:45 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Seems both DW and fuels as a whole have lowish logistics requirements


[07-Dec-24 09:45 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
So i could just add onto existing infrastructure


[07-Dec-24 09:45 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
in fact one of the systems i was looking at for HE3 and H previously were rich in water


[07-Dec-24 09:46 PM] jvaler#0000
correct


[07-Dec-24 09:46 PM] tanda#0000
Yeah, PSK is WCBs, not exactly perfect for this use case, but it's still doubling shipping throughput

[07-Dec-24 09:47 PM] tanda#0000
PSK is a internal acronym for our inhouse shipkit project


[07-Dec-24 09:47 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
just add a WCB to your current [   BLU   ]  starter ships.

[07-Dec-24 09:47 PM] tanda#0000
WCB is a material which gives your ships a 3k ton 1k m3 cargo bay after installation


[07-Dec-24 09:48 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Ah i see


[07-Dec-24 10:01 PM] tanda#0000
sorry, just realized that was the boring backend of the PSK project. Just know that it includes everything needed to do an upgrade from starter ship to the WCB with the addition of expanded fuel tanks and LHP conversion. jvaler offers in house financing for the whole amount as stated above


[07-Dec-24 10:45 PM] jvaler#0000
in house financing... sounds so professional


[07-Dec-24 10:47 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Yep


[07-Dec-24 10:47 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Also, is there a limit,soft or otherwise to the ceiling on number of buildings?


[07-Dec-24 10:47 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
or a logistics penalty for too much?


[07-Dec-24 10:48 PM] jvaler#0000
all bases are limited by area, and each building takes up an amount of area specified in it's given `BUI` command


[07-Dec-24 10:51 PM] jvaler#0000
permits are the overall limiting factor of the size of your operations, as they determine how much area you can have.
to have a base requires 1 permit, which gives you 500 maximum area in that base. although only 475 of that area is functional, as 25 of it is taken up by the core module.

you can also expand a base up to 2 times using permits, where each permit gives you an extra 250 maximum area. this is only recommended in specific circumstances as it is a less efficient permit to area ratio.


[07-Dec-24 10:52 PM] jvaler#0000
to get more permits requires upgrading your HQ, which can be seen in the `HQ` command


[07-Dec-24 10:52 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Does each base get its own set of permits, and does the HQ command increase permits on all bases or just the HQ base


[07-Dec-24 10:53 PM] jvaler#0000
your permits are a pool that are allocated to bases


[07-Dec-24 10:53 PM] jvaler#0000
so bases "consume" permits, in a way


[07-Dec-24 10:53 PM] jvaler#0000
but permits can always be refunded by removing expansions or demolishing the base entirely


[07-Dec-24 10:54 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Can multiple bases be built on a single planet?


[07-Dec-24 10:54 PM] jvaler#0000
they cannot


[07-Dec-24 10:54 PM] jvaler#0000
if you want more area on one planet you need to use expansions


[07-Dec-24 10:54 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Well, theres the soft cap then


[07-Dec-24 10:54 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
that makes sense


[07-Dec-24 10:54 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Thank you


[07-Dec-24 10:54 PM] jvaler#0000
yup


[07-Dec-24 10:55 PM] jvaler#0000
that's what gives people incentive to go out and colonize new planets


[07-Dec-24 10:55 PM] jvaler#0000
for example i have 22 permits due to being HQ level 21, and 17 of them are put into me having 17 bases

[07-Dec-24 10:56 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
If thats the case, how does the current political system work


[07-Dec-24 10:56 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
roughly


[07-Dec-24 10:56 PM] jvaler#0000
anything that could fall under a "government" umbrella is currently operated by players on a planet-by-planet basis


[07-Dec-24 10:57 PM] jvaler#0000
each planet has their own elected government that manages tax rates, population infrastructure levels, workforce programs, and upkeep


[07-Dec-24 10:57 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
Makes sense

It's best to get up to speed, not in that you'll completely understand everything in Prun... rather that you'll be able to figure out what anyone is talking about, or referring to...

[08-Dec-24 08:10 PM] finestone#0000
Imo if you get the grant you wont need to as you can just go setup a base on the preferred planet


[08-Dec-24 10:32 PM] mephistopheles0242#0000
fair


[09-Dec-24 08:57 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
You'll have to figure out something, and plop in a grant application + base plan @ #agp-operations. There's more info/tools/resources for you available @ #prun-resources. 

But me shoving 2+ years of experience/ideas from multiple people, into your head rn, isn't going to exactly help you out, as you'll have to find your own way in the game anyways. 

There's a huge learning curve in Prun, just like in Eve... But thankfully there's enough time in Prun, for you to explore the game on your own, do the maths/spreadsheets, and hammer out a long-term plan for yourself.

Hmm, Bumble-Bro is probably feeling the #heat from the market response, and they're now -1 / (3 Sig Fig) re-listing to retain as much capital gains as possible, from sales turnover.

I've seen this before, and they could potentially keep doing this, unless local production outstrips their purchase activity - turnover metrics. It's the only way to beat this sort of abuse, per maths.

ADI could always sponsor an ~~Off~~ ON-COGC, LST --> FLX base @ ~~Nike~~ whatever's around, for a really new bro or something. I don't think there's a good LST deposit on a CHM COGC around us, but it's whatever. It's a good case study! üòÑ

I suspect there's plenty of production capacity out there. FLX has just been way too cheap for way too long. It needs to be over the 260/u mark to make sense imo.

And MOR isn't just suffering because I bought out their FLX .... it's because I bought it out AND shipped it to ANT üôÇ


[17-Dec-24 02:01 PM] evov#0000
Which - was only possible because someone gave a heads up here about the flx issue.  -Just pointing out the collective benefit to having an Antare's market watch channel so people can ring the alarm bells when we're under attack.

Uhm... I think you staff are doing a good job on the server stuff. But some more neatness is kinda necessary. Multiple message postings of the same topic, over multiple channels gets nothing...

When channel threads, or just DMs do the same work.

[17-Dec-24 04:41 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I kinda like the "market watch" suggestion...

But I'm usually more favourable towards systemic and cyclic relationships, rather than "spot fixes". To cut the chatter as much as possible... 

Which industries, or end products, would you recommend Antareans to consider, for the best fluidity/interchange of CX-based commerce? So most impact, least exchange'd stuff like FLX.AI1, as the most recent example?

Everything, or anything, is not a valid suggestion, in this inquiry. üòõ


[17-Dec-24 04:56 PM] jvaler#0000
production takes quite a while to spool up. market alerts would just allow those with existing unlisted stock to take advantage of immediate shortage situations, which benefits everyone.


[17-Dec-24 05:24 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It's a fair concern... 

But then again it's an idling game.. so time flies by really fast. 

If I was an un-discerning party, with about ~30 mil+ of AIC to dump into markets, could I then keep re-buying, and re-listing the ASK-stocks, at a higher rate, at some weekly interval? ... *There's no price ceiling for most items...*

If so, at an even distribution of not only information, but also capital.. Then there's a 50/50 % chance of either my my #war-chest breaking... or say ANT's weekly export's-to-market breaking.. 

Who wins? How do we know beforehand? What's the best strategy for this sort of #siege-situation? XD


[17-Dec-24 05:37 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
^ It's just "ideas". If Evov want's to #wargame.. yeah I'm totally gonna dig this, lol. Else, idc.

We could do a more... longer form, of say a "strategy" channel...  Less short "burst" comments, and more general, more experienced, more nuanced approaches of what's possible in the next 6+ months of what's happening. 

That's it from me. 

I've seen academics re-write a given idea.. into suitable publications for different audiences.. Maybe a more structured, but "open" approach is what we've all aiming for.


[17-Dec-24 06:15 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000

Yeah, it was a good early expansion for me, but it's been there nearly a year now and is just... there. Carbon is stable (for now), and that permit could be used better elsewhere I feel. Actually leaning towards maybe winding down Thalassa too, but I spent so long trying to expand there it doesn't feel worth it


[17-Dec-24 06:18 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Yeah, just take a given statement of "yeah I'm gonna say this, and that"...

You can restructure it to suit, or seek, a given feedback.. Either 1-2 sentences... 3-5 sentences, or 1-2 paragraphs, depending on scope.. I'm not sure if this is sort of approach is warranted though.. Just a suggestion from what I've seen.


[17-Dec-24 06:19 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
Lots of mix & match.


[17-Dec-24 06:21 PM] jvaler#0000
what i've decided to do with harmonia+nascent is turn harmonia into more HER prod and then have nascent just run off single input HCP from thalassa b.

though it does look like C prod is pretty weak rn :/

The C market, overall, is generally a bad idea.. Huge shipping I/Os.. Low margins... You're better off running DW, or CL, or whatever process that gets you reasonable returns, around ~70k daily profits, at reasonable commodity --> liquidity means... Everything else is just a ponzi scheme, imo.

You know, I heard if you buy up the market to where it's about 900-1k each...


[17-Dec-24 06:31 PM] tanda#0000
lol! you get people to up production? That's why we're here


[17-Dec-24 06:31 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I tried it.... Took me like 10 minutes just to buffer in some basic  #base figures...

yeah just gotta let the market run it's course

[17-Dec-24 06:33 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
It was always like that for me.. So much lag.. It's why I stick to (local) Prunner pics... I can fab up a base design in 30 seconds in Prunner... 10 minutes in Prunplanner...


[17-Dec-24 06:33 PM] moke.#0000
But that takes time, and people get impatient on buy orders


[17-Dec-24 06:34 PM] jvaler#0000
could it be an internet issue? most other people don't have 10min load times


[17-Dec-24 06:34 PM] tanda#0000
If one could convince allocater to pull those asks, buying out the market would be super cheap. There's very little between 800-710 except his asks


[17-Dec-24 06:34 PM] scintillating_iridescence#0000
I have gigabit internet, and I keep my computer loads down when I try out new things.

idk, once I'm on the sheet, it's around 1 minute and that's probably because I'm slow

Many people have antares bases. 1 base in antares is no big deal üôÇ
Even I had 1 base here for a long time (its quite central to my operation though, has 3 permitd and requires 3 support bases üòÖ)

[02-Jan-25 07:25 AM] o.pie#0000
Does this look like a good idea?


[02-Jan-25 07:26 AM] o.pie#0000
It is 500 area but that can be doubled in time.


[02-Jan-25 07:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I do not recommend multi permit


[02-Jan-25 07:27 AM] laaxus#0000
also, I would avoid WPL


[02-Jan-25 07:27 AM] laaxus#0000
I would either make it 20 bmp or 10 BMP 10 PPF


[02-Jan-25 07:28 AM] o.pie#0000
I could just do 20 bmp


[02-Jan-25 07:28 AM] tanda#0000
I'm definitely on the fence for WPL as well, I don't think I would do 5 for sure


[02-Jan-25 07:28 AM] o.pie#0000
what would i make with a ppf that i could reliably sell


[02-Jan-25 07:29 AM] tanda#0000
I was actually literally looking at dropping 2 WPL for NL only on Heph myself, but that's just for self consumption


[02-Jan-25 07:29 AM] laaxus#0000
Fire (I think ?)  regularly buy a ton of PSM, but just never put any bid


[02-Jan-25 07:30 AM] o.pie#0000
alright


[02-Jan-25 07:30 AM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend going BMP tho


[02-Jan-25 07:31 AM] laaxus#0000
because, even if bmp sometimes don't have ton of profit, you'll always be able to sell your production


[02-Jan-25 07:31 AM] laaxus#0000
which is not the case with PPF


[02-Jan-25 07:31 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm currently trying to create stock on the market so that people rely on it more


[02-Jan-25 07:31 AM] o.pie#0000
I will do that.


[02-Jan-25 07:31 AM] o.pie#0000
Which brings me to my next question: would anyone care to invest in this venture?


[02-Jan-25 07:31 AM] o.pie#0000
If not I can wait two weeks for the DW to sell


[02-Jan-25 07:32 AM] laaxus#0000
If you want to speed up your gameplay, you can take a loan


[02-Jan-25 07:32 AM] laaxus#0000

Thank you.  I will contact one of them.


[02-Jan-25 07:53 AM] o.pie#0000
By the way, how expensive is a non-ftl ship.   I may need to build one in the near future to haul all of this H2O to and from the CX.


[02-Jan-25 07:54 AM] laaxus#0000
you should not build a new ship


[02-Jan-25 07:55 AM] laaxus#0000
you should upgrade your starting ones


[02-Jan-25 07:55 AM] o.pie#0000
oh


[02-Jan-25 07:55 AM] o.pie#0000
we can do that now


[02-Jan-25 07:56 AM] laaxus#0000
using either schaitr deal on the UFO, or using the ADI ship kit, see #psk-information


[02-Jan-25 07:59 AM] jcheung#0000
h2o benefits from a LCB


[02-Jan-25 07:59 AM] jcheung#0000
so if that's a very major bottleneck, then you should consider building new, but otherwise a WCB upgrade will get you double the water hauled


[02-Jan-25 08:00 AM] jcheung#0000
and then up to 6x for stuff like rocks and metals-i don't know what your primary movement is


[02-Jan-25 08:00 AM] o.pie#0000
i'm going to be hauling H2O to my DW base on phobos and C to my BMP base on Hephaestus


[02-Jan-25 08:01 AM] jcheung#0000
C benefits from WCB


[02-Jan-25 08:01 AM] jcheung#0000
a lot


[02-Jan-25 08:01 AM] jcheung#0000
222 > 1000


[02-Jan-25 08:01 AM] jcheung#0000
per trip


[02-Jan-25 08:10 AM] o.pie#0000
ok


[02-Jan-25 08:12 AM] o.pie#0000
And last question of the day:  https://prunplanner.org/shared/0b59e8b5-b02b-4107-bbef-9d02d91a2156 does this plan look sound.  I want to make basic prefabs on Nike.  Is it right to use a PP2 to make BSE and BBH? FE seems to be in short supply on the CX compared to AL.

Why do you want to make bfabs ?


[02-Jan-25 08:13 AM] o.pie#0000
i remember needing  a lot of them to upgrade my permit level and just to build stuff in general


[02-Jan-25 08:13 AM] o.pie#0000
or should I just buy them?


[02-Jan-25 08:13 AM] laaxus#0000
you're not accounting for opportunity cost


[02-Jan-25 08:14 AM] o.pie#0000
oh... i should just spam more DW bases then?


[02-Jan-25 08:14 AM] laaxus#0000
it's better to earn 15k and buy bfabs for 10k than building bfabs for 8k


[02-Jan-25 08:15 AM] laaxus#0000
in an optic of growing your wealth as fast as possible, you should always maximise return on investment


[02-Jan-25 08:15 AM] laaxus#0000
investment should account for the permit as well as the shipping


[02-Jan-25 08:15 AM] laaxus#0000
and the potential risk, but it's harder to quantify


[02-Jan-25 08:17 AM] laaxus#0000
as for DW


[02-Jan-25 08:17 AM] laaxus#0000
you could make another DW base on norwick


[02-Jan-25 08:17 AM] laaxus#0000
but I would not recommend making many more


[02-Jan-25 08:17 AM] laaxus#0000
start diversifying your production


[02-Jan-25 08:18 AM] laaxus#0000
here's a few potential base you can look into

I can't tell you which one is best, as it depends on your values


[02-Jan-25 08:18 AM] laaxus#0000

[02-Jan-25 08:19 AM] laaxus#0000

it's up to you


[02-Jan-25 08:26 AM] jcheung#0000
generally speaking, BDE is the only bfab worth making in pp1


[02-Jan-25 08:28 AM] jcheung#0000
not because of 'short supply', but more because FE is a PITA to haul


[02-Jan-25 08:29 AM] jcheung#0000
honestly it's not a bad plan


[02-Jan-25 08:29 AM] o.pie#0000
so people just buy BSE from the market maker or what


[02-Jan-25 08:30 AM] jcheung#0000
a fair amount of bfabs, yeah


[02-Jan-25 08:30 AM] o.pie#0000
well that's lame


[02-Jan-25 08:30 AM] o.pie#0000

[02-Jan-25 08:31 AM] jcheung#0000
but your plan really isn't that bad


[02-Jan-25 08:31 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah bfabs, I only buy from the market, which is mostly market makers


[02-Jan-25 08:33 AM] jcheung#0000
it's probably a little heavy on shipping for your third base with only starters, but probably very doable


[02-Jan-25 08:35 AM] jcheung#0000
i'm guessing you went heavier on BSE because it's less AL consumption?


[02-Jan-25 08:35 AM] o.pie#0000
well just because i figured that was about the ratio i'd need them in for building stuff


[02-Jan-25 08:36 AM] jcheung#0000
guess that depends on what you're building


[02-Jan-25 09:06 AM] jvaler#0000

15x PP2s, cycling between 1x of BSE, BTA, BBH, and BDE.

Bring AL from Deimos base.
Buy LST from Nike LM
Buy PG and GL from ANT

a good BBH base should churn out about 675 BBH / week I think ?

...sorry, I haven't looked at your plan - just from my own experiences


[07-Jan-25 11:02 AM] antisyntax#0000
sounds about right. w/ 5x experts, its showing 96.3 BBH/day


[07-Jan-25 11:03 AM] .urpalhal#0000
The plan is pretty standard as PP2 bases go


[07-Jan-25 11:03 AM] igfloz#0000

Heh, yup it's identical to mine


[07-Jan-25 11:05 AM] antisyntax#0000
hm... so do i solely produce BBH or produce BSEs too. i make more money just doing BBH, but like, it requires a decent chunk of AL shipping, and if BBH alue plummets then im screwed


[07-Jan-25 11:05 AM] igfloz#0000
just be aware, LST is a space hog !

1:2 instead of 2:1


[07-Jan-25 11:06 AM] igfloz#0000
I should correct - it's 2.73t/u more of a weight hog, not space

STOs are equal 5k/5k right?


[07-Jan-25 11:06 AM] igfloz#0000

as a group we combine efforts to produce BBH / BSE - and we get paid in BBH / BSE. It's more of an effort to keep market even I guess

generally WCB upgrade should be done when your shipping starts to get saturated

HYP?

Ah, I meant HYR  - > Hyper-Power Reactor


[11-Jan-25 04:49 PM] akyantor#0000
It turns out the damage you take is proportional to how high the percentage power you run your engine, so using the highest powered one but at lower settings causes less damage, than running a lower power reactor at a higher setting.


[11-Jan-25 04:49 PM] akyantor#0000
Combined with the shields+AHP+drones, you get very low damage on each trip, much longer between repiars etc.

This is the config I've used on the last ship I built (recently upgraded on of my older LCB ships to the same spec)

Would someone mind providing feedback on this Nike base? The chemical plant is not optimal, it's there specifically to provide flux for my metallurgy operation on Deimos, which in turn provides most of the aluminum this base needs. 

I found a few configurations of this base that produced slightly more profit when I didn't provide luxes to my settlers, but I couldn't find one that didn't require importing limestone. In this configuration I have to buy 5 AL and 7 FLX per day to make up for the demand that isn't met by production. I'm playing around with some base designs that require 2 permits to see if I can make the numbers work, but haven't figured it out yet.

You also will always provide luxury‚Äôs even if on paper it doesn‚Äôt look ‚Äúworth‚Äù it, prices are probably just slightly out of whack


[11-Jan-25 08:48 PM] evany.#0000
I can‚Äôt seem to load your link as I‚Äôm on mobile and it refuses to load for some fucked reason


[11-Jan-25 08:49 PM] evany.#0000
Since your new I will also caution heavily against running two permits on one of your first ten planets, if your established and you feel it still makes sense then change it then


[11-Jan-25 08:50 PM] evany.#0000
If your running deimos then I would encourage you to just smelt al/fe purchase everything else, including flx elsewhere


[11-Jan-25 08:50 PM] wikifeia#0000
The way I see it, simplifying my supply chain while I'm still new to this game will save me more money than going all in on profits. The difference between adding one more PP2 in place of the CHP is like 1.5k in daily profit.


[11-Jan-25 08:51 PM] evany.#0000
If you want to attach a screenshot of the prunplanner go for it, but consider your experts too, if you mix things like chp while trying to do flux you are leaving an additional 30% on the table


[11-Jan-25 08:51 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I can help you out with some FLX for the mean time


[11-Jan-25 08:51 PM] evany.#0000
^ take him up on that he will give you a good price


[11-Jan-25 08:53 PM] evany.#0000
Consider for a moment that the flx your burning still has value and that‚Äôs money and area your wasting regardless of what prunplanner says. E.g a base dedicated importing whatever makes flx at 30$/unit and printing flx that he sells you for 100/unit, but your far less efficient at it, no cogc, no experts so -25% and -30% so that same flx will cost you 155/unit (napkin math)


[11-Jan-25 08:55 PM] evany.#0000
And it might feel like your simplifying things, but your kind of not.

E.g I still have my starter extractors on deimos, because I‚Äôm trash but it‚Äôs still producing insufficient amounts of alo, so have I really simplified importing of alo? Not really.


[11-Jan-25 08:56 PM] wikifeia#0000
i guess I need to think about it


[11-Jan-25 08:57 PM] tanda#0000
In the near term I actually agree with the EXT, but not the CHP>FLX


[11-Jan-25 08:57 PM] tanda#0000
LST is at 240 on the CX at the moment, so having some production of it yourself until things clear up a bit is not a bad idea


[11-Jan-25 09:02 PM] wikifeia#0000
So I guess the majority of people source aluminum from nascent and then process it on deimos?


[11-Jan-25 09:03 PM] evany.#0000
correct, my nascent guy has volume if you want to get in on it


[11-Jan-25 09:04 PM] wikifeia#0000

[11-Jan-25 09:10 PM] wikifeia#0000
ü§£ it's a little depressing having put so much thought into balancing resource needs vs production, only to see that a single nascent base with 14 EXT perfectly supplies two deimos bases with 20 SME

[20-Jan-25 04:23 PM] wikifeia#0000
how do you establish a second base on a planet you've already settled? All I'm seeing is the "view base" button.


[20-Jan-25 04:25 PM] igfloz#0000
1 planet, 1 base - you can expand the base, but it is not really a good use of money


[20-Jan-25 04:26 PM] igfloz#0000
you start with 500 base area, you can expand twice, for only 250 each time (max 1000 area)


[20-Jan-25 04:26 PM] igfloz#0000
not a good use of base expansion, when you could go to a different planet for another 500 area


[20-Jan-25 04:27 PM] wikifeia#0000
Oh fr? Fair enough I guess, a nascent resource extraction base produces enough alo for two metallurgy bases, so I was hoping to have two bases on deimos


[20-Jan-25 04:28 PM] wikifeia#0000
I guess I'll need a second metallurgy base on vulcan


[20-Jan-25 04:29 PM] igfloz#0000
I also have ALO EXT on Nascent, and I feed 2 customers regularly. any leftover spoils I can also smelt periodically


[20-Jan-25 04:29 PM] wikifeia#0000
I figure highest profit possible is feeding yourself, no? any reason you don't do it?


[20-Jan-25 04:30 PM] igfloz#0000
vertical integration "can" provide profit. But I'm not sure it is the best way. There are better people here that can explain


[20-Jan-25 04:31 PM] wikifeia#0000
fair enough


[20-Jan-25 04:39 PM] igfloz#0000
not sure if this is a good explanation, but here goes

Starting out - Make item 1 (1 ingredient, ALO for example) ---> sell item 1
When you have  some capital - Make item 2 (might have 2, or 3 ingredients) ---> sell item 2

The things that might affect item 2 will be the additional ingredients that you don't make, additional burn items, the market might change , or even disappear. -  If you end up creating full vertical integration for item 2, it may cost you more to make than you can sell for.


[20-Jan-25 04:40 PM] igfloz#0000
item 1  --> item 2 --> sell, is not always the "best" profit


[20-Jan-25 04:47 PM] wikifeia#0000
i figure minimizing market exposure is the best strategy in the longrun though no?


[20-Jan-25 04:48 PM] wikifeia#0000
I'm sure it varies when it comes to expensive/specialized goods, but you can always pivot if needed when doing basic resource extraction/manufacturing


[20-Jan-25 04:49 PM] igfloz#0000
it's possible, but sometimes, can also be expensive ( relatively ) to pivot


[20-Jan-25 04:50 PM] igfloz#0000
I'm not knocking anything you might be thinking of. Just trying to maybe provide some insight


[20-Jan-25 04:52 PM] random_di5cord_user#0000
it is not super surprising that stability and control (e.g. of market exposure, shipping delays, etc) are likely a tradeoff with maximizing profits.


[20-Jan-25 05:47 PM] jvaler#0000
feeding yourself doesn't affect your profits, because the value of the items you consume is the same regardless of if it's bought or produced yourself


[20-Jan-25 05:49 PM] jvaler#0000
well, it can provide price stability, but that can go either way. sometimes the input is expensive, so producing it yourself is just profitable. and then sometimes the input is cheap, so producing it yourself is just unprofitable


[20-Jan-25 05:51 PM] jvaler#0000
basically you need to think of each base's production as independently producing profit from your other bases. 

the exception to this is when the intermediate item's market has no supply and you're forced to produce it yourself, then you need to average the profits of your end product with the base that makes the intermediate


[20-Jan-25 06:12 PM] jcheung#0000
Some chains get annoyingly complex, and when you get over 20 permits it starts getting expensive


[20-Jan-25 06:12 PM] jcheung#0000
So it's unrealistic to VI all the way for more complex items


[20-Jan-25 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
Also some of the lower level things, like RATs for example, require multiple bases producing agri for best effect


[20-Jan-25 06:13 PM] jcheung#0000
And it's unrealistic to produce all of it yourself


[21-Jan-25 09:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
In about 3 days or less my base is gonna look like this on a 30h+ round trip while I still have default ships, how do I upgrade my ship, and how much does it cost?

[21-Jan-25 10:04 AM] pagy1234#0000
I just found the ship kit channel, but only a 3000t/1000m ship is offered? according to the table above I would much prefer a 2000t/2000m ship if thats possible üòÅ


[21-Jan-25 10:05 AM] pagy1234#0000
If its not possible then it should be fine I think, its still a pretty solid improvement


[21-Jan-25 10:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
theres an alternate that involves no ship upgrade, I can change to the alternate DW recipie; if I invest a little more into FP's and get from 15 to 21, I can make the same revenue but with 15k less expense and a 1.64d import frequency, Which is manageable with just 1 ship going constantly. will this be better in the long term or not at all?


[21-Jan-25 10:35 AM] flor2081#0000
upgrading a starter ship is a lot cheaper to WCB (3kt/1km¬≥) as you dont need to change as many parts


[21-Jan-25 10:35 AM] flor2081#0000
ah nvm didnt read the kit channel


[21-Jan-25 10:41 AM] flor2081#0000
the PG DW recipe is better yes


[21-Jan-25 10:41 AM] flor2081#0000
unless you're seriously trying to pump out as much DW as possible but thats a bad idea if you cant ship it


[21-Jan-25 10:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
alr, might be the goal then


[21-Jan-25 10:42 AM] laaxus#0000
not that much better iirc ?


[21-Jan-25 10:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
about 25% more profit if revenue is equal


[21-Jan-25 10:42 AM] flor2081#0000
well the difference is like a full ship so yeah :p


[21-Jan-25 10:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
79k daily profit Vs. 63k when both revenues are about 150k

You can always just tear it down again, FPs are cheap

You're nit wrong


[21-Jan-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000

[21-Jan-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000
Or fim


[21-Jan-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000

[21-Jan-25 11:08 AM] laaxus#0000
FP are very profitable


[21-Jan-25 11:08 AM] jcheung#0000
I do a little mea already


[21-Jan-25 11:09 AM] jcheung#0000
I probably need to do more fim to feed my mea


[21-Jan-25 11:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
alot of the things it makes will always be in high demand


[21-Jan-25 11:09 AM] jcheung#0000
*stares at market*


[21-Jan-25 11:09 AM] laaxus#0000
(I can sell a bit of her if you need it)


[21-Jan-25 11:11 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, if you're looking for an expansion path


[21-Jan-25 11:11 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd heavily recommend to make an  HER base on Harmonia


[21-Jan-25 11:12 AM] laaxus#0000
(and then refine it to fim)


[21-Jan-25 11:12 AM] laaxus#0000
@pagy1234


[21-Jan-25 11:12 AM] laaxus#0000
it would divide your shipping needs by 2


[21-Jan-25 11:13 AM] pagy1234#0000
will look into it


[21-Jan-25 11:13 AM] laaxus#0000
furthermore, a FRM base is the cheapest base one can make


[21-Jan-25 11:13 AM] laaxus#0000
and with a high roi

[21-Jan-25 11:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
i see


[21-Jan-25 11:14 AM] laaxus#0000
I arguably have a roi of like 5-7


[21-Jan-25 11:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
howcome?


[21-Jan-25 11:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
it says 11 right there lol


[21-Jan-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000
because I put prunplanner cx settings to buy at ask, and sell at bid


[21-Jan-25 11:15 AM] laaxus#0000
(which you should do)


[21-Jan-25 11:16 AM] laaxus#0000
however, it does not apply when you consume your production


[21-Jan-25 11:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
ah i see


[21-Jan-25 11:16 AM] laaxus#0000
The current bid price is like 2600


[21-Jan-25 11:17 AM] laaxus#0000
but imo, the market price is in the range [3000, 3500]


[21-Jan-25 11:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
so on that base you have HER production and then direct production of FIM?


[21-Jan-25 11:17 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah


[21-Jan-25 11:17 AM] laaxus#0000
all my her production goes directly to norwick


[21-Jan-25 11:18 AM] laaxus#0000
and it fills around half my HER needs


[21-Jan-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh you have FIM production on NOR?


[21-Jan-25 11:18 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah


[21-Jan-25 11:18 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah cuz the bonussss


[21-Jan-25 11:18 AM] laaxus#0000
I am a full time fim producer on norwick


[21-Jan-25 11:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
Il see if i can do something about making HER then adjusting my production of FIM on Norwick to how much HER i have


[21-Jan-25 11:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
As a DDT producer, I think the world needs more HER üòÑ


[21-Jan-25 11:20 AM] laaxus#0000
it would reduce your shipping issue


[21-Jan-25 11:20 AM] laaxus#0000
by around half


[21-Jan-25 11:20 AM] laaxus#0000
lol


[21-Jan-25 11:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
il do some experimenting on prunplanner tmr


[21-Jan-25 11:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
Il see how much I can produce for a reasonable base price


[21-Jan-25 11:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
for now I deal with DW until i have a solution :D


[21-Jan-25 11:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
goodnight


[21-Jan-25 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
gn


[21-Jan-25 06:01 PM] pagy1234#0000
so, on the same max area layout for DW, the normal recipe makes me around 295k a day, with 148k profit, the alternate recipe only makes me 209k a day, but has 120k profit. upgrading 1 ship to WCB will allow me to go with normal recipe and make that extra 28k a month, but will. cost me 28k a day for 48 days


[21-Jan-25 06:04 PM] pagy1234#0000
a WCB will also allow me to set up another base easily though, frees up one ship completely that I can use elsewhere


[21-Jan-25 06:05 PM] pagy1234#0000
math checks out after 48 days if I dont expand, or less if I do expand somewhere else.


[21-Jan-25 06:10 PM] pagy1234#0000
48 days is alot tho


[21-Jan-25 06:10 PM] pagy1234#0000
il make myself some targets to hit before I upgrade I think


[21-Jan-25 06:10 PM] tanda#0000
48 days before it turns a profit? It pays for itself until the loan is paid off


[21-Jan-25 06:11 PM] pagy1234#0000
yeah until profit


[21-Jan-25 06:11 PM] tanda#0000
so it's net neutral. I would push for that upgrade ASAP, since it also frees up the other ship


[21-Jan-25 06:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
alr yeah, il save up some cash to get at least 500k down payment


[21-Jan-25 06:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
i just hate debt


[21-Jan-25 06:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
have about 570k rn so il get that up to 750k


[21-Jan-25 06:12 PM] pagy1234#0000
thats my goal, cya in 2 days

[23-Jan-25 03:10 PM] laaxus#0000
- pp4
- another ppf astreus
- another farm on D√©m√©ter
- another fp near demeter


[23-Jan-25 03:41 PM] tanda#0000
Hermes for the last one


[23-Jan-25 08:27 PM] jvaler#0000
only do hermes if you really need another FP planet


[23-Jan-25 08:27 PM] jvaler#0000
i'd take SE-110a over hermes if i had to. the flight time down here is kinda annoying


[23-Jan-25 08:28 PM] jvaler#0000
and for some reason the demeter <-> hermes trip takes almost as long as the ANT <-> hermes trip, it makes no sense


[23-Jan-25 08:57 PM] laaxus#0000
What's the issue with herm√®s ?


[23-Jan-25 08:58 PM] tanda#0000
well, specifically FP near demeter you only got the one option


[23-Jan-25 08:59 PM] laaxus#0000
Well, I'm not specifically attached to hermes


[23-Jan-25 09:00 PM] laaxus#0000
But what's wrong with it ?


[23-Jan-25 09:13 PM] tanda#0000
It's very far out


[23-Jan-25 09:14 PM] tanda#0000
Long flight times. If you can make do with a HYF base, Thalassa a is very wel positioned


[23-Jan-25 09:15 PM] jvaler#0000
>the flight time down here is kinda annoying


[23-Jan-25 09:15 PM] jvaler#0000
with a FSE QCR it's between 1d 4h to 1d 12hr ant <-> hermes


[23-Jan-25 09:16 PM] jvaler#0000
the idea was to be able to fly by demeter to pick up agri, but the flight time between the two is shockingly long (~1d) and i don't know why...

[27-Jan-25 07:03 PM] wikifeia#0000
Hoping that allocating one ship for transfers between nascent and deimos and the other for transfers between deimos and ai1 will be enough


[27-Jan-25 07:07 PM] jcheung#0000
you don't want VCB for ALO


[27-Jan-25 07:07 PM] jcheung#0000
you want LCB

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[27-Jan-25 07:07 PM] jcheung#0000
also you should consider just buying a new ship for the LCB


[27-Jan-25 07:49 PM] jvaler#0000
ALO is still decently efficient in a WCB, i think a PSK upgrade would still be better for the price


[27-Jan-25 07:50 PM] manhim#0000
I use a WCB to feed ALO to my 2 AL bases and it works fine


[27-Jan-25 08:01 PM] jcheung#0000
wcb is arguably many times better than VCB for ALO üòÑ

[28-Jan-25 10:16 AM] jcheung#0000
(3m being a rough estimate)


[28-Jan-25 10:16 AM] jcheung#0000
for 3m you can upgrade both your starters to WCBs


[28-Jan-25 10:17 AM] jcheung#0000

Hey All,

To keep this short, as I'm sure you've all read in snippets here and there, I got a lot of things happening that I'm moving towards IRL which is going to more and more dominate my time. Having daily commitments to things such as PrUn just isnt practical or smart. It doesnt hurt that in my mind, I won this game awhile ago. Between building the most complicated items the game offers (ships) and consistently and effectively running the largest planet governing "empire" in the game, I've done all the things that really held interest to me. These days, it just feels like stagnation. And if there is one constant through life, it is change. Change is either forward or backward, up or down, there is no such thing as standing still. The moment you realize things feel still, that is when you know you are falling. And I'm an up and forward type fella, so this is it for me in PrUn. I'm wrapping it up in a bow and callin it a day. Just over 1k days to be precise.

FAQ:
-I‚Äôm going to be winding down operations over the next month.
-No. You can not haz my stuff.
-I'll be finishing my existing ship orders as best I can, as well as not accepting new orders.
-I'll be withdrawing my name from all future gov races. Lots of planets up for grabs. Go nuts.
-I've just refilled every planet I manage. I might stick around and do it again in a month for the giggles.
-All bases will be deconstructed and items horded at the CX... probably.
-I'll list certain items, like governing goods, on the market in whatever stocks I have.
-Any and all debts to me are forgiven.
-Any leftover money in a couple months, I'll donate to new player grant or something
-I have no plans to leave the discord, so feel free to ask advice or shoot the shit. 

All the best,
Me

I‚Äôd appreciate it, thanks.


[28-Jan-25 10:48 AM] riseoffilth#0000
But it definitely required effort and a good cadre of folks who worked with me


[28-Jan-25 10:48 AM] riseoffilth#0000
It would have been impossible to make ships at the scale I did without them


[28-Jan-25 10:57 AM] realharvey#0000
The electronic chains for bridges and the crew quarter stuff is what always puts me off big time


[28-Jan-25 10:58 AM] riseoffilth#0000
It‚Äôs just a lot of bases


[28-Jan-25 10:58 AM] riseoffilth#0000

Doesn‚Äôt have to be all one person like I did


[28-Jan-25 10:59 AM] riseoffilth#0000
But at the end, I had like 6 electronics bases


[28-Jan-25 11:02 AM] realharvey#0000
configuring those for the right ratios is what killed me very time


[28-Jan-25 11:02 AM] jcheung#0000
i wish i had enough money to buy up your surplus ship parts after your current orders were done


[28-Jan-25 11:02 AM] riseoffilth#0000
I just produce IDC/EDC with my extra capacity


[28-Jan-25 11:02 AM] riseoffilth#0000
It‚Äôs all going to CX

Sad to see you go, Rise! It'll be interesting to see how the markets react. I guess I'm going to have to up my GOV game


[28-Jan-25 10:50 PM] jcheung#0000
well, for one i would expect ships to be a little more scarce or expensive in a year unless some new players enter the market


[29-Jan-25 01:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I guess most of them will be independent and start feeding the market


[29-Jan-25 01:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
If they can affort the shipping that is


[29-Jan-25 05:53 AM] tanda#0000
then some raw goods are about to be very cheap


[29-Jan-25 06:16 AM] jvaler#0000
anybody want 200 BER/d? =P


[29-Jan-25 06:16 AM] jvaler#0000
tbh i'll probably just shove it all on the CX


[29-Jan-25 06:16 AM] jvaler#0000
same goes for CLI & AL


[29-Jan-25 06:18 AM] jvaler#0000
and i get to shut down vulcan BGO/BRO early yay


[29-Jan-25 07:57 AM] jcheung#0000
F1NM was the last person from ADI to buy BER from me, idk if they still need


[29-Jan-25 07:57 AM] jcheung#0000
AL... is the AL at vulcan?


[29-Jan-25 07:58 AM] realharvey#0000
do you produce BER?


[29-Jan-25 08:00 AM] jcheung#0000

@jvaler i'll take BER üòÑ


[29-Jan-25 08:14 AM] jvaler#0000
it was 200 AIC/u with rise, sound good?


[29-Jan-25 08:14 AM] jcheung#0000
are you winding the base down?


[29-Jan-25 08:15 AM] jvaler#0000
nope


[29-Jan-25 08:15 AM] jvaler#0000
well, not yet anyways


[29-Jan-25 08:15 AM] jvaler#0000
it's pretty low maintenance since i just hand off all the export logi to ANT LM(darkfuel)


[29-Jan-25 08:15 AM] jcheung#0000
i'll do 300/u


[29-Jan-25 08:16 AM] jcheung#0000
i don't consume that much BER though, maybe i make more AMLs üòÑ

[29-Jan-25 08:20 AM] realharvey#0000
considering 978 AIC could be made its a in between offer


[29-Jan-25 08:20 AM] jcheung#0000
i mean


[29-Jan-25 08:20 AM] realharvey#0000
and its for the first buffer


[29-Jan-25 08:20 AM] jvaler#0000
that assumes anyone is crazy enough to buy at 900


[29-Jan-25 08:21 AM] realharvey#0000
maybe on a regular base I'd go down to 400


[29-Jan-25 08:21 AM] jcheung#0000
i wouldn't be surprised if some came down from north antares at 900/u

anyhow this is me with BER for a while


[29-Jan-25 10:47 PM] evov#0000
400 is about the breakpoint for me. Below 400 and I'll buy it. Over 400 and I'll look at putting down a base for 3-6months to build up a stockpile of it myself.


[30-Jan-25 10:58 PM] .urpalhal#0000
appearently I've got 56 days worth of BER to go through at my current usage rate


[31-Jan-25 01:38 AM] .urpalhal#0000
@muralanteater what do you want to do with your farms on harmonia?


[31-Jan-25 01:50 AM] muralanteater#0000
I'm kinda unsure where to go from here. I kinda wanna build "tall" if that makes sense. Fewer bases but more robust development. I've got 500k ready to invest, HER farming has been good so far. But I'm not sure how reliably I can source DDT given the lack of supply atm. Its late for me, might not reply till tommorow. Thanks for your input.


[31-Jan-25 02:27 AM] laaxus#0000

Look how much you have at ANT, lol


[03-Feb-25 01:15 PM] igfloz#0000
exactly !!! PSK has a lot to answer for ( I sent you a cont @tanda )


[03-Feb-25 01:56 PM] jcheung#0000
hey @tanda is your food project going to be overproducing water?


[03-Feb-25 06:47 PM] tanda#0000
Yes, initially


[04-Feb-25 01:07 AM] magican1980#0000
I use my produced Water for myself for 2x Carbon and 2x Rations with HYF and there is a watersink


[05-Feb-25 02:35 AM] laaxus#0000
@tanda how often do you repair a PP3 base ?


[05-Feb-25 03:12 AM] realharvey#0000
Prunplanner recommends 90 days

[05-Feb-25 03:13 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah but I'm not sure about that math


[05-Feb-25 03:14 AM] laaxus#0000
Imo, it should be the minimum of cost per day, including loss of production


[05-Feb-25 03:14 AM] laaxus#0000
not just "the day before the biggest jump"


[05-Feb-25 03:20 AM] evov#0000
Yea, not sure what's included in the calcs. Doesn't look like productivity drop's are included in those calcs though.


[05-Feb-25 03:22 AM] jvaler#0000
moonsugartravels' repair calculator is more accurate


[05-Feb-25 03:31 AM] realharvey#0000
is this the one we got in #prun-resources ?


[05-Feb-25 03:31 AM] jvaler#0000
yup


[05-Feb-25 03:31 AM] jvaler#0000
first link in the spreadsheet section


[05-Feb-25 05:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
Just throwing out an idea, wouldnt it be insanely lucrative for me to lease permits?


[05-Feb-25 05:04 AM] pagy1234#0000
Saw someone post that they lease permits in UFO, and thought that since my HQ upgrades are cheap as hell for me rn, it could be good to upgrade to like level 8 or something and lease 5 permits temporarily


[05-Feb-25 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
Some like that


[05-Feb-25 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
some doesn't


[05-Feb-25 05:15 AM] jvaler#0000
permit leasing usually requires you to handle sending all the contracts, so if you don't renew your PRO it's not viable


[05-Feb-25 05:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
I mean, I give out the permits to other people?


[05-Feb-25 05:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
The example I am looking at on UFO says that the person who wants the permit has to deal with shipping and conts


[05-Feb-25 05:30 AM] laaxus#0000
permit leasing doesn't mean you're giving out the permit


[05-Feb-25 05:31 AM] laaxus#0000
it means you're managing a base for someone else


[05-Feb-25 05:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yes I know, but Im basing this idea off and example that doesnt need all that


[05-Feb-25 05:32 AM] pagy1234#0000
Lemme just link it here

[05-Feb-25 05:34 AM] laaxus#0000
you still need pro or basic to be able to accept conts

^


[05-Feb-25 05:35 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah it's financially interesting
I took one at the start
However, liike loans, it quickly took the fun out of the game


[05-Feb-25 05:35 AM] laaxus#0000
so, you do you


[05-Feb-25 05:35 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ok ok


[05-Feb-25 05:35 AM] laaxus#0000
not all lease are equivalent tho


[05-Feb-25 05:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
Howcome?


[05-Feb-25 05:36 AM] laaxus#0000
rise gave me a 40k/d for a lease


[05-Feb-25 05:36 AM] laaxus#0000
other deal I saw was like 20k


[05-Feb-25 05:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
What drives the price difference?


[05-Feb-25 05:37 AM] laaxus#0000
whatever the seller decide


[05-Feb-25 05:37 AM] laaxus#0000
the market is very illiquid


[05-Feb-25 05:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh lol,


[05-Feb-25 05:37 AM] laaxus#0000
some find 20k ok, I find it very bad


[05-Feb-25 05:38 AM] pagy1234#0000
Depending on the players HQ level, leasing for 20k a day could be amazing instead of blasting 10 mil on the next hq level


[05-Feb-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
the main pro of a leased base is certain income to edge uncertainty


[05-Feb-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
however now I have an IDC base that do that but 10 times better


[05-Feb-25 05:38 AM] laaxus#0000
so leased base quickly became useless


[05-Feb-25 05:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
Il do some surveying first then


[05-Feb-25 05:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ask around if ppl are interested or smt


[05-Feb-25 05:39 AM] laaxus#0000
remember that leased base are zero risk income


[05-Feb-25 05:39 AM] laaxus#0000
and therefore, income is adjusted


[05-Feb-25 05:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah


[05-Feb-25 05:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
For me 20k a day is amazing though


[05-Feb-25 05:39 AM] pagy1234#0000
Even if its 10k it would be great


[05-Feb-25 05:40 AM] laaxus#0000
Honestly, at at point, might as well just take a loan


[05-Feb-25 05:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
And make a base myself?


[05-Feb-25 05:40 AM] laaxus#0000
and make a SME base for example


[05-Feb-25 05:40 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
AL is low risk low income


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
will always sell


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
but profit is low (hence why I don't have SME)


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
I made a plan for a HAL base not too long ago


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
AL != HAL


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
?


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
Huh


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] laaxus#0000
AL is alluminium


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
Ohhh


[05-Feb-25 05:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
Hal is the ore?


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] laaxus#0000
yes


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
Oh lmao


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
For my standards the profit looked solid


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
Conparable to my DW base


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] laaxus#0000
HAL has high profits


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] laaxus#0000
but high shipping cost


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] laaxus#0000
so lower profits overall


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
Fair


[05-Feb-25 05:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
My shipping costs are extravagant


[05-Feb-25 05:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
Maybe 10k a day?


[05-Feb-25 05:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
On just fuel


[05-Feb-25 05:43 AM] pagy1234#0000
Il weight my options


[05-Feb-25 05:44 AM] laaxus#0000
shipping cost is not only fuel


[05-Feb-25 05:45 AM] laaxus#0000
it's about shipping capacity


[05-Feb-25 05:46 AM] laaxus#0000
if you need one whole ship doing trip back and forth constantly


[05-Feb-25 05:46 AM] laaxus#0000
then the cost of that ship should be included in the base cost


[05-Feb-25 06:01 AM] magican1980#0000
If I want to make a new H2O and DW Base I look for - How much must I invest in HQ (atm. 3 Mio) - how much I need to invest in the bases (H2O + FP) ~2-2.5 Mio - Need I a new ship, yes LCB ~5-6 Mio ... So I need a investment of about 10-12 Mio


[05-Feb-25 06:01 AM] laaxus#0000
you should also evaluates the risk


[05-Feb-25 06:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
maaaann, i liked it better when fuel was the only costüòÜ
I have a second ship I can still upgrade to massively expand my shipping potential


[05-Feb-25 06:14 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats def the next thing il do if shipping becomes a constraint


[05-Feb-25 06:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
but since produce RAT on the side of DW my shipping usage has gone down a decent chunk


[05-Feb-25 06:18 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Everything has an opportunity cost.  You also have the cost of your time preplanning a base.  If it is more fun for you to ignore that, you can. üôÇ


[05-Feb-25 06:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah ik ik, im just joking around, for now im better off expanding my current bases to 500 area though so most of that isnt part of my costs, will be a while till I get another ship i think


[05-Feb-25 06:21 AM] magican1980#0000
On the planets you produce your items you get over time experts, use them. with 4 experts up to 20 % Bonus


[05-Feb-25 06:21 AM] pagy1234#0000
i have 4 on my FP base :D


[05-Feb-25 06:24 AM] magican1980#0000
your are new here and dont let it stress you. expand your base slowly. If you need help, ask. There are lot older people out there who can help answer your questions.


[05-Feb-25 06:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, thanks


[05-Feb-25 06:52 AM] magican1980#0000

i don't know about insanely


[05-Feb-25 10:24 AM] jcheung#0000
but i think a lot of us started with leased bases


[05-Feb-25 10:26 AM] jcheung#0000
i was tossing around the idea of leasing bases from people for 75-100k/day but i need more ships before i could ever do that


[05-Feb-25 10:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
for 100k a day its surely better to just buy your HQ levels, right?


[05-Feb-25 10:46 AM] laaxus#0000
100k a day ????


[05-Feb-25 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
A week you mean right ? Lol


[05-Feb-25 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
A fair Price imo is 50k


[05-Feb-25 10:47 AM] laaxus#0000
70k is a steal


[05-Feb-25 10:50 AM] pagy1234#0000
I could certainly provide a permit for 10% of what ever you produce there per week :D (T+C's apply üòõ )


[05-Feb-25 10:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
serious offer btw, not my usuall tomfoolery


[05-Feb-25 10:58 AM] jcheung#0000
no, a day.


[05-Feb-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
Why would you pay 100k a day for a lease ??


[05-Feb-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
100k would be one of the best possible base

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[05-Feb-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
You could just put a bid for that Price lol


[05-Feb-25 11:01 AM] jcheung#0000
1) someone who is leasing out their base needs it more than i do-it's not all about profits
2) price stability is actually really nice
3) there's actually several things i would never want from the CX but i would take on planet for a premium


[05-Feb-25 11:02 AM] laaxus#0000
You could still pay 60k, and it would be a very good Price


[05-Feb-25 11:02 AM] jcheung#0000
also, being paid above CX would incentivize the person to renew


[05-Feb-25 11:02 AM] laaxus#0000
I would have kept a 60k leased base for like 6-9 months


[05-Feb-25 11:03 AM] jcheung#0000
uh huh. and how long would you keep a 100k leased base for


[05-Feb-25 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
Forever ? Lol


[05-Feb-25 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
100k risk free ???


[05-Feb-25 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
Ofc I take it


[05-Feb-25 11:03 AM] jcheung#0000
in other words, i don't have to worry about replacing you on short notice?


[05-Feb-25 11:04 AM] jcheung#0000
my supply is guaranteed, i don't have to ship really bulky items 2 days away?


[05-Feb-25 11:09 AM] pagy1234#0000
~~I can do the same for 95k !~~


[05-Feb-25 11:09 AM] laaxus#0000
Unless I quit the game, and even then I would give a 1 month notice


[05-Feb-25 11:09 AM] laaxus#0000
do you plan to take pro ?


[05-Feb-25 11:09 AM] pagy1234#0000

[05-Feb-25 11:09 AM] jcheung#0000

That planet doesn't have the infrastructure to really support TECs at this time. Looks like about 400k price tag for the PAR we'll need. TEC immigration will cost about 50k a week, with approx 3 weeks to fill the TEC need. I will not have access to GOV until after this next POPR

[06-Feb-25 05:46 AM] tanda#0000
Understandable. It probably is time to get some higher value industry on there. TSH cost is kinda steep for PIO/SET only


[06-Feb-25 03:53 PM] laaxus#0000
Could you give me the shopping list for the required PAR please ?

[08-Feb-25 04:34 AM] laaxus#0000
My sheet is broken


[08-Feb-25 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
and I don't know why


[08-Feb-25 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm crying


[08-Feb-25 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
time to redo it I guess


[08-Feb-25 04:48 AM] laaxus#0000
Nah, I honestly am not motivated enough


[08-Feb-25 08:24 AM] jcheung#0000
Can't backtrace?


[08-Feb-25 08:38 AM] laaxus#0000
The logic did not change


[08-Feb-25 08:38 AM] laaxus#0000
The sheet has been unchanged for 5 month


[08-Feb-25 08:39 AM] laaxus#0000
but for some reason, it stopped working correctly


[08-Feb-25 08:48 AM] jcheung#0000
Again, find an error and backtrace it üòú 
One of the more common errors i see is accidentally dragging a cell over an input cell


[08-Feb-25 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
honestly, the sheet is such a spagethi


[08-Feb-25 08:48 AM] laaxus#0000
And I created it so long ago


[08-Feb-25 08:49 AM] laaxus#0000
it's hard


[08-Feb-25 08:49 AM] jcheung#0000
Heh


[08-Feb-25 08:50 AM] jcheung#0000
One last thing. If it was unchanged for 5 months, go back in the change log and revert to a version 2 months ago


[08-Feb-25 08:51 AM] laaxus#0000
it's not a change that made the error


[08-Feb-25 08:51 AM] jcheung#0000
Just do it to see if it was an unintentional change


[08-Feb-25 08:51 AM] laaxus#0000
it's an error coming from a non handeled case


[08-Feb-25 08:51 AM] laaxus#0000
already tried


[08-Feb-25 08:51 AM] jcheung#0000
Eh? Did the input data structure change?


[08-Feb-25 08:53 AM] laaxus#0000
not the structure


[08-Feb-25 08:53 AM] laaxus#0000
sometimes, values are missing and the like


[08-Feb-25 08:55 AM] jcheung#0000
Huh...


[08-Feb-25 08:56 AM] jcheung#0000
Don't have to answer this, but what did the sheet do again?


[08-Feb-25 08:57 AM] laaxus#0000
Oh I might have found the culprit


[08-Feb-25 08:58 AM] laaxus#0000
oh, found it


[08-Feb-25 08:58 AM] jcheung#0000
Take it out back and put er down


[08-Feb-25 08:58 AM] laaxus#0000
somehow, there's one more line in the prices sheet imported from fio


[08-Feb-25 08:58 AM] jcheung#0000
HCB probably

[08-Feb-25 03:48 PM] potaterror#0000
Got two permits spent on undeveloped planets because I've put empire rework behind making a proper sheet that'll actually import inventory and market data, and looking at discussions like this just immediately slots the task into the same mental labor pool as teaching myself a new CAD program or setting up pfsense, or Koha, or digesting building codes. 

On the plus side, that probably means a gateway network will be up before I do it!


[08-Feb-25 03:51 PM] tanda#0000

[14-Feb-25 11:59 PM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'm torn between expanding Deimos and topping up to the 500 area, and focusing on Prominator, and import my DW, and RAT to Deimos. I also have plans to expand Deimos to 750 area and have it produce it's own C, and more AL making the base much more efficient and reducing my shipping costs by a ton. As of right now I am moving my current surplus from Prom to Deimos but it's not enough to fully supply the base.


[15-Feb-25 12:01 AM] jcheung#0000
what's holding you back


[15-Feb-25 12:01 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'm in a state where I'm just going to be collecting some wealth from my current bases as it is a decent amount and save up about 500k. I should only need about 250k to expand either base. I'm producing about 75 AL a day rn


[15-Feb-25 12:02 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I just need to pick a direction to focus on as I shouldnt do both ta once


[15-Feb-25 12:02 AM] jcheung#0000
how's your shipping


[15-Feb-25 12:02 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I am using 1 ship, not all the time


[15-Feb-25 12:02 AM] jcheung#0000
and how do you feel about loans (not from me)


[15-Feb-25 12:03 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'm open to loans, but I'm in no rush, I got the AGP grant to setup my Deimos base not too long ago, it'll take a week maybe for me to raise my target funds


[15-Feb-25 12:03 AM] jcheung#0000
there's a few people that you can get loans at decent rates from


[15-Feb-25 12:03 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Yeah I may look into that more, but I still need to decide what base to focus on next lol


[15-Feb-25 12:04 AM] jcheung#0000
the one that's cheaper to run


[15-Feb-25 12:04 AM] jcheung#0000
or one with better ROI


[15-Feb-25 12:05 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
That'd be prom as I'm only buying OVE to operate the base, but I feel Deimos will be more profit


[15-Feb-25 12:05 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I've done a prun planner on both


[15-Feb-25 12:05 AM] jcheung#0000
why only OVE


[15-Feb-25 12:06 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I am producing DW and RAT and selling them


[15-Feb-25 12:07 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Prom is only using 159 area rn, so I'm not using coffee or PWO rn


[15-Feb-25 12:08 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I think my building costs are a lot less if I focus on Deimos, so I'll probably do that


[15-Feb-25 12:11 AM] jcheung#0000
should use PWO


[15-Feb-25 12:11 AM] jcheung#0000
it's worth it


[15-Feb-25 12:12 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
Yeah you're probably right


[15-Feb-25 12:30 AM] vanarazor#0000
and what about COF


[15-Feb-25 12:31 AM] potaterror#0000
Lux consumables are pretty much always worth it, and if they aren't, it's a real good sign that the base isn't either.


[15-Feb-25 12:33 AM] evov#0000
Prom - buy whatever you need, make HER
Deimos - buy whatever you need, make (whatever you you feel like. AL is always a high volume item)

If cashflow is a concern -

On Prom - I'll give you a 2week contract (I give you $ now, you deliver in 2 weeks)  however much HER you know you'll be able to make at 3000/u

On Deimos - I'll give you a 2 week contract (I give you $ now, you deliver in 2 weeks) however much AL you know you'll be able to make at 800/u

You can deliver these things on planet so you don't need to worry about shipping them off.


[15-Feb-25 12:36 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'd love to make Deimos a 750 area base, I want tall bases as it is better for my time I am able to check in and play


[15-Feb-25 12:36 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Do it


[15-Feb-25 12:37 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I plan to, just need to roll in the cash over time :p


[15-Feb-25 12:38 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I already for the materials for my HQ upgrade, so in a week or so I'll have the funds to upgrade the buildings


[15-Feb-25 12:38 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
I'ma make so much AL :p


[15-Feb-25 12:39 AM] .urpalhal#0000
You could take up EvoV‚Äôs offer to get some cash and add a few buildings


[15-Feb-25 01:01 AM] mzevilcanadian#0000
75/day now over 2 weeks is 840k, and I need about 600k in materials to expand it to the 750 area plan, but i'll be producing 107 per day which equates to about 1.2 mil


[15-Feb-25 01:23 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean put together a plan and ask? Worst he can say is no

[15-Feb-25 04:45 PM] tanda#0000
So as an update. I've gone ahead and ran a TEC immigration for A2A, as well as dropped and supplied a PAR. Archiel's sheet suggests that we'll see an increase of 110 TECs next POPR


[15-Feb-25 04:46 PM] tanda#0000
I'm planning on maintaining roughly the same fulfilment/growth/unemployment levels as YK-266c, so as to make the planet attractive overall for players

Righto. If you wanna send me conts for 80%ish of market whenever you want it (if you don't find them at a better price), I'll deliver at ANT.


[16-Feb-25 12:53 AM] tanda#0000

[26-Feb-25 05:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
After CULT, which currently focuses on a variety of markets, and the newly founded Project CORGI, which focuses primarily on lfabs and rfabs, I would like to suggest another initiative I‚Äôm already working towards:

the Antarean Resource Extraction Service, or ARES (thank you Laaxus for not taking that acronym üòÖ)

The goal is to provide a stable and reliable metal prices and the required infrastructure to produce those, since they are the base of many industries and something we Antareans are good in (looking at Deimos and Vulcan üëÄ ). 

In my experience I noticed,  that all metals (except maybe AL) are kinda falling between the scope of early and end game. It requires an enormous amount of shipping, which makes it impossible for newer players, and at the same time returns a relative low profit, which doesn‚Äôt make it attractive for established players.

This project aims for the following goals:

- a well established trade route network for ore and metal transportation between selected extraction and smelting planets
-  fixed 50k profit/permit for resource extraction and smelting bases, resulting in the lowest possible CX price for metals 
- support programs additionally to the AGP to recruit newer players


[26-Feb-25 05:03 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm not a fan of the fixed 50k per permit
We need people outside of the ADI participating in such a large market


[26-Feb-25 05:06 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm planning a leased base program which would be something like the following
- contract is on a 45d basis, renewable
- first term pay is 35k/d, others are at 50k
- The lender doesn't have to give the base back once the contract ends


[26-Feb-25 06:25 PM] jvaler#0000
50k per permit is kinda just what the market averages to from what i've seen, but i feel like that's way too low for metallurgy and resource extraction. they're some of the most logistically demanding industries and they aren't compensated enough for it

{Reactions}
üëÜ (2) 

[26-Feb-25 06:27 PM] jvaler#0000
well at least AL is usually around 50k, resource extraction is often around 70k

Ore extraction and smelting are all PIO bases, so I don‚Äôt think you can push out much profit out of them


[27-Feb-25 01:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
AL is quite well established, probably because we have many new players starting with AL.


[27-Feb-25 01:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Tho we could establish more ALO extraction and transport to Deimos to reduce logistical need and rise the profit a bit


[27-Feb-25 01:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I‚Äôm sitting on the CU and AU market. There isn‚Äôt much movement there, so I don‚Äôt feel we need much more of it atm.


[27-Feb-25 01:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The other ones (SI, LI, FE and STL) are more or less a Blackbox for me atm


[27-Feb-25 06:14 AM] laaxus#0000
My vision for an ADI ship project would be the following


[27-Feb-25 06:14 AM] laaxus#0000
we separate the parts into willing members


[27-Feb-25 06:14 AM] laaxus#0000
and then we sell the parts on the market


[27-Feb-25 06:14 AM] laaxus#0000
(nothing stop us from selling parts with a discount on the internal market)


[27-Feb-25 06:15 AM] laaxus#0000
The goal would be to allow players to buy and build ships at a competitive price


[27-Feb-25 06:15 AM] laaxus#0000
without the need to go through the AFO


[27-Feb-25 06:18 AM] realharvey#0000
Cheap ship materials on the CX will just get soaked up by other ship builders or resold at higher pricepoints


[27-Feb-25 06:20 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Afaik EvoV is selling his ships for less then the individual parts are worth (how much he would get, if he sells the parts on the market)


[27-Feb-25 06:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Rise once complained Evovs prices are too high, so he probably had similar schemes


[27-Feb-25 06:21 AM] realharvey#0000
evo still has quite a high fast delivery tax on his prices in comparrison to other offers


[27-Feb-25 06:23 AM] pxlfox.#0000
One niche would be the parts ship builds aren‚Äôt including in there prefabed ships


[27-Feb-25 06:24 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Tho Archiel could probably tell more about how useful some parts are or not


[27-Feb-25 06:25 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm not saying we should sell them cheap on the cx


[27-Feb-25 06:25 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm saying we should sell them at a competitive price


[27-Feb-25 06:25 AM] laaxus#0000
EvoV price would be a good start


[27-Feb-25 06:27 AM] realharvey#0000
I never saw Evo run out of stock. So we should aim for atleast 10% lower


[27-Feb-25 06:30 AM] laaxus#0000
ofc we could aim lower


[27-Feb-25 06:33 AM] realharvey#0000
to behonest I believe that PRUN is currently well supplied with ships


[27-Feb-25 06:33 AM] laaxus#0000
Disagree
Else shipbuilders wouldn't have month long waiting list


[27-Feb-25 06:36 AM] tanda#0000
from what I remember being told about OOG's early shiplines, they focused on the money making parts every step of the way. So if something could be sold for good profit by itself before becoming a ship part, they made that and sold it, then turned around and made it into ships later


[27-Feb-25 06:36 AM] tanda#0000
See this is the issue, honestly. One look at AIR alone was enough to discourage me from attempting to pursue shipbulding solo


[27-Feb-25 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
yes, ideally, we should be able to buy and sell on the cx at every steps


[27-Feb-25 06:40 AM] laaxus#0000
while making money


[27-Feb-25 06:40 AM] realharvey#0000
this is not true tho. I've currently waited 5-14 days until delivery. Evo has still stock, even OOG still has stock currently.


[27-Feb-25 06:41 AM] realharvey#0000
yeah I tried to plan multiple things, but I always gave up midway through.


[27-Feb-25 06:42 AM] laaxus#0000
I just wished buying parts on the market wasn't so pricy


[27-Feb-25 06:44 AM] realharvey#0000
What we are currently lacking are super competetive priced ships like Rise did. But most of his permits where priced at 60k profit per day. Which is quite low when looking at other stuff


[27-Feb-25 07:05 AM] zillatron#0000
The answer isn't cheaper ships, it's making more money to buy them

[27-Feb-25 07:50 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm starting to worry at like 3M of liquidity left

yep I have about the same range


[27-Feb-25 07:53 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Low cash balance just means you're maximizing your equity towards generating profit.


[27-Feb-25 07:53 AM] laaxus#0000
Low cash balance makes you vulnerable to market unstability


[27-Feb-25 07:53 AM] laaxus#0000
you might have to sell at bid and not at ask


[27-Feb-25 07:54 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I only make things that are profitable to sell at bid üôÇ


[27-Feb-25 07:54 AM] laaxus#0000
Idem


[27-Feb-25 07:54 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I just had a few days go by when I was above 5k cash balance.  I don't know what to do with all this money! üôÇ


[27-Feb-25 07:54 AM] laaxus#0000
that's what I'm always recommending


[27-Feb-25 07:54 AM] laaxus#0000
but selling at ask ... is how you can make even more profit with the same production


[27-Feb-25 07:55 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
Sure, that's just one way to maximize your equity to generate profit though (by having less cash)


[27-Feb-25 07:56 AM] random_di5cord_user#0000
I guess, technically, I do make some PWO which frequently isn't profitable to sell at bid, but its a very small amount of my equity and it moves fast regardless.  (and I'm vertically integrated, so I'm not subject to ask prices for inputs until we look at things like worker fuel).


[27-Feb-25 11:03 AM] realharvey#0000
I have daily costs of 7 Mil, so I need to have quite a bit of liquidity


[27-Feb-25 11:12 AM] evany.#0000
to be fair pricing like that only works when your so big that you can eat the losses elsewhere

as someone that has spent a great deal of time going over ship production/pricing and trying to work out some equity - my baseline for psk was everyone would get 50k/day for their permit and while i think that has been true/successful (its been about 90days actually probably worthy of an audit) i still couldn't come anywhere near rise's prices.

theres a reason he had such a big wait list and thats because he was likely selling at a loss for many things


[27-Feb-25 11:31 AM] realharvey#0000
rise and his minions did produce everything themselfs. So nothing really was bought from the market


[27-Feb-25 11:41 AM] evany.#0000
yeah we have very few things being picked up from CX, only when things didn't make sense to drop a base for basically.


[27-Feb-25 11:41 AM] evany.#0000
basically if CX was cheaper than dropping a base, you pick from CX, and that turned out to be true at the time for several things


[27-Feb-25 11:43 AM] evany.#0000
and its worth noting when i started the adi ship project my goal was 50k/base, i didn't really hold myself to that standard though, my 3 permits bases pull me around 10k/day each


[27-Feb-25 11:43 AM] evany.#0000
and our prices are still quite above schaitr's by about 100-150k


[27-Feb-25 11:44 AM] realharvey#0000

To answer some questions that had come up: Ship building is a bit of a weird market.

Some people are hesitant to buy ships on the CX because:
* It's an overwhelming quantity of items to buy
* They don't want to go through the design process, which is genuinely hard and confusing.
* They don't want to buy half a ship then find out the bridge they need is out of stock.

Prices are high on the CX, I'm not really sure why. Probably because supply is really thin. And they may or may not take forever to sell.

Selling bundles can be tough because it's hard to keep the parts in balance.. but it's also a good way to sell things I have too much of. Like 2 years ago I made 150 LFE and I'm still working through that pile. So I can buy fuel tanks at way above my costs and sale price if it means I can move 4m of other goods. 

I usually have 20 ships worth of certain materials, then have a bottleneck in just a few. For a big player, it's easy to absorb that capital cost and be sure you'll eventually sell it. I buy a ton of ship parts up front, which helps out the producer... then I just hope I can balance it out later.

i don't know about other feeder bases, but my rise bases were ~40k/d/permit

which left a lot of room for cost cutting


[27-Feb-25 06:38 PM] jcheung#0000
couple of mine were 25-40k/d

correction, 35-40k


[27-Feb-25 07:27 PM] tanda#0000
I just did a 50k/day permit and I gotta say looking around at options new players have, I don't think 50k/d/permit is really price competitive for most new players

1.5 billion sales 
300 million orders..
(just on NC1)


[04-Mar-25 05:36 AM] evov#0000
I use the CX, but for the most part I think I'm more likely to be classified as an industrialist of sorts.
On the CX I think I've got about 200m in sales, 100m in buys. But the stock sitting in my warehouses waiting to be used for productive stuff, has an extra comma.

I think lowstrife is the king of the CX. I'm not sure who would dispute that one. Maybe allocater?


[04-Mar-25 07:05 AM] pagy1234#0000
unfortunately, allocator isnt even close


[04-Mar-25 07:08 AM] pagy1234#0000
both have about the same in buy orders, but lowstrife has almost 5x allocators sell orders


[04-Mar-25 01:12 PM] thinkrhino#0000
So if I'm looking at these numbers correctly, it's more profitable for me to grow MAI than it is to produce Carbon. The limitation being that farmsteads require more space and workers. I'm guessing thats where C pushes ahead in profitability?


[04-Mar-25 01:13 PM] thinkrhino#0000
I guess long term, space in my cargo holds too.


[04-Mar-25 01:15 PM] jcheung#0000
I mean if you're looking to grow something in frms for profit


[04-Mar-25 01:15 PM] jcheung#0000
HER was doing pretty damn good for a bit


[04-Mar-25 01:22 PM] thinkrhino#0000
Yeah, it looks like HER is way more profitable than MAI, it just requires that I have capital to buy DDT


[04-Mar-25 01:22 PM] jcheung#0000
I can loan you some


[04-Mar-25 01:23 PM] jcheung#0000
Ddt that is


[04-Mar-25 01:25 PM] thinkrhino#0000
If you're feeling generous I will accept your generosity


[04-Mar-25 01:25 PM] jcheung#0000
It may have to wait until I'm back at my home pc though as i don't feel like looking up DDT info right now


[04-Mar-25 01:25 PM] jcheung#0000
Unless you want to do the homework for me


[04-Mar-25 01:26 PM] thinkrhino#0000
No rush, I'll just be farming my potatoes


[04-Mar-25 01:26 PM] jcheung#0000
Isn't MAI corn


[04-Mar-25 01:27 PM] thinkrhino#0000
yeah but thematically I'm assuming that HCP = potatos


[04-Mar-25 01:27 PM] thinkrhino#0000
Lots of starch


[04-Mar-25 01:28 PM] jcheung#0000
Could be grass


[04-Mar-25 01:29 PM] jcheung#0000
Specifically, switchgrass


[04-Mar-25 01:29 PM] thinkrhino#0000
Could be.


[06-Mar-25 09:16 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Hey


[06-Mar-25 09:16 AM] jab.sh#0000
@infinit3kr could I talk you into starting over on Deimos and setting up either an EXT/COL base or a SME (AL) base?


[06-Mar-25 09:17 AM] jab.sh#0000
if you look at the last message in #bulletin-board there's more details there on the bases we're looking for


[06-Mar-25 09:18 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Could I keep what I have so far as well I sort of like seeing what I have been working on growing also


[06-Mar-25 09:19 AM] jab.sh#0000
unfortunately no, Deimos is full so the only way to get there now is to start over


[06-Mar-25 09:19 AM] laaxus#0000
I think he's a very new player


[06-Mar-25 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
most player restart after a week or so, once they gained knowledge they were lacking


[06-Mar-25 09:20 AM] laaxus#0000
maybe ask him at that time ?


[06-Mar-25 09:20 AM] jab.sh#0000
indeed which is why I'm asking üòÅ


[06-Mar-25 09:21 AM] infinit3kr#0000
I‚Äôve already done that unfortunately lol üòÇ I took a while to learn a lot


[06-Mar-25 09:21 AM] laaxus#0000
If I was a new player, I wouldn't like people telling me what to do ...


[06-Mar-25 09:21 AM] infinit3kr#0000
I‚Äôve done 2 coliq in the process lmao now I finally have a good understanding of everything


[06-Mar-25 09:22 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes, deimos is full, so you can't have a base there *right away*


[06-Mar-25 09:22 AM] laaxus#0000
but there's no FOMO to have tbh


[06-Mar-25 09:22 AM] laaxus#0000
did 3 üòÑ


[06-Mar-25 09:22 AM] jab.sh#0000
it's not fomo, it's ease of logistics


[06-Mar-25 09:22 AM] jab.sh#0000
we need ALO and O and AL and you can do all 3 on Deimos


[06-Mar-25 09:23 AM] infinit3kr#0000
I mean I‚Äôm not really making a lot so I don‚Äôt have much to lose but seeing that I have it running smoothly and profitable feels like an accomplishment lol


[06-Mar-25 09:24 AM] infinit3kr#0000
Worked hard on making it perfect lol

until your 4th base or so, every base should still be profitable in the worst case


[06-Mar-25 10:17 AM] laaxus#0000
you want to be able to sell at bid

prices will keep falling if production increases more


[06-Mar-25 10:36 AM] infinit3kr#0000
At the rate I would be producing to start I dont see a cause for detrimental impact on that unless it was a very very high volume


[06-Mar-25 10:40 AM] infinit3kr#0000
the last candle is pointing to a reverse in trend also look how its starting at the base of the red and moving upwards  which hasnt been seen for a while


[06-Mar-25 10:40 AM] infinit3kr#0000
the other bullish candles were just compensation for bear runs


[06-Mar-25 10:41 AM] infinit3kr#0000
so i still think it would be a good opportunity at this point to get in on it

looking at the bigger picture youre seeing it hitting a support line


[06-Mar-25 10:43 AM] infinit3kr#0000
which indicates a reversal on trend approacing which could be a good buy and hold for people also at this point


[06-Mar-25 11:03 AM] jcheung#0000
That's not true, markets can change even outside of those bands-but it sure does mitigate the whiplash


[06-Mar-25 11:03 AM] jcheung#0000
Specifically looking at you NL, dropping almost 30% overnight after being stable at a price for months >.> coincidentally when my first full shipload of NL made it to market to sell


[06-Mar-25 11:04 AM] jab.sh#0000
so it's your fault


[06-Mar-25 11:05 AM] jcheung#0000
No, i hadn't sold yet. It arrived and i went to sell and then went "well, better let lowstrife know I'm gonna be missing payments"

the support line is has formed from small producers seling at bid price when their need quick cash, alot of markets show a simmilar pattern since major producers almost always put an ask price.


[06-Mar-25 11:12 AM] pagy1234#0000

~~the bid price barely moves since its at a nice round number that people keep reverting too~~ Allocator has a pretty large bid there so people slowly are filling it up


[06-Mar-25 11:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
but as for ask price its just producers undercutting each other


[06-Mar-25 11:15 AM] infinit3kr#0000
being highly profitable eben from bid prices i have confidence in the plan

[06-Mar-25 11:29 AM] getonthetrain#0000
just be aware that SCN is about the only thing profitable on EDM's so you'll lack an ability to switch recipes

yes i have seen that but im going to stick with that at this point and expand if, if future opportunites arise I will have enough liquid biffer to be able to transition

I'm not sure because it would use 3 permits for  1 planet which I heard is not advised however nascent seems to be the best place to extract ALO near by, I could be producing 4 K AL /week.

a SME base on DEIMOS to produce AL


[07-Mar-25 02:31 PM] laaxus#0000
why do you want to produce AFAB ?


[07-Mar-25 02:31 PM] laaxus#0000
what's the goal you have in mind ?


[07-Mar-25 02:32 PM] vanarazor#0000
I feel like starting to produce AFAB would allow me great profits and a way of stocking them up for future builds


[07-Mar-25 02:32 PM] igfloz#0000
Deimos is full right now. Do you already have a base or CM there ?


[07-Mar-25 02:33 PM] vanarazor#0000
nope, what do you mean we can;t build on deimos anymore ? üòÆ


[07-Mar-25 02:33 PM] igfloz#0000
Deimos is one of the starter planets. It can be difficult to get a permit there


[07-Mar-25 02:33 PM] vanarazor#0000
I ll have to hunt for a coGC METtallurgy planet near by then

[07-Mar-25 02:38 PM] igfloz#0000
Laxxus is right ! A-fabs need R-fabs and other stuff. It'll be hell to make a profit - and take months to see any real money


[07-Mar-25 02:38 PM] vanarazor#0000
BBH seems to be in high demand and Bid amount reached market maker


[07-Mar-25 02:40 PM] laaxus#0000
if you want to start building fabs, I would recommend a PP2 base


[07-Mar-25 02:40 PM] igfloz#0000
BBH / BSE etc. is commonly used in what we call green planets. Those with nominal temperature and pressure. Most starter bases use the B-fabs , so it's not a bad business to get into


[07-Mar-25 02:40 PM] laaxus#0000
A PP2 base produces Bfabs and Lfabs


[07-Mar-25 02:41 PM] laaxus#0000
and currently, there are just not enough LFabs being produced


[07-Mar-25 02:41 PM] igfloz#0000

[07-Mar-25 02:43 PM] vanarazor#0000
the only thing is I think about I would need to acquire a bigger ship first


[07-Mar-25 02:43 PM] laaxus#0000
The con of producing Lfabs is that it doesn't have a large bid to sell into
but you will be able to use the LFabs to upgrade your own HQ, which is equivalent of selling at ask


[07-Mar-25 02:43 PM] laaxus#0000
yes, you should have upgraded at least one of your ship before starting a PP2 base


[07-Mar-25 02:44 PM] igfloz#0000
Just moving the ALO / AL is going to be a task ! They are both quite heavy


[07-Mar-25 02:44 PM] laaxus#0000
no need to put 4 3s on the PP2 orders


[07-Mar-25 02:45 PM] laaxus#0000
GL is quite cheap, so I would recommend buying it from the market


[07-Mar-25 02:45 PM] vanarazor#0000

well realistically I'd need a bigger ship &the liquidity for the construction materials


[07-Mar-25 02:49 PM] vanarazor#0000
so ideally don't build unless 50K profit?

even buying at ask price, CHP cl base are very profitable

I understand people's desire to help and provide input. But . . .  there's a lot of advice that gets given in discords that is. . . . .  not entirely accurate.

BFabs, LFabs, RFabs, AFabs - have absolutely nothing to do with the type of planet. Hot, cold, High pressure, low pressure .... has zero impact on the fabs that get used. These are core building blocks for buildings. The "tier" of fab tends to go up along with the "tier" of workforce.

Another very profitable and secure base is POL

[08-Mar-25 09:13 AM] tanda#0000
Nike, Aceland or Nike jr


[08-Mar-25 09:13 AM] tanda#0000
No other planet really had the pop


[08-Mar-25 10:43 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Nike Jr?


[08-Mar-25 10:44 AM] tanda#0000
ZV-194b


[08-Mar-25 10:44 AM] tanda#0000
it's right next to Nike, but not as developed


[08-Mar-25 10:44 AM] tanda#0000
hence Nike jr


[08-Mar-25 10:44 AM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah I know where Nike jr is I just didn‚Äôt think it had enough pop for pp4


[08-Mar-25 10:44 AM] tanda#0000
it does have ENG, so it could support it

What would be the best planet for a CHP base in Antares space?


[08-Mar-25 10:55 AM] jvaler#0000
probably griffonstone


[08-Mar-25 10:56 AM] jvaler#0000
that or origo if you prefer to pay extra for SEA to be closer to the CX


[08-Mar-25 10:57 AM] jvaler#0000
there's also electronica but it's a bit far


[08-Mar-25 10:57 AM] tanda#0000
All solid options


[08-Mar-25 11:02 AM] ballpython2777#0000
if I did setup on griffonstone, what product should I make with the CHPs? On prunplanner SC looks the best but I'm curious on what most people do


[08-Mar-25 11:02 AM] .urpalhal#0000
CL


[08-Mar-25 11:03 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I do FLX and NS as well


[08-Mar-25 11:03 AM] laaxus#0000
I would recommend griffonstone


[08-Mar-25 11:04 AM] laaxus#0000
later on, you could do the Halcyon -> Griffonstone (CL) -> Origo (EPO) -> Antares shipping route


[08-Mar-25 11:04 AM] sidepipe#0000
CL, FLX and NS are all solid options - I haven‚Äôt looked at profitability for them recently, but CL especially is always in demand


[08-Mar-25 11:05 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think FLX tends to be less profitable than the other two


[08-Mar-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
CL will always always be in demand


[08-Mar-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
and profitable


[08-Mar-25 11:05 AM] tanda#0000
NS should be really good right now


[08-Mar-25 11:05 AM] laaxus#0000
don't know about the other


[08-Mar-25 11:06 AM] tanda#0000
I recommend CL. It's boring, but the shipping is low


[08-Mar-25 11:06 AM] ballpython2777#0000
on prunplanner NS seems to be the best out of those three


[08-Mar-25 11:06 AM] ballpython2777#0000
makes sense


[08-Mar-25 11:06 AM] laaxus#0000
if you take the CL path, please buy your HAL at Halcyon, not the cx


[08-Mar-25 11:07 AM] sidepipe#0000
NS is definitely gonna be profitable right now because it‚Äôs in a shortage, but I think the inputs for it are less stable than CL. But there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from switching recipes üôÇ

Switching recipe is good if you want to profit short term
If you want a recipe that will profitable now and in 6 months, take CL

See how you can't go wrong with CHP ? üòÑ

Yeah he will answer your DMs

I thought rise said he was going to complete any outstanding ship orders. He's a very reasonable guy in my experience, DM him and im sure you'll be able to work something out.

Do you really need 318 EXO per day ? The CX movement isn't that good if you are looking to sell your extras


[15-Mar-25 04:57 PM] laaxus#0000
ok I think one day (which means probably never) I'll do a power point presentation on why producing everything yourself doesn't make things cheaper

[15-Mar-25 04:58 PM] vanarazor#0000
nah I only need 11 /d EXO


[15-Mar-25 04:58 PM] igfloz#0000
If everyone is vertical building..... essentially, there won't be a CX lol


[15-Mar-25 05:00 PM] laaxus#0000
ok @vanarazor, which of the following base is the best (assuming equal cost and shipping etc)
- A base producing 100k AIC profit per day in cash
- A base producing 50k profit per day in consummables


[15-Mar-25 05:01 PM] igfloz#0000
I used to advertise on the internal market ( there are some people that I still honor sales to) - but essentially, I just drop a bunch every now and then on the CX.............. My numbers are small in the galactic scale, there are much bigger fish here üôÇ

[15-Mar-25 05:01 PM] vanarazor#0000
I'd say the one that gives more profits per day


[15-Mar-25 05:01 PM] laaxus#0000
exactly


[15-Mar-25 05:01 PM] laaxus#0000
because with 100k cash


[15-Mar-25 05:01 PM] laaxus#0000
you can buy 50k worth of consummables


[15-Mar-25 05:01 PM] laaxus#0000
and still have 50k AIC


[15-Mar-25 05:01 PM] vanarazor#0000
but the one that gives more profits also cost more to build


[15-Mar-25 05:02 PM] laaxus#0000
not necessarily


[15-Mar-25 05:02 PM] laaxus#0000
anyway


[15-Mar-25 05:02 PM] laaxus#0000
my point is


[15-Mar-25 05:02 PM] laaxus#0000
producing things you need doesn't make them cheaper


[15-Mar-25 05:03 PM] laaxus#0000
producing things you need, allow you to sell with the convenience of bid, at ask price for the base producing it, and stock stability for the base consumming it


[15-Mar-25 05:03 PM] laaxus#0000
it doesn't make the good cheaper


[15-Mar-25 05:04 PM] laaxus#0000
because the price of the good is and always is the market price


[15-Mar-25 05:05 PM] laaxus#0000
Again, I'm not stopping you to do it, or forcing you to play a certain way. You should do what's fun to you.
But I have to make sure you're not misunderstanding the situation


[15-Mar-25 05:07 PM] vanarazor#0000
I hear you


[15-Mar-25 05:08 PM] laaxus#0000
Anyway, one thing I recommend to do  for every players, is to do a full base for every building in prunplanner
This allows you to see possible profitable bases you didnt know of


[15-Mar-25 05:08 PM] tanda#0000
opportunity cost is really hard to keep in mind when doing any build


[15-Mar-25 05:10 PM] jcheung#0000
There's also a price to stability


[15-Mar-25 05:11 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah for now I try to stay in the settlers building level as higher tier building cost more to build and to fill consumables


[15-Mar-25 05:11 PM] vanarazor#0000
I thought  producing consumables would reduce my cost for now and in the future


[15-Mar-25 05:12 PM] jcheung#0000
For the counterpoint to laaxus's argument (he has really good point, just want to make sure the other side is shown)
Would you rather a base that makes 180k sometimes, but other times makes 30k, for an average of 100k cash?
Or would you rather a base that makes "75k" in consumables consistently

[15-Mar-25 05:13 PM] tanda#0000
I'm definitely in the middle ground here: I think everyone should have a BMP base, but they're not consistently profitable. Sometimes you're going to make a very tiny margin just to keep your base producing

[15-Mar-25 05:13 PM] jcheung#0000

are you maybe lacking ideas of what to build ?


[15-Mar-25 05:27 PM] vanarazor#0000
if it was possible I like the idea of producing everything but for now we ll stick to where is profit and convenient enough to fit in my weekly schedule


[15-Mar-25 05:27 PM] vanarazor#0000
I try to stay in the settlers ier of building as higher tier cost more to build and maintain in terms of consumables


[15-Mar-25 05:27 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Why not Origo for POL?


[15-Mar-25 05:28 PM] vanarazor#0000
why not bober?


[15-Mar-25 05:28 PM] vanarazor#0000
bober is closer to ANT

It's actually production I intend to spool up eventually, it's just way down the line on a bad plan that's a few permits away.

NGL, while I appreciate the spirit of cooperation, it would be cheaper for me to do it

I am gravely insulted by your dismissal of my business opportunity with a ROI right around the heat death of the universe.


[16-Mar-25 12:11 AM] potaterror#0000
It's just a coincidental part of a vanity project I've had on my radar since pretty well when I started. Problem is that it's a small empire's worth of permits, but I'll get there eventually.

[16-Mar-25 12:21 AM] potaterror#0000
Seems a fairly recent development. Maybe I'll buy some in MOR and ferry 'em over as a currency exchange mechanism.


[18-Mar-25 09:47 AM] magican1980#0000
I coming in the range of these cost per permit - I hit HQ 20 yesterday, after this I need 3-5 Millions for the next upgrade ü•∂  and it only goes up


[18-Mar-25 09:49 AM] magican1980#0000
from Level 20 to 25 you need to spend about 60 Mio credits and its going worse ... 20-30 up to 207 Mio


[18-Mar-25 09:50 AM] magican1980#0000
I need to plan and build up my A-Fab Construction planet to support the next expansions üò¶


[18-Mar-25 01:05 PM] potaterror#0000
Might consider the IDC base option as a stable upgrade cash flow or cushion for reorganizing, too.


[18-Mar-25 01:10 PM] potaterror#0000
Finally jumping into that myself to have an income stream that is easy to bump between currencies and substantial/low overhead enough to allow temporarily gutting just about everything else I'm doing, if necessary.


[18-Mar-25 01:12 PM] jcheung#0000
With input prices going up, IDC has been getting closer to some other bases


[18-Mar-25 01:13 PM] jcheung#0000
That said, it's a simple, if expensive base to run


[18-Mar-25 05:01 PM] potaterror#0000
Yeah, I didn't articulate that properly. They're expensive but provide a steady return that can be very hands-off.


[18-Mar-25 05:15 PM] tanda#0000
so if I just restock my EDC bases every 90 days when I repair it'll cost 18mil in one go


[18-Mar-25 05:35 PM] jcheung#0000
I've finally gotten to where i can do my idc base every 45-50 days instead of every other week because of how expensive the inputs are


[18-Mar-25 05:36 PM] jcheung#0000
Hell, my IDC support base makes almost as much as the IDC base does sometimes


[18-Mar-25 05:38 PM] jcheung#0000
(Makes MEA from RAT and HER)


[18-Mar-25 07:51 PM] potaterror#0000
My MEA and WIN production is pretty much entirely vertical, skews the view a bit for me.


[19-Mar-25 02:15 AM] magican1980#0000
yes, I will consider a IDC or EDC Base üôÇ and now I must plan, on what industries I expand to - before that I will need to set up a a-fab and mhl-production base for my future repairs and permit expansion. At this moment I get my profits about 50/50 from Carbon and rats (yes I build up a new expansion with my permits at hortus) ... For Carbon at CX Antares and Benten I expect the prices to stay or drop under 700 credits, because there too much items in the market.


[19-Mar-25 02:15 AM] magican1980#0000
So I will need to look into a good way to burn a good chunck of my Carbon in other productions üôÇ

[19-Mar-25 09:12 AM] sidepipe#0000
Just curious - how do profits / day compare if you leave out the HYF and just focus on making DW? Since you‚Äôre mixing experts anyway, you might make more money focusing on DW rather than spending the area on making a small amount of CAF/COF


[19-Mar-25 09:12 AM] keremcozin#0000
let me see


[19-Mar-25 09:13 AM] jcheung#0000
Or even importing the caf


[19-Mar-25 09:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, buying some CAF wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea if you‚Äôre really attached to making COF. You can just pick some up when it‚Äôs cheap and sneak it into your production line


[19-Mar-25 09:15 AM] keremcozin#0000

beating all others


[19-Mar-25 09:20 AM] sidepipe#0000
That would be my recommendation, personally - HYF are expensive and definitely benefit a ton from the COGC / 5 experts bonus. Having a RIG / FP setup on Boucher gives you a solid foundation to start with, and later on you can move those FP elsewhere, do only rigs on Boucher, and use the water for a future HYF planet üôÇ


[19-Mar-25 09:21 AM] keremcozin#0000
Aye! I'll follow the last more simple but more profitable plan


[19-Mar-25 09:22 AM] sidepipe#0000
The other benefit is that water is shipping intensive, so early on having a combined planet like this is nice. I did the same on Etherwind for a long time üòÑ


[19-Mar-25 09:22 AM] keremcozin#0000
then I started to think, maybe I should stop producing DW and RAT and Promitor? and fully focus on growing agricualtural products there?

[19-Mar-25 09:23 AM] jcheung#0000
As a general rule, unless you absolutely have to, max 2 industries per planet and one should match cogc


[19-Mar-25 09:23 AM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs not a bad idea - in general, as you grow larger, you‚Äôll probably consolidate most of your bases into single-building or single-industry bases


[19-Mar-25 09:24 AM] jcheung#0000
And even then, if you can help it, one industry that matches cogc is preferred

[19-Mar-25 09:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
One thing to keep in mind with Agri goods is that they can be pretty slow to sell


[19-Mar-25 09:27 AM] keremcozin#0000
hmm good to know


[19-Mar-25 09:27 AM] sidepipe#0000
So be careful growing a bunch of one thing if you can‚Äôt also use it, or you might end up with all your money in plants üòÑ


[19-Mar-25 09:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think most people who run FPs run their own farms, or only buy from the market occasionally. And on the other hand, most people who run farms use their own output, and usually just list extra when they have it


[19-Mar-25 09:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
But you should definitely look at the profit difference when you include an extra planet full of FPs to use all those agri goods


[19-Mar-25 09:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
(When you‚Äôre ready to redesign that base, anyway üòÑ)

[19-Mar-25 09:50 AM] keremcozin#0000
also I was making a little amount of C at Harmonia, switched to full HER growing with a single water rig

[19-Mar-25 09:51 AM] keremcozin#0000
ang GRN instead of VEG at Promitor, slightly less profit but GRN sells for different industries, considering "all money in plants" situation üòÑ

Hah, I‚Äôve been exporting some things from Antares to Benten since I had spare ships. Maybe I‚Äôll bring some HAL on the next return flight


[19-Mar-25 10:46 AM] laaxus#0000
Antares prices are lower, so it'd be at a loss if you do it yourself

I usually just take small amounts of lfabs and consumables. I noticed the prices between CI1 and AI1 started really diverging, so I‚Äôm hoping to cut down on exporting by listing some at similar prices to ANT üòÑ


[19-Mar-25 10:49 AM] tanda#0000
I've noticed that too, and it's weird. Some things are cheaper than ANT and MOR by a large margin, which makes little sense

you think Ben LFabs are cheaper ? üò†


[19-Mar-25 10:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
No, they‚Äôre like 2-5k more expensive


[19-Mar-25 10:51 AM] sidepipe#0000
So I‚Äôve been bringing some over and listing them at comparable prices to ANT


[19-Mar-25 10:52 AM] laaxus#0000

[19-Mar-25 10:52 AM] laaxus#0000

so i want to start a base on Benten - Yannick (UV-351b) and bring aqua solutions to Antares


[19-Mar-25 06:42 PM] tanda#0000
hmm, as in import water to ANT? or process the water before shipping?


[19-Mar-25 06:43 PM] batman_project#0000
process


[19-Mar-25 06:44 PM] tanda#0000
I would recommend Etherwind instead. It's a little farther from the CX, but it is less expensive to build on, and more importantly: It has liquid water


[19-Mar-25 06:44 PM] tanda#0000
Yannick has gaseous water, which is harvested by COLlectors rather than RIGs


[19-Mar-25 06:45 PM] batman_project#0000
let me see where that is


[19-Mar-25 06:45 PM] tanda#0000
RIGs are a smaller footprint, letting you fit more of them on a base. It's really hard to overstate how much more productive a RIG base is compared to a COL base

roi is how many days it take to get your investment back

i guess what im saying is i dont really see what the issue is, if you can make a base ROI in 10 days good for you, line go up == good for everyone


[20-Mar-25 08:06 AM] jcheung#0000
So what about the 5d bases


[20-Mar-25 08:06 AM] zillatron#0000
i'm not in the SC or MED markets but just a cursory look making it right off market prices 1150 seems pretty low margin imo


[20-Mar-25 08:06 AM] jcheung#0000
It is


[20-Mar-25 08:07 AM] evov#0000
One thing that should (in theory) change expectations is the average size of the players in the community. More capital available = faster growth... moving up in the permit counts faster. Higher permit counts = more priority given to $/Area/Day compared to RoI.


[20-Mar-25 08:07 AM] zillatron#0000
i dont consider low margin a good thing (overall) personally so that's probably why i find that confusing


[20-Mar-25 08:07 AM] zillatron#0000
if the supply of a thing is fine and people are buying it then the price isnt too high haha


[20-Mar-25 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
In a perfect and ideal market (which prun isn't), every investment has the same profitability (taking everything into account)
My perspective is that, that profitability equilibrium should be around 15d
And I'm asking if it is outdated (or if, in your opinion, that equilibrium would be lower)


[20-Mar-25 08:09 AM] evov#0000
You can have whatever expectations you want. The market will let you know if others share those expectations I guess.


[20-Mar-25 08:09 AM] zillatron#0000
i agree with that^


[20-Mar-25 08:10 AM] zillatron#0000
there's no one size fits all answer imo


[20-Mar-25 08:10 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah thanks but I want YOUR opinion on that topic


[20-Mar-25 08:11 AM] evov#0000
My opinion... is that your expectations are grounded in an incomplete world view.


[20-Mar-25 08:11 AM] evov#0000
Within the boundary of factors you recognize / consider / understand ..... your expectations might make 100% complete sense.


[20-Mar-25 08:13 AM] zillatron#0000
my opinion: the difference between 15 and 10 days roi on a base is negligible and not really useful beyond the initial expectation of when you can turn a profit on a single base


[20-Mar-25 08:13 AM] zillatron#0000
if you'e running razor thin margins on that base then is it really a good base to begin with?


[20-Mar-25 08:15 AM] zillatron#0000
if people are paying for what you're making then i dont really see what the problem is, seems like thats a unicorn


[20-Mar-25 08:16 AM] zillatron#0000
but i'd need more info to form a proper opinion üòÑ


[20-Mar-25 08:16 AM] jcheung#0000
I meant if 10d is too good, what does 5d get marked as


[20-Mar-25 08:16 AM] zillatron#0000
i dont think saying 1 is good or bad is super useful beyond what i said up there^


[20-Mar-25 08:17 AM] laaxus#0000
Insane, imo


[20-Mar-25 08:17 AM] zillatron#0000
'on what day after i sink 1 million into this base will i make a profit'


[20-Mar-25 08:17 AM] jcheung#0000
There are a lot of things done on triple greens that have 5d returns


[20-Mar-25 08:18 AM] zillatron#0000
ok so...that makes those bases more 'valuable' because 1) they are in limited supply and 2) you can turn a profit faster


[20-Mar-25 08:19 AM] evov#0000
"In a perfect and ideal market (which prun isn't), every investment has the same profitability (taking everything into account)"    - 

Using a real world example - You're presented a choice where you can start a business.

1. Hot dog stand - Costs you 10k, makes you 1k per month.
2. Factory making bolts - Costs you 10mil, makes you 500k per month.

Hot dog stand = faster RoI.
But as a human being - you only have 168 hrs in the week. Which makes the most sense to invest your time/energy into? ....  Kinda depends ... how much capital you have available, how much time you have committed to other endeavors etc etc.

I think it's entirely possible.... that there's just a gap between your view/understanding of the markets, and reality.

Not to throw in a demand-side argument here, but I spend _maybe_ 5k a day on SC across all my bases


[20-Mar-25 08:20 AM] evov#0000
Think of the permit system in game, to be a crude representation of people's time availability in the real world.


[20-Mar-25 08:22 AM] evov#0000
At low permit count - business's that require low capital, but might require intense energy / micromanagment / time investment - make sense.

At high permit count - Its not worth your time to get bogged down in business investments that require you to have a lot of input in the day-to-day operation.


[20-Mar-25 08:22 AM] laaxus#0000
No, I took all of this into account, but if I had to go in such details, I wouldn't have been able to fit it into 2 lines (hence why I wrote "taking everything into account" (aka access to capital, how much time you have, your body health, your knowledge and experience etc etc tho in prun it's more simplified)


[20-Mar-25 08:24 AM] sidepipe#0000
this is why I don't like to look at just ROI as a metric. Investing 1M in a base with an 8 day ROI isn't really that useful if you have 100M sitting around in your bank account. I think at some point, there's just a limitation in the game of where you can profitably deploy all that capital

Relevance to your SC example - As people's permit count's grow - they don't give a shit what the cost of SC is because it has such a minor impact on the overall profitability of their empire.


[20-Mar-25 08:25 AM] zillatron#0000
...and if your base turns a profit in 5 days or 10 days it doesnt materially impact anything apart from which day you get to start counting profit

anyway I'm supposed to work so I don't have the time to debate much longer


[20-Mar-25 08:26 AM] evov#0000
SC is also - a pain in the ass to produce vertically due to how low the demand volume is. You going to set up a base to extract TAI? ASM's to convert it to TA? Ship that heavy stuff around.... all to produce... how much per week?


[20-Mar-25 08:27 AM] zillatron#0000

i guess i dont see it as a big enough issue to be concerned if someone else is making a base that has an ROI of 5 days or 10 or 20. Thats an issue for their profitability


[20-Mar-25 08:29 AM] zillatron#0000
more people in ANT space with profitable bases is a good thing right? so why put an arbitary time frame on when they're allowed to make a profit? seems counter intuitive


[20-Mar-25 08:31 AM] zillatron#0000
anyway my orignal question was about what was wrong with the price of SC haha


[20-Mar-25 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000
I just believe that 250k profit for a chp base is too high


[20-Mar-25 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000
that was the kick start


[20-Mar-25 08:32 AM] evov#0000
Price of SC was slightly elevated in ANT space. Anyone with a little bit of spare cash and ship can easily go buy some from the other CX's and bring it to ANT.


[20-Mar-25 08:32 AM] zillatron#0000
i dont understand the logic sorry haha


[20-Mar-25 08:33 AM] zillatron#0000
Evo's logic i understand haha


[20-Mar-25 08:33 AM] zillatron#0000
i dont understand how you can say making x profit is bad


[20-Mar-25 08:33 AM] laaxus#0000
because it doesn't maximize welfare


[20-Mar-25 08:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
I generally agree that (everything else being equal) - the profit of a given building doing _anything_ should be similar to anything else it does. But I think the whole vertical integration thing kicks in at some point - like SC requires a lot of stuff that seems like a PITA to source, so it makes sense that it would command a higher price


[20-Mar-25 08:34 AM] sidepipe#0000
at some point, the profits you're seeing don't just pay for the CHP making the SC, they pay for everything else that you have to build to make the SC


[20-Mar-25 08:34 AM] zillatron#0000
welfare doesnt make my line go up


[20-Mar-25 08:34 AM] laaxus#0000
welfare is how much value is created market wise


[20-Mar-25 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
anyway, I really have to go see ya


[20-Mar-25 08:36 AM] evov#0000
One major error in the logic (imo) is the assumption that the high price now = high price for a prolonged period.

Time between putting down a base and producing SC to bring it to market.... how confident are you that the price stays where it is?

This is why I like to look at volume more than price. I think It gives a better indicator of supply /demand issues. I think supply/demand issues are a better prdictor of future price... than current price is.

my line is going up just fine so I must be doing something right not worrying to much about my 10 day ROI bases üòÑ


[20-Mar-25 08:40 AM] evov#0000
I think that's one of the fun parts of the game tbh. Forming your own idea's / theories about the market and testing them out. Better understanding leads to better ideas leads to line go up faster.


[20-Mar-25 08:41 AM] zillatron#0000
:stonks:


[20-Mar-25 08:57 AM] zillatron#0000
Some food for thought for when you have more time: Let's say I put down a base that has a 3 day ROI.  You would say (i think) that this is not good because the ROI is 'too fast' - what this *doesnt* tell you is how much other stuff I've built to get this base running. The ROI on *this base* is 3 days.  

ROI on the other 3 bases to feed it are 7, 5 and 11 days - is it still too fast? My argument is that counting the days to when i can say that particular base as profitable is useful(-ish, to me) but it's an incomplete picture of my actual profitability because the reality is it's at *least* 11 days until the entire supply chain is profitable...not counting production time and shipping to actually feed the base with the 3 day ROI. TL;DR - IMO it's more complicated than the ROI number in prun planner and getting hung up on that number is not super useful to you in the long run. üññ


[20-Mar-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
"The ROI on this base is 3 days." then it just means that market price aren't accurate


[20-Mar-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
last time this happened, I fed the 3d roi base only from the CX, until price adjusted


[20-Mar-25 08:59 AM] laaxus#0000
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


[20-Mar-25 09:34 AM] evov#0000
Either the market is wrong.... or the calculations for RoI differ from other people's.

There's a lot of things that may, or may not be included in the RoI calcs.

What price is being used for the input materials, the in consumes, the repairs?
How will your increased buys or sells of these items impact that price?
Are you including your permit cost?
Are you including the amount of capital tied up in consumes held on base?
Are you including the amount of capital tied up in input materials held on base?
How long do you expect it will take to sell your outputs, how much capital is tied up for how long in those?
How much capital is tied up in the ships required to service this base?
What's the logistics cost per unit for inputs, for outputs?
How do you calculate the loss of income incurred while population fills? While experts are still being generated?


I understand it's common for people to use a set of tools, that show a number with "RoI" next to it. It's possible... that actual cost to establish a base is quite different to the value being used to deliver a "3day RoI"

[20-Mar-25 09:39 AM] laaxus#0000
1) Ask
2) They will change, it's expected
3) yes
4) yes
5) yes
6) while I don't do it, I should try to estimate how long it takes for the material to be sold
7) I'm including shipping cost yes
8) same as 7
9) I assume population fills in one week and experts instantly to 5. Not perfect approximation but good enough


[20-Mar-25 09:39 AM] laaxus#0000
that's how I do it


[20-Mar-25 09:40 AM] laaxus#0000
my roi is not just the number on the prunplanner plan


[20-Mar-25 09:41 AM] evov#0000
Well, if you've considered all the details, and still see a glitch in the matrix, jump on it and get rich.


[20-Mar-25 09:44 AM] laaxus#0000
I've reached the point (HQ 20) where it wouldn't be worth it anymore to do it


[20-Mar-25 09:45 AM] laaxus#0000

I'm looking at dropping an electronics base with a year long ROI after permit


[20-Mar-25 09:46 AM] laaxus#0000
I wished we had access the distribution of active players per hq level


[20-Mar-25 09:46 AM] evov#0000
So, maybe the market prices ARE accurate... and just reflect's the fact that for a lot of people, that 3day RoI base isn't "worth it"


[20-Mar-25 09:46 AM] laaxus#0000
Again, I'm not saying the market IS wrong


[20-Mar-25 09:46 AM] laaxus#0000

Doesn't show how many are active. And this looks like it's bases instead of permits. But should be an indicator at least.

[20-Mar-25 09:51 AM] evov#0000
I would think that a lot of the <5 base players count are inactive.


[20-Mar-25 09:51 AM] laaxus#0000
but yes, if we assume the majority of bases belongs to players with HQ lvl > 20, then that everybase is around 100k profit/d  is not that surprising


[20-Mar-25 09:53 AM] evov#0000
There's lots of things that tilt the scales. Most new players will be doing Agriculture or Smelting, so those industries are almost always less profitable. A lot of extraction bases will require more ships... so despite cheap bases... also not suitable for low capital players.


[20-Mar-25 09:55 AM] evov#0000
Bases that require higher tier work forces usually cost a lot more to build, which also tends to exclude low capital players. 

Its part of why there's always a constant tension between roi and $/area.


[20-Mar-25 10:08 AM] vanarazor#0000
I believe so,


[20-Mar-25 10:39 AM] marat_sh#0000
Isn‚Äôt that stat wrong? There was a website that counted player bases even if you remove it and build another one. It only added build bases but not subtracting remove bases

Good luck sourcing that much continuous TA and not crashing the SC market


[20-Mar-25 01:15 PM] finestone#0000
in your world TA would be priced at 32k


[20-Mar-25 01:17 PM] finestone#0000
the problem is not that SC price is incorrect its simply the input good is annoying and the difference between 18-22k TA is very fine line.


[20-Mar-25 01:17 PM] laaxus#0000
Then maybe it's the current TA price that is under valued


[20-Mar-25 01:19 PM] finestone#0000

It‚Äôs got my info right


[21-Mar-25 05:08 AM] zillatron#0000
the example im using is a MM product so the sale price is fixed (i did that deliberately because the sale price is fixed) - the ROI number for *that* base is making a lot of assumptions. 

Anyway the point im trying to make is that looking at that 1 number is not a good guide to *real profitability* - it's a guide at best and saying a particular number is good or bad is not super useful in the scheme of things.


[22-Mar-25 11:55 PM] vanarazor#0000

[23-Mar-25 11:12 AM] tanda#0000
Give it a little minute before you try to correct this, but I wouldn't try to run INC on Deimos


[23-Mar-25 11:13 AM] tanda#0000
A good rule of thumb I use when I design ~~planets~~bases is to have no more than two industries on that planet, and no more than one off COGC


[23-Mar-25 11:13 AM] tanda#0000
the COGC for Deimos is metallurgy, so that's your smelters. Given the volumes of ore you go through, I would suggest Extractors after that.


[23-Mar-25 11:14 AM] tanda#0000
Save INC and Agri production for your second and third planets


[23-Mar-25 11:15 AM] tanda#0000
otherwise your experts get split and everything just takes forever, takes up too much space and is too expensive


[23-Mar-25 11:15 AM] tanda#0000
in many cases it's actually cheaper to buy, because it's harder to count in things like opportunity costs

One thing I am struggling with is I am looking at the market supply/demand and volume traded for most of the products and it looks like the supply outweighs the demand and the volume is quite low, how does anyone actually trade large quantities of items?


[23-Mar-25 09:12 PM] tanda#0000
I've been known to spend millions across every CX to get the cheap items I need


[23-Mar-25 09:12 PM] tanda#0000
I know others do similar


[23-Mar-25 09:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
On Deimos AL is like the defacto choice for everyone


[23-Mar-25 09:18 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But STL and FE can do well as well


[23-Mar-25 09:21 PM] vzealousv#0000
and when you sell any of these items are you selling at the ask price or the bid price


[23-Mar-25 09:21 PM] vzealousv#0000
or somewhere in the middle


[23-Mar-25 09:50 PM] vzealousv#0000
Okay I was using the "traded" stat and that doesn't seem to reflect the actual traded volume


[24-Mar-25 03:29 AM] pxlfox.#0000
AL is definitely oversupplies atm and prices are really cheap. AL is always in high demand, especially for pfabs and ship parts. But we lost a big player producing ships, so I guess market is currently saturated. Nonetheless, AL is a very good and stable market. Just not giving much profit atm.


[24-Mar-25 03:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
FE and STL are currently good choices, tho everything else then AL is getting heavy and harder to ship


[24-Mar-25 03:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
CU is stagnating, AU has a little demand spike, but probably nothing sustainable


[24-Mar-25 03:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
depends on the market, my strategy, my pricing model and if I need cash now or if I can wait.


[24-Mar-25 03:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
basically, if you can wait for the cash, put it at ask and let it sit. If you need the money now, sell at bid.


[24-Mar-25 03:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
check if the prices are reasonable and profitable for you first


[24-Mar-25 03:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
supply/demand is a difficult metric to read and not something I was able to really use for my advantage. I mostly use it as an indicator. Markets adjust really slowly in this game.


[24-Mar-25 10:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I‚Äôm official petitioning to make IA-151b to the official IDC planet of ANT space.

As discussed in the ADI discord, IDC is produced, no matter if you like it or not. Even tho they don‚Äôt interact much with the market, they still generate revenue for the region (consumables and repair materials).
Most of the IDC is not produced in ANT space, even tho we have probably a lot of Antareans producing those.
So an official, high SCI planet in ANT space capable to support the antarean IDC bases is just logical, to support the region and siphone off some of that IDC money into AI1.

[24-Mar-25 09:32 PM] evov#0000
If you want a pure IDC base - Phobos -> Malahat -> Jeetiyu.

Of the 4 Electronics planets I govern in the ANT region -  ( LS-014a, LS-014b, IA-151b, IA-158e )  - 158e is the only one that has sci on it / the pop inf required to support them.

If someone put down a 400sci base on any of those planets ... it's taking somewhere between 10 and 16 weeks to fill the pop.

If people really want more IDC capable planets, I'm happy to work through a solution.... but it'll be longer and slower than anyone wants. It would start with requiring mixed bases from people, to grow the tech/eng pop as well. Eng/Sci don't get ANY passive immigration... only programs  (sci is 25 per week, eng is 50 per week ) or education movement ..... which will be very very minor if the previous pop tier is small.

In the long run (after HQ 10 latest) you should calculate Profit per Permit, because with higher HQ the cost for upgrades goes up. After HQ 20 -> 21 = ~6-7 Mio Credit!


[25-Mar-25 02:58 AM] magican1980#0000
atm I'm at 18 Permits, with a profit about 1.3 Mio daily ~72k Profit per Permit


[25-Mar-25 03:04 AM] magican1980#0000
My products (selling) are Carbon and Rat, with own H2O and NS Input for HYF


[25-Mar-25 04:36 AM] evov#0000
I would say 20 permits is the breakpoint where $/permit becomes more important than RoI. Up to 20 permits - do the closest thing you can to unrestricted growth. 20 -> 30 refine your choices with $/Area in mind. 30+ start ripping down old low $/Area bases as needed.


[25-Mar-25 05:50 AM] magican1980#0000
In the end it comes to how much liquid cash you have, before you must sell. atm I'm lucky with the prices for RAT (mostly 160+, without market cap I predict 200+ possible) and my Carbon production expanded at a time, where the prices where at 750-850 Credits, but now it has saturated mostly the demand for productions. Many Buy-Orders at CX Benten and Antares are Traders. I expect a steady price at 700 Credit or between 650-700 credits in the next 2-3 months.


[25-Mar-25 06:00 AM] magican1980#0000
and yes, I looking for optimisation in my production chains üôÇ on the other side, I had luck for my own Inputs H2O for the hungry HYF and now NS, because market didnt deliver enough at a steady price. HQ 20-30 about ~200-210 Mio Credits and so I need to accumulate cash and ships for the next expansions üôÇ

kkeeps to much capital on the CX


[25-Mar-25 12:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
yeah - I've put out some bids before, but it seems like you have to either choose a) a price not much lower than the ask so it gets filled right away or b) a lower price that gets frontrun a lot and that you'll need to refresh a few times to get filled


[25-Mar-25 12:47 PM] sidepipe#0000
since cash is less of an issue for me, I just buy things at ask to save time


[25-Mar-25 12:47 PM] laaxus#0000
How is not selling into bids, not holding your capital up


[25-Mar-25 12:51 PM] realharvey#0000
it holds my capital up and increases my revenue by 5-30%. I am okay with that since I need to save up capital for 2-3 Weeks to upgrade my HQ

[25-Mar-25 04:44 PM] jab.sh#0000
huh, I have the issue too (on firefox)


[25-Mar-25 04:51 PM] razenpok#0000
Oh wait, it's actually a rprun bug


[25-Mar-25 04:51 PM] razenpok#0000
But from a different feature


[25-Mar-25 04:51 PM] razenpok#0000
It's caused by `table-rows-alternating-colors`


[25-Mar-25 04:56 PM] jab.sh#0000
I was wondering if it was related to the alternating colors (also didn't realize that was an rprun feature)


[25-Mar-25 05:00 PM] razenpok#0000
I'll add a fix in the next version


[25-Mar-25 05:00 PM] razenpok#0000
Weird though, it only reproduces on firefox

[25-Mar-25 11:13 PM] vanarazor#0000
how do you build up the tech and eng population ?


[25-Mar-25 11:16 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can run programs or build up the population and supply population infrastructure


[25-Mar-25 11:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Which you would need to talk to the gov about


[25-Mar-25 11:17 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So like you could do it but like aceland is already built up with a lot of the POPI to support Eng so that might be better


[25-Mar-25 11:19 PM] .urpalhal#0000
If you do put a base down on Nike jr with those pops I would reach out before hand

[26-Mar-25 06:56 AM] laaxus#0000
but consumption is still higher than production

so situation has not been solved


[26-Mar-25 08:19 AM] pagy1234#0000
just an idea to throw out there, would it not be pretty profitable to have a few ships just costantly move good from one CX to another?

unless you have gigantic capital, you'll try to buy at ask, and sell at bid in another cx

bleh, i have already been experimenting with some CX gambling, basically whenever im bored im open up `XIT MATS` and browse through all the CXM to find where there are undersupplied markets, and il buy out some amount of stock and sell it at a higher price


[26-Mar-25 08:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
its not super lucrative but does work slowly


[26-Mar-25 08:22 AM] laaxus#0000
just not worth the capital investment if you ask me


[26-Mar-25 08:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
I have made about 1.1 mil total on maybe a 1mil investment across everythign I have done


[26-Mar-25 08:23 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah probably correct but its free money when im saving up for something and my money is idle


[26-Mar-25 08:24 AM] laaxus#0000
for that, I rather like to just put bids


[26-Mar-25 08:24 AM] laaxus#0000

[26-Mar-25 08:26 AM] pagy1234#0000
would you then resell that quickly?


[26-Mar-25 08:26 AM] laaxus#0000
no, I just put bids for the input good I need


[26-Mar-25 08:26 AM] laaxus#0000
I usually buy at ask


[26-Mar-25 08:27 AM] laaxus#0000
so when I have capital idling


[26-Mar-25 08:27 AM] laaxus#0000
I put bid for input good I need


[26-Mar-25 08:27 AM] laaxus#0000
at a price lower than ask, but above the highest bid, at a price I consider reasonable

[26-Mar-25 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
either that or we're suffering a huge inflation spike


[26-Mar-25 08:38 AM] evov#0000
When prices are too low for too long, people stop making the stuff. Market slowly eats through the stockpile. Dummies think they're doing the "right" thing by continuing to sell short supply items cheaply. This prevents or delays the signal (increased price) for people to consider producing more. Then you run into a problem far worse than inflated prices - supply availability.

[26-Mar-25 08:51 AM] zillatron#0000
I'm pretty sure GL has been in a supply deficit for longer than this week, someone ate 5000 like 2 weeks ago so its gonna take a bit to rebalance


[26-Mar-25 08:55 AM] evov#0000
Universe wide - GL supply is fine and price is a bit low imo. I think it's just local ANT supply that's short.


[26-Mar-25 08:59 AM] zillatron#0000
yeh i dont sell much to the CX so i'm not really across it, prunplanner's market history seems to tell more or less the same story

[27-Mar-25 11:17 AM] laaxus#0000
You can't go wrong with a FP base on norwick


[27-Mar-25 11:18 AM] laaxus#0000
you also could build a CHP base on griffonstone


[27-Mar-25 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
you could also build an POL base


[27-Mar-25 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
the HAL -> CL -> EPO chain is very lucrative and as safe as it gets


[27-Mar-25 11:19 AM] laaxus#0000
you could also build another FRM base on demeter


[27-Mar-25 11:20 AM] tarrant1113#0000
Lol so many options


[27-Mar-25 11:21 AM] laaxus#0000
You could also build half a PP2 base on either norwick or aceland


[27-Mar-25 11:21 AM] laaxus#0000
they're all viable option, I don't really want to tell you how to play


[27-Mar-25 11:22 AM] laaxus#0000
create a base on prunplanner for each possibility, weight the pro and cons and chose !


[27-Mar-25 11:22 AM] tarrant1113#0000
I was initally thing FIM, but I think id need 2 HER bases to properly supply


[27-Mar-25 11:22 AM] tarrant1113#0000
based on planner


[27-Mar-25 11:22 AM] laaxus#0000
you don't need to be entirely safe reliant


[27-Mar-25 11:22 AM] laaxus#0000
it's ok to buy input goods from the cx


[27-Mar-25 11:23 AM] laaxus#0000
you could buy HER from the cx in the meantime


[27-Mar-25 11:23 AM] laaxus#0000
you could produce something else in parallel if you prefer (like dw or rats)


[27-Mar-25 11:23 AM] laaxus#0000
if prunplanner tells you it's profitable, you aren't losing money by buying goods on the cx !


[27-Mar-25 11:24 AM] tarrant1113#0000
haha fair


[27-Mar-25 11:24 AM] laaxus#0000
most player really try  to integrate vertically as much as possible


[27-Mar-25 11:24 AM] tarrant1113#0000
same


[27-Mar-25 11:25 AM] laaxus#0000
but if everybody was entirely vertical, there would be no sales


[27-Mar-25 11:25 AM] laaxus#0000
no market


[27-Mar-25 11:25 AM] laaxus#0000
there's really no fear to have by relying on the cx


[27-Mar-25 11:25 AM] laaxus#0000
in fact, that's how I made a shit ton of money early on


[27-Mar-25 11:26 AM] laaxus#0000
RAT sellers had mostly integrated supply chains


[27-Mar-25 11:26 AM] laaxus#0000
RAT price was high


[27-Mar-25 11:26 AM] laaxus#0000
but input goods price were low


[27-Mar-25 11:26 AM] laaxus#0000
meaning that, by buying the input goods on the cx, I made a shit ton of money, much more than the other producers that vertically integrated


[27-Mar-25 11:54 PM] evany.#0000
i would actually highly encourage you not to vertically integrate at all at least your first 3-5 bases


[27-Mar-25 11:55 PM] evany.#0000
it can be much harder/longer turn around to 'realize' any gains the further your vertically integrated


[28-Mar-25 12:00 AM] evany.#0000
when you have ten bases and pulling 1mil a week that might matter a lot less , but when you still are kinda scraping by trying to expand you might not have three weeks for your longer production chain to sell out 

you *could* mine ALO and turn it into AL then turn it in to BFAB then turn it into RFAB and sell it for a profit

RFAB sold 140 units today at about 15% margin
AL sold 4000+ units at 11% margin

just one example obviously


[28-Mar-25 12:02 AM] getonthetrain#0000
My thinking is if it is commonly available item like AL, then no worries about availability and price


[28-Mar-25 12:04 AM] getonthetrain#0000
some people just like to mass produce that stuff

I had my first starting base at Katao with FRM (Bonus Manufacturing) and had a build from tutorial a rig, FRM and INC for Carbon (yes I have gone the route Carbon). I think the vertically integration depens on what product you make - I had stable Profit with 3 Permit Base with FRM/INC. Later I found out about COGH (after 3-4 Months into the game) and go to a new agri planet and build a second base like the first. 
From my *personal *feeling at that time, found that to produce Carbon, to buy the inputs, was not profitable, so I have produced myself on one Planet. H2O come from CX.  At that time I had no understanding in calculate the profit per Permit, use Buy-/Sell-orders, options for Loans or grants, how to upgrade ships, how to use contracts and so on.  

But every Person has their own way and experience on the way to the first own money for expansion :). After about 14 month into the game, the most changes came after getting the starting ships to WCB, change my Carbon to HYF/INC-Bases and also at the H2O price spike (from 20->30-40 credits) a H2O Base.


[28-Mar-25 05:18 AM] magican1980#0000
If I expand to a third Carbon HYF-INC-Base I would crash the market-prices down. atm the Buy-Orders at Benten and Antares are many times filled with Orders from Trader and not users of Carbon in their own productions.

It‚Äôs really easy to overproduce for a lot of markets.

I know this problem. at one time I have changed my old Katoa base to BMP -> produce MCG all time and sold it at Benten and Antares - the prices dropped down under 30-25 credits. After that I stripped the base and now the prices have complete recover and higher üôÇ

Is there really a demand for an ADI ship project? EvoV has ships on demand, OOG has a little bit cheaper ships, other regions sell ships, too.


[28-Mar-25 06:00 AM] laaxus#0000
EvoV has a "expensive but always on stock" model
Rise had a "cheaper but with a waiting queue" model


[28-Mar-25 06:00 AM] zillatron#0000
(as a fellow metallurgist) this is the way (at least for a good while anyway)


[28-Mar-25 06:00 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't want to compete with EvoV, but cheaper with waiting queue seems more doable


[28-Mar-25 06:01 AM] zillatron#0000
if you're making ships, you're competing with other shipbuilders...its kinda unavoidable


[28-Mar-25 06:03 AM] magican1980#0000
RiseofFlith was at 4.4 Mio for a LCB without Hull Plates and Fuel - OOG at 5.95 Mio | EvoV at 6.2 Mio - but both with Fuel | GTU at Moria is at about 5.5 Mio without fuel


[28-Mar-25 06:03 AM] magican1980#0000
very affordable for new players


[28-Mar-25 06:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
To make them cheaper, we would need people to abstain from profits they would get by selling stuff on the market


[28-Mar-25 06:04 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And balance production to demand


[28-Mar-25 06:04 AM] zillatron#0000
it seems impossible when you first start but once you're rolling Evo's ships aren't 'expensive' imo


[28-Mar-25 06:04 AM] magican1980#0000
Highlander Shipbuilding ist atm delivery at may 25 ... a long waiting line, but the cheapest price

@pxlfox. I supplied Rise a bit of stuff too, not a fixed supplier possibly the way you were but I've scaled down and repurposed a couple of bases to adjust so it's deff possible üëç

I only had one base for him making CUO - he took about half of the production and I made some CU on the side. It‚Äôs not too bad, just need to get the CUO to the people. But nothing, that a bit of time and the right price can‚Äôt solve üòâ

yes with the upgraded ship you can handle up to 5-6 permits of bases, but it also depends on the design / products of the bases


[28-Mar-25 06:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Then again, would an ADI project make ships that much cheaper? ü§î


[28-Mar-25 06:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I‚Äôm pretty sure EvoV‚Äôs prices can be taken as ‚Äúwhat it takes to make ships with as much CX-Outsourcing as possible‚Äù


[28-Mar-25 06:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
An ADI ship project would be a great and fun cooperative endeavour. It would be like a car manufacturing firm in the real world. Lots of suppliers, which all need to be organised. We need a competitive pricing scheme, that makes contribution attractive, but prices as low as possible


[28-Mar-25 06:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And it would benefit the region. Ships are the resource sinks of this universe. And cheaper ships lead to faster growth


[28-Mar-25 06:21 AM] magican1980#0000
thats I can only agree on. If have I have seen correctly the GTU has players to produce the needed components and selling at a fixed price in their chart


[28-Mar-25 06:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Something like ‚Äúfirst ship for ADI members discount‚Äù could help early- and mid-game players progress fast, making ADI overall more attractive to players


[28-Mar-25 06:23 AM] magican1980#0000
is there not a Project ship kit ? in this discord?


[28-Mar-25 06:23 AM] pxlfox.#0000

I know this üôÇ In the last 2-3 months I have expanded to Antares with 1 Carbon and 1 Rat-Line (HYF+INC or FD), with 1 steady Loan. At that time I was thinking after 1 week I have the complete setup and production, but it took about 2-3 week for the first profits to roll in. I was lucky with my production lines at CX Benten. Now I'm expanded at Hortus with 1 DW-Line and 1 Rations-Line. Though my vertical integration of H2O and NS I hope to step up to 6-8 Mio Profit weekly.

[28-Mar-25 06:56 AM] evov#0000
I actually do very limited CX outsourcing past the metal smelting stage. The number of smelting / ore extraction bases I'd need just made this step non-viable.

While I probably could outsource a lot more now... when I started making ships and setting up my production lines, there simply wasn't the volume of materials needed on the CX. This is easily verifiable by working down the production chart for all the ship parts and checking the leader boards to see if I'm producing it at all.


[28-Mar-25 06:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Soo, your production is already mostly vertically integrated?


[28-Mar-25 07:00 AM] evov#0000
Very much. Yes. I'll have shortages from time to time and try to lean on the market to top up. But I'd say 90%+ of the ship is made myself. ( excluding raw materials extraction / smelting ).


[28-Mar-25 07:05 AM] evov#0000
Something I think people don't really understand about selling complete ships.... it's a service, not a money making endeavor. I make a lot more $ per ship selling the parts on the CX.

For example - the new HCB ships I've been selling for 11mil.  - I can (and do) sell the parts independently on the CX... when done so it totals closer to 17mil.

LCB - I sell for 6.2mil, but make about 7mil on the CX.
3k1k heavies - I sell for 5.8mil, 6.5mil on the CX.
1k3k Gashaulers - I sell for 6.8mil, 8.3mil on the CX.

So from an economic perspective, I should restrict the number of ships I sell, and just push the parts on the CX. But not all choices are driven purely by economics.


[28-Mar-25 07:37 AM] magican1980#0000
good to know üôÇ


[28-Mar-25 07:38 AM] magican1980#0000
In my personal view, the ship builders intentions are to supply ships, so that the economy can grown and second personal profits.

[28-Mar-25 11:31 PM] vanarazor#0000
is there a tool I can use that scan the markets and tells me the most voluminous mats bought lately?


[28-Mar-25 11:33 PM] vanarazor#0000
for example I have a manufacturing planet, I produce some PSL on it 9/d, it is consistent and I would not want to expand that production since the daily sales volume is fairly low


[28-Mar-25 11:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Well PSL used to be a lot cheaper


[28-Mar-25 11:34 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like 3-4k range


[28-Mar-25 11:34 PM] vanarazor#0000
but I'd like to find something that is in constant high sales volume with not many producers that I can invest into ( which means in my purchasing powwe)


[28-Mar-25 11:35 PM] vanarazor#0000
seeing the price of IND for example tells me that a lot of people are buying it constantly


[28-Mar-25 11:35 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Good luck.
I don‚Äôt know of any tools, but I run off vibes so

[28-Mar-25 11:35 PM] vanarazor#0000
SC has high return but it does not look like it has high volume


[28-Mar-25 11:36 PM] vanarazor#0000
but actually iIND sales are inexsistant


[28-Mar-25 11:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yup I was gonna say


[28-Mar-25 11:36 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Idk what IND even is


[28-Mar-25 11:36 PM] vanarazor#0000
which means people are vertically integrating it


[28-Mar-25 11:37 PM] vanarazor#0000
a mats of HSS HMS LC


[28-Mar-25 11:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Ah


[28-Mar-25 11:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah so those are like high end pop ‚Äúfood‚Äù


[28-Mar-25 11:37 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So they have use, but not tons of use


[28-Mar-25 11:37 PM] vanarazor#0000
I mean HMS is only technician tier


[28-Mar-25 11:38 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah like SC


[28-Mar-25 11:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
I‚Äôd still wager that TEC is high end


[28-Mar-25 11:38 PM] vanarazor#0000
SC is the higher tier PWO


[28-Mar-25 11:38 PM] vanarazor#0000
fair enough


[28-Mar-25 11:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Most people have bases with just PIO and SET so


[28-Mar-25 11:38 PM] .urpalhal#0000
But that being said


[28-Mar-25 11:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
They *are* consumables


[28-Mar-25 11:39 PM] .urpalhal#0000
So the need isn‚Äôt ever not going to be there


[28-Mar-25 11:39 PM] vanarazor#0000
im trying to take in consideration volume of daily sales, it feels like the game invites you/ or the market if you want invites you to diversify your production and matching the daily sales volume


[28-Mar-25 11:40 PM] vanarazor#0000
in that regardws it is easy to misinterpret PRplan ROI value


[28-Mar-25 11:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Yeah ROI is a good indicator what what *coudl* be a good product but not the tell all


[28-Mar-25 11:41 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like if you make millions but never sell you don‚Äôt really have millions


[28-Mar-25 11:41 PM] vanarazor#0000
when I started producing consumables I produced a lot of PWO for example but it looked like the price was too low so I stop, but PWO is being bought daily


[28-Mar-25 11:42 PM] vanarazor#0000
ROI here tells what is worth procuing if you are buying mats from the market


[28-Mar-25 11:43 PM] vanarazor#0000
but if you are vertically integrating the value is completely different


[28-Mar-25 11:43 PM] vanarazor#0000
but I think prplan is taking vertical intergation in consideration in the Empire tab


[28-Mar-25 11:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
That‚Äôs hard to say


[28-Mar-25 11:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Bc just cause you make it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs free


[28-Mar-25 11:44 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The value of the product is just shifted


[28-Mar-25 11:45 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah but for example,  if you are producing enough consumables for your own production then what is the real cost of an extracting base then ? ?


[28-Mar-25 11:45 PM] .urpalhal#0000
The opportunity cost


[28-Mar-25 11:45 PM] vanarazor#0000

[29-Mar-25 06:20 PM] evov#0000
I think most Gov's will use spreadsheets or tools to help govern a planet.
Planetary Gov's have their own balance sheet. Taxes / Fee's automatically go into them.
Programs, like immigration, are paid for directly out of the planetary gov balance sheet.
Things that require items - building new infrastructure, upkeep on that infrastructure, cogc upkeep etc - typically the  governor buys/supplies this stuff and the planet admin pays them back.

not necessarily, different infrastructure to make KOM vs FIM/MEA

I is another one :  Volume are in the lows,  Requests are way greater than than Offers,  yet it is not worth processing . Means price or CLI is too high compared to prices of I.

Am I right to think that VG consumers have integrated their CLI > I >VIT>VG prod??

Unless I'm missing something - Take a balanced set of consumes. Package them up by spending resources ( PSS ) + Permit space on a manufacturing planet to build Packaging Center's. And the net benefit is load compression. Maybe it's more appealing for people to buy the packs rather than buy the individual items, so there's likely a convenience benefit there.

With respect to compression - All of my bases I resupply at 60 day intervals. I can put 60 days worth of repairs + consumes into a single 2k2k ship. So for me and how I operate, it saves zero shipping capacity, while adding shipping requirements to ship consumes from the cx to the manufacturing planet, then ship packages back to the cx.

It will be interesting to see the feedback on it.

biggest issue I have with it is that you cant just put 1 or 2 down in the corner of a base and have it be enough, to be enough to cover my production of DW, I would need 10+


[31-Mar-25 04:26 AM] laaxus#0000

You can finally send consumables to planets without a thousand micro-contracts - sounds like a win to me


[31-Mar-25 04:28 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats not where I would think the cost would come from, I dont believe there are too many people actually making all of the consumables included in a bundle, and if someone is, spending an entire permit on packing all the consumables seems quite illogical


[31-Mar-25 04:29 AM] laaxus#0000
depends on the production rate

at least the POP usage of the packing center is kinda low


[31-Mar-25 04:33 AM] evov#0000
So, the question I have... is what sort of premium are people willing to pay for the convenience factor? +5%? 10% 20% etc. How much more would you pay for your consumables if you could get them in this form?

[31-Mar-25 04:34 AM] laaxus#0000
Assuming 100k profit per day, and a very rough estimation of 70 PBU produced per day for a full 500 area base, it would mean 1.5k of overprice per package or roughly 0.75k per day (for a base like FRM)


[31-Mar-25 04:35 AM] laaxus#0000
it's probably more around 80 production per day


[31-Mar-25 04:36 AM] laaxus#0000
so yeah, I think it will be profitable and popular


[31-Mar-25 04:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
my math tells me its about 50 per day?


[31-Mar-25 04:40 AM] laaxus#0000
multiply by 1.618

ah for lux and experts


[31-Mar-25 04:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
kk


[31-Mar-25 04:43 AM] laaxus#0000
My opinion is that the playerbase would be ready to do things manually even if it earns them 1k per day per base


[31-Mar-25 04:43 AM] laaxus#0000
but I think the producers would prefer to sell the packaged item, rather than the different item, seperately


[31-Mar-25 04:44 AM] pagy1234#0000
alr, yeah actually profit doesnt look terrible, if aiming for 100k/d profit then upcharge will be 1.2k per package, assuming cost is about 16.5k to make each one.


[31-Mar-25 04:44 AM] laaxus#0000
such that, later on, the packaged item would be cheaper than buying every single material individually


[31-Mar-25 04:46 AM] pagy1234#0000
although I would think that a producer having the freedom to make only the profitable consumables, rather than being restricted to what the package limits them too would be a factor in limiting how low the price of packages go


[31-Mar-25 04:48 AM] potaterror#0000
I would love that as a facility to be rented at stations.


[31-Mar-25 04:49 AM] laaxus#0000
selling packages on LM now is viable


[31-Mar-25 04:49 AM] potaterror#0000
I guess. I just thinking moving shiploads of finished goods from a base to another base to package them up is kind of missing the point.

[31-Mar-25 04:50 AM] laaxus#0000
the value it creates is outside of the game


[31-Mar-25 04:50 AM] laaxus#0000
which, imo, is not great


[31-Mar-25 04:51 AM] pagy1234#0000
not really for producers though, some portion of that 1.2k profit per package is aready gone from extra ship movements


[31-Mar-25 04:52 AM] pagy1234#0000
and as I mentioned earlier, it also limits what the producers can produce


[31-Mar-25 04:52 AM] potaterror#0000
Well, that's what I'm saying: having to move stuff between bases to package it up largely removes that. Instead of loading up specified quantities and shipping off to a base to resupply directly, you're now just doing multiple shipments of bigger chunks of individual package components, then shipping the finished packages back to a station (probably), and then throwing those out to the end supply points.


[31-Mar-25 04:53 AM] potaterror#0000
That doesn't seem like a worthwhile decrease in effort.


[31-Mar-25 04:54 AM] potaterror#0000
Allowing players to rent packaging facilities on stations and just package up stuff at the place they're dumping everything anyway, on the other hand, might just.

You are thinking in terms of "I package goods for myself", while the benefit is in "Someone sells the packages on the market, and I just buy them instead of buying all goods separately"

I just don't see that being especially alluring with the markup of shipping the component goods to the packaging base, workforce cost to package, then the packaged goods back, and adding a profit margin on top of it. Especially given that a whole lot of people are producing a smattering of consumables themselves, just not the whole spread for any population.

Well, I'll definitely play a wait and see on these PACs. Workforce consumables are pretty minimal shipping, so more power to anyone who finds their niche here. But margins on selling this stuff is going to be tight-tight

The bundle is going to be a decent bit more expensive than the consumables are seperately


[31-Mar-25 11:32 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I get, that they intend to implement it as quick as possible. Therefore they need to use existing programming. 
Having to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù the packages feels logical and in line with the overall game design. 

But yeah, it creates a lot of variables, which decide if the packages will be used or not.

Obviously, the need to dedicate a precious permit, pay for the base, workers and shipping, ads a lot of friction and therefore will make the packages overall more expensive then buying the materials individually.


[31-Mar-25 11:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It will most likely have there niches and use cases. But as many already mentioned, we will need to see, if they will be produced and used more widely

What's kinda rough is that using the bundles is worse than an action package in every way too...
More expensive, more space, and you have to manually unpack anyways once they get to the destination, so more time in game

The issue with actions is that it scales badly the more bases you have. You still have to go 1 by 1. Which isn't too bad if you're well staggered.

I decided to have my custom burn sheet generate me a buy list that merges everything that I need together and it also generates a shipping list per bases that I can execute after I'm done buying the materials with identified blockers that makes each task require another one (or multiple) to be completed before being started.

So far I've had to put a very similar amount of effort even although I just doubled my base count. And whenever I do something multiple times, then I write it down and start thinking of how I can automate that decision making.

Like my next note is to create a shipping route system that makes use of my other data to tell me which ships I should use, when and where.

Whoever wants a copy of my sheet can just dm me and I'll give a copy that doesn't have my API keys.

But I think we can agree, that we generally accept grants not specifically because of their profitability, but because they are overall good designs.


[31-Mar-25 02:00 PM] pxlfox.#0000
We check, if the planet makes sense, if the COGC is fitting, if it‚Äôs logistically feasible, if the material can be sold.


[31-Mar-25 02:01 PM] pxlfox.#0000
And people would still need to open up new threads to apply, so we can still inform them, if a plan isn‚Äôt profitable anymore. But they could already have informed themselves about what‚Äôs  important and needs to be checked first. Like a FAQ

thats actually a good point, while i think theres obvious stuff like cogc but someone more familiar with SME might catch beginner mistakes like FLX / alternate recipes

I need to learn xit action and xit repair
Bundles are a miss
My mea needs to be set very high price so mo market manipulators would buy them


[31-Mar-25 04:59 PM] sidepipe#0000
honestly, just price your MEA at a level you feel comfortable selling at. if someone does buy them all trying to raise the price, then you just get to sell them all at once üòÑ

all i mean is - don't worry too much about raising the price to avoid market manipulation. if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen. and if you're happy selling MEA at 3k (made up number), then you win if someone buys it to resell. maybe they think they can sell at 4k, but who knows? it's money in your pocket and out of their pocket

buildings and ships should be repair at 80 % mark , correct?


[31-Mar-25 09:51 PM] .shiva.#0000
ships yes, buildings are more complicated, but in general every 60 or every 90 days


[31-Mar-25 11:05 PM] jab.sh#0000
buildings 90 days (that's what we do in AA)

[31-Mar-25 11:10 PM] .shiva.#0000
^ the actual details


[31-Mar-25 11:10 PM] .shiva.#0000
it basically boils down to 60/90 days though


[31-Mar-25 11:12 PM] .shiva.#0000
with 60 usually being "optimal" and 90 being very close to as good, but you get an extra month between repairs


[31-Mar-25 11:13 PM] jab.sh#0000
what's the cost difference of 60x3 vs 90x2


[31-Mar-25 11:19 PM] .shiva.#0000
you'd need to do the math for your own base


[31-Mar-25 11:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
for my SME base on deimos


[31-Mar-25 11:22 PM] vanarazor#0000
THQNK YOU


[31-Mar-25 11:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
15k per SME vs 22k per SME


[31-Mar-25 11:22 PM] .urpalhal#0000
so like 60k per SME vs 44k per SME it looks like?


[31-Mar-25 11:25 PM] jab.sh#0000
so 90x2 is cheaper?


[31-Mar-25 11:32 PM] .shiva.#0000
it's not that simple since you're also losing output over time with the longer cycles


[31-Mar-25 11:32 PM] .shiva.#0000
to get the "real" number you need to use the sheet and do the math


[31-Mar-25 11:32 PM] .shiva.#0000
or just pick one of the cycles and stick w/ it


[31-Mar-25 11:32 PM] .shiva.#0000
since it's not *that* different


[31-Mar-25 11:34 PM] laaxus#0000
I repair bases at 45%


[31-Mar-25 11:53 PM] .urpalhal#0000
yeah it also depends


[31-Mar-25 11:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
lol it says I should repair Halcyon every 11 days


[31-Mar-25 11:59 PM] .urpalhal#0000
bc that is the most optimal


[01-Apr-25 03:37 AM] evov#0000
45/60/90 - One of these will most likely be optimal. A lot of it depends on your shipping availability / ratio of repair cost to productivity of the base. A lot of the time I find people do not take into consideration the lost productivity of a base.


[01-Apr-25 03:44 AM] vanarazor#0000
to use the spread shit, and find the daily profit of a building I'm guessing I  should add the profit of each products ?


[01-Apr-25 03:44 AM] vanarazor#0000
and I should find something quite similar to prplanner ?:

I remember one forum post recommending repairing every 45 days

as a good rule of thumb

I repair after 60 days combined with my consumable restock, so I can handle it in one shipment


[01-Apr-25 02:28 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm planing on generating an Antares economic report and would like to know, that metrics would be intersting to you guys.

Atm, I was thinking about population costs (cost per worker per day by type over time), since I feel like that's kinda a metric for overall inflation. 
Also about market saturation and rising/declining markets in price.

Also, what timeframe makes the most sense? Weekly or monthly?

bases per planets?


[01-Apr-25 02:53 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm not sure, if we have that data via FIO


[01-Apr-25 03:08 PM] evany.#0000
i believe someone in the AA might have done something about 'bases' per player, though the numbers slightly different bases per planet..


[01-Apr-25 03:15 PM] pxlfox.#0000
If we can see bases per player, we should be able to calculate bases per planet (assuming we know where the players have there bases)


[01-Apr-25 03:15 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I will need to look into that


[01-Apr-25 03:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
I thought FIO has base data in the user data payload


[01-Apr-25 03:26 PM] sidepipe#0000
But then you‚Äôd need a list of all active company names or codes


[01-Apr-25 03:53 PM] jab.sh#0000
yeah, 11 days for triple green EXT üòÑ


[01-Apr-25 08:41 PM] evov#0000
Less so of an economic report... but I think it would be good to have a monthly report on all the active planets, their cogc's, pops - within 6 jumps of the ANT cx.

I think making it clear all the good options people have for expansion in the area might make it easier for people to grow/develop bases. Might also guide people towards prioritizing development in ANT space rather than other regions.


[01-Apr-25 08:42 PM] pagy1234#0000
Maybe how many new bases there are? And if possible a breakdown per system?


[01-Apr-25 08:42 PM] tanda#0000
a planetary development report would be a great thing. Probably a fun RP option too


[01-Apr-25 08:42 PM] tanda#0000
Highlight planets with population issues like Phobos and advise against current settlement until governments can react


[01-Apr-25 08:43 PM] tanda#0000
or maybe spotlight new developing planets that might be of good strategic value (Black Mesa and Lom Palanka *cough* *cough*)


[02-Apr-25 01:47 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I‚Äôm surprised people are more interested in the planets then the market üòÖüòÇ
I‚Äôll look into the data FIO provides and see, what we can do


[02-Apr-25 01:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
What are those population issues? Do they have not enough workers?


[02-Apr-25 01:48 AM] pxlfox.#0000
How should we spotlight them? By checking if they have rapid pop growth? Development of new infrastructure?


[02-Apr-25 01:54 AM] evov#0000
I suspect a lot of people already have some type of tool or process they use to look at the markets. Whereas the tools available for some of the less focused on things aren't as well developed imo.

Consumable cost per worker for each of the regions.

[02-Apr-25 01:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Costs per worker is an easy metric to generate, so no doubt everybody has a sheet for that. 
I wanted to generate a daily value and put them into a graph to see its development

[03-Apr-25 01:25 AM] pagy1234#0000
on a system map you can click on ships, an it tells you who owns then, although I would be suprised if that is how Tanda found where their ships are.

Let me throw your plan into my math machine


[04-Apr-25 09:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
and use the BEA + GRN + NUT recipe to make RAT because iirc its cheaper (way less water usage)


[04-Apr-25 09:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
also, I wouldnt put the FPs on harmonia, you will just end up moving them later on which will cost you quite a bit, make harmonia fully farming with just a few of FP's if nessessary, then expand later


[04-Apr-25 09:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000

[04-Apr-25 09:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
- don't extract water, buy it from the market
- use the space for more FP (or move them completely to another planet)
- use the BEA/GRN/NUT recipe like Appletree suggested


[04-Apr-25 09:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
depends on your current financial possibilities. If that's your first base, you might want to expand Harmonia first and move the FP later


[04-Apr-25 09:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but if you happen to have the funds for a second base, go for it


[04-Apr-25 09:58 AM] pxlfox.#0000
extracting water on Harmonia is _technically_ cheaper then the market sells, but the difference is negligible and the space is better invested for more FRM

I have seen loans on other channels. Is 3% interest high?


[04-Apr-25 10:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
iirc not really. Should be lower then the galactic inflation? @laaxus knows probably more


[04-Apr-25 10:15 AM] laaxus#0000
it's very low


[04-Apr-25 10:16 AM] laaxus#0000
3% weekly seems a lot in comparison to irl


[04-Apr-25 10:16 AM] laaxus#0000
but it's not tho


[04-Apr-25 10:16 AM] laaxus#0000
many base have a ROI of below 10


[04-Apr-25 10:16 AM] laaxus#0000
a 3% interest loan has a roi of 33 days


[04-Apr-25 10:17 AM] jvaler#0000
it's quite low. i copy the 3% figure from lowstrife to use for my own loans and it really isn't all that profitable. the money you tie up into handing out a 3% loan would have generated you 2x+ more income if you had put it into a new production base instead


[04-Apr-25 10:17 AM] laaxus#0000
(ROI is how many days to get the money back)


[04-Apr-25 10:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I think most of the bigger players loan out money to support the overall growth of the universe, not to make big profits


[04-Apr-25 10:19 AM] laaxus#0000
Lowstrife is the only one that succeeds at loaning


[04-Apr-25 10:19 AM] laaxus#0000
loaning at 3% is more profitable than most bases after permit 20


[04-Apr-25 10:20 AM] jvaler#0000
it's successful for him due to the scale he's able to do it at

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04-Apr-25 10:20 AM] laaxus#0000
it's impossible to compete with this rate because it would require a scale you can't have by competing


[04-Apr-25 10:20 AM] jvaler#0000
he could never properly invest that much money alone, so the loans are equivelant to having other players invest it for him and giving him a cut


[04-Apr-25 10:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
sounds about right


[04-Apr-25 10:22 AM] pxlfox.#0000
You might want to consider the ADI grant, if not already done. If you're happy with your plan, please post it into the #agp-operations channel to apply

[04-Apr-25 10:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
All details are noted in #agp-information , but bascially a PrunPlanner Link to your plan and a short description. After that, it will be reviewed and if somebody approves it, they send you the money. You'll need a Pro license, tho, to accept the contract.

lowstrife has mentioned recently that he has made about +- with his loans. Reason being that a few people leave the game and dont pay back the loan. And with only 3% interest it takes quite a few other loans to make up one loand not going thorugh


[04-Apr-25 10:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
yeah, isn't that what killed shrewdsun?


[04-Apr-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000

[04-Apr-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
he loaned an IDC base to a kid


[04-Apr-25 10:32 AM] getonthetrain#0000

[04-Apr-25 10:32 AM] laaxus#0000
that has not spend the money into IDC

the contract system can't take money you don't have on your balance


[04-Apr-25 10:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
and there is no system to liquidate assets to make cash


[04-Apr-25 10:34 AM] kk100762#0000
I think the game needs a space war system hh


[04-Apr-25 10:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It doesn't


[04-Apr-25 10:34 AM] laaxus#0000
PLEASE NO

thank you


[04-Apr-25 10:35 AM] jvaler#0000
if the player has the money in their balance the loan will be auto-paid, but if all their money is tied up in assets there is no system of automatically liquidating that to pay back the loan


[04-Apr-25 10:35 AM] laaxus#0000
not losing a ship at the end of a gateway is what makes me not leave the game

[04-Apr-25 10:35 AM] jvaler#0000

a bad in-game score

"extremly hard to _accidentally_ lose money" - if you try, it's quite easy xD


[04-Apr-25 10:38 AM] laaxus#0000
there's a litteral tool telling you if your base will make money or not


[04-Apr-25 10:38 AM] jvaler#0000
how did they end up getting ran off for good? were they banned or something? or did their "parent" take the game away from them for real?


[04-Apr-25 10:41 AM] laaxus#0000
memory is fuzzy, but if I remember correctly (take it with a grain of salt)
- Shrew and the parent had a long discussion (I can't imagine myself in Shrewd boots)
- Parent told that kid will pay the loan back once he earned it (the money was mostly wasted)
- Shrewd told the community it was ok and to please forget about it (probably decided to leave the game by then)
- The guy played a bit more then left the game for good


[04-Apr-25 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000
that sounds about right iirc too


[04-Apr-25 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000

If the interest rate is 3% per week.... the ROI would be 33 weeks... not 33 days.

This seems like a long time, but it's not really when you include the cost of permits for new bases.
Giving out loans that have an RoI of 7 or 8 months starts to make economic sense for people with high permit counts.

The differences do get resolved over time.

When it started looking like a MEA shortage a week or so ago, I shipped a few thousand MEA from the MOR market over to ANT to ensure supply. I did the same thing with other stuff that I felt would be affected ( stuff FP's make like -> FIM / COF etc )

[07-Apr-25 01:23 AM] evov#0000
That looks great. Can I make a request for 2 additions to it?
1. Is there a way to sort by various columns? i.e. I want to look at just planets with a Chem cogc.
2. Is it possible to add the number of jumps from the ANT CX each planet is?

My process (and I'd assume many people) when looking for a new base is like -> I know what industry Electronics/Chem etc I'm planning to build...  I want to know which planets are available with the right CoGC and then filter by 3 factors - distances from the CX, planet properties (hot/cold etc), current pop.


[07-Apr-25 01:27 AM] jab.sh#0000
I feel like prunplanner achieves all of that except pop


[07-Apr-25 01:30 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It does. The planet search function already does basically that. The only additional features are, that this list can be used in your own spreadsheets... and we can adjust it as we like ^^


[07-Apr-25 01:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I specifically made it a table, so you can sort and filter by the views. You probably need to copy it into your own workspace to do so, but should definitively be doable. 
I will make a template sheet in the future with different filtered views to accommodate those needs - like a view grouped by COGC, uninhabited planets, planets on strike, a.s.o. 
This was more of a test to see if it's even possible and to get the first opinions.


[07-Apr-25 01:34 AM] jab.sh#0000
of course, not trying to hate on your tool üòÜ was responding to Evo on that one


[07-Apr-25 01:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It should be doable to get the jump distance to the CX. Have to look into that, tho

I mean if prunplanner can do it then surely you should be able to

Historically, I've used fio to get this info. But. . . I find that sometimes the list is missing planets from it.

[07-Apr-25 01:41 AM] pxlfox.#0000

googlesheets has a function that allows you to filter individually (just for you own view)

The population numbers all look pretty right though.


[07-Apr-25 02:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Then probably because nobody is tracking them.
FIO data needs to be updated by the players via the browser extension. On every active planet the data should be updated regularly, as long as there is at least one player with the FIO extension enabled.


[07-Apr-25 02:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000

[07-Apr-25 02:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Those are sadly blind spots in the data we can‚Äôt really address, since those are technical limitations.
The only way to improve data quality is, if more players use the FIO extension and scrap more data üòÖ

[08-Apr-25 05:31 AM] pxlfox.#0000
This might be not that bad of an idea. I just need to scrape those planets, where we have coverage issues (like IA-158).
@evov I'm going to collect the data for those planets manually, so they appear in all FIO-based lists. If you find any other blackspots, let me know.


[08-Apr-25 05:34 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm currently not including the farlands of Antares (OWE, MG, WR, CG, EW, AU, etc.). Do you think they should be included in an Antares list, or are they not relevant for that?


[08-Apr-25 05:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
most of them are really far out and are completely uninhabited


[08-Apr-25 05:58 AM] evov#0000
I think only planets with an active CoGC / Gov are relevant. There's plenty of tools available to look for planets where you don't care about their populations/cogc's etc


[08-Apr-25 06:00 AM] magican1980#0000
I agree, but for my new LAB Base I needed Seddler / Technicans - so I had to look, where I can find a chem Planet with enough people. At least I found Origio.


[08-Apr-25 06:55 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Makes sense


[08-Apr-25 01:23 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Alright, next version is now available üôÇ

- I added the requested features: current open jobs, pop diffrence to last POPR and distance to CX
- The CSV file is now publicly available and can be imported into any sheet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebitkov/fio-extension/refs/heads/main/csv/planets/antares.csv
- I updated the Google Sheet document to import the CSV file and added a few views: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HtgEd4IweNmKBVO3ahCLG2XQE22SEpQWdDgRj8n8Qic/edit?usp=sharing

@evov as already mentioned, there isn't a good way atm to ensure full data coverage. Therefore, I will manually load in the data from IA-151 and IA-158. If you miss any other data, let me know. 

As always, I'm curious about what you think ^^

[08-Apr-25 11:30 PM] vanarazor#0000
I think for the uninhabited tab, I'd rather have the mats % available for extraction. anything else would be suited best for production


[08-Apr-25 11:32 PM] vanarazor#0000
and why not having the % of mats for for the COGC tab as well, sometimes it might be the right fit on one planet to have a hybrid production/extraction despite the COGC


[08-Apr-25 11:33 PM] vanarazor#0000
then since you have the pop available you can narrow it down even easier. Icing on a already very tasty piece of cake

[10-Apr-25 01:08 AM] razenpok#0000
Taxes are applied to production orders, not to pops. A 4h order in a 40 PIO building costs the same as 4h order in a 400 PIO building

Do you manually feed them into your chart?

I have a script, which takes the prices of a specific day, checks the price for the consumables and calculates the price for 100 pop. This is then saved to a CSV.

we have roundabout 300 active players at the same time - let it be at best 600 overall. All spread about 4 regions with there own markets and a lot of industries


[10-Apr-25 04:09 PM] jab.sh#0000

[11-Apr-25 07:37 AM] pagy1234#0000
Im about to set up my heph PSS/M/L base, PG base was earlier this week aswell, now I have a free permit and enough cash to do anything basically.


[11-Apr-25 07:38 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Either extend vertically


[11-Apr-25 07:38 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Or look for something the market needs


[11-Apr-25 07:38 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Or check what‚Äôs profitable atm


[11-Apr-25 07:40 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Or setup another IDC farm


[11-Apr-25 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
Nothing wrong with doing the same base multiple times


[11-Apr-25 08:08 AM] laaxus#0000
I have 3 CL bases and 2 EPO bases

Nix on the IDC, MEA is too volatile

For the love of god, don't invest in idc right now


[11-Apr-25 08:17 AM] pagy1234#0000
I was thinking about a couple of preliminary ideas: 
- Metallurgy base to allow for a bunch of new things, nothing specific yet so idk.
- Construction base on a triple green planet and make some UPFs to make some things :D 
- FEO base on SE-110d, just to use more of my STL ships and make use of the system where I already have so much stuff


[11-Apr-25 08:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
What sorts of things do you do right now? Maybe one of those makes more sense considering your current bases


[11-Apr-25 08:29 AM] laaxus#0000
You could Always make another FP base


[11-Apr-25 08:29 AM] laaxus#0000
It'll Never be bad


[11-Apr-25 08:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
Im making HER, FIM, CL, NA, HAL, H2O, and bit of COF


[11-Apr-25 08:29 AM] laaxus#0000
How many CL base do you have ?


[11-Apr-25 08:29 AM] pagy1234#0000
just one, and its not running properly yet


[11-Apr-25 08:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
Yeah, more CL is always an easy choice esp since you make HAL and H2O


[11-Apr-25 08:30 AM] laaxus#0000
You could make another


[11-Apr-25 08:30 AM] sidepipe#0000
Or you can try to get ahead of the KOM craze if you have enough HER


[11-Apr-25 08:30 AM] laaxus#0000
It's one of the most profitable base you Can make


[11-Apr-25 08:30 AM] pagy1234#0000
im already on a HER deficit because of FIM, so prolly not


[11-Apr-25 08:31 AM] laaxus#0000
And one HAL base on Halcyon produce more than enough for 2 CL bases


[11-Apr-25 08:31 AM] pagy1234#0000
rly? my electronica base will probably only make about 90k once its running fully


[11-Apr-25 08:31 AM] laaxus#0000

[11-Apr-25 08:31 AM] laaxus#0000

[11-Apr-25 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000

[11-Apr-25 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000

[11-Apr-25 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000
Look into the roi


[11-Apr-25 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000
That's where the profit lies


[11-Apr-25 08:32 AM] laaxus#0000
And yes, CL is overly profitable


[11-Apr-25 08:33 AM] pagy1234#0000
alr


[11-Apr-25 08:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
CL isn‚Äôt a bad choice. And if you want to do more interesting chemistry things later, you can convert the base to LABs and keep the experts - that‚Äôs how I managed to get DDT going so quickly üòÑ


[11-Apr-25 08:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
Where do you have your chem bases so far?


[11-Apr-25 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
What do you mean not a Bad choice


[11-Apr-25 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
It's one of the best choice one Can make atm


[11-Apr-25 08:35 AM] laaxus#0000
If not the best


[11-Apr-25 08:35 AM] sidepipe#0000
Which is by definition not bad üòõ


[11-Apr-25 08:36 AM] pagy1234#0000
electronica


[11-Apr-25 08:36 AM] laaxus#0000
Yes but still


[11-Apr-25 08:36 AM] magican1980#0000
if you have CL you can make a LAB Base f√ºr DDT üôÇ


[11-Apr-25 08:36 AM] sidepipe#0000
Come make CL on Griffonstone!


[11-Apr-25 08:37 AM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs cheap and I think it‚Äôs reasonably close to halcyon as well


[11-Apr-25 08:37 AM] laaxus#0000
You Can make a cl base on Griffon origo ki-840c electronica and yk-266d (I believe)


[11-Apr-25 08:37 AM] magican1980#0000
and my Base on Griffonstone is busy making (with 5 experts) to make CL and I hope to get the people for my lab at origo for DDT


[11-Apr-25 08:37 AM] laaxus#0000
I have m'y cl bases on electronica griffon and yk-266d


[11-Apr-25 08:38 AM] laaxus#0000
Despite being so profitable, CL Price still continue to rise


[11-Apr-25 08:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
because none of us DDT producers want to spend another permit on it üòÇ


[11-Apr-25 08:39 AM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôm running net -30 a day which isn‚Äôt bad, but I think there‚Äôs a few people who started LABs and dont make any of their own CL


[11-Apr-25 08:40 AM] magican1980#0000
I can go for another lab-Base or make more CL


[11-Apr-25 08:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
oh right PG is also on chem planet, yeah so next chem base will have to be on a red planet


[11-Apr-25 08:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
D:


[11-Apr-25 08:40 AM] pagy1234#0000
I have POL base on Griff


[11-Apr-25 08:42 AM] sidepipe#0000
Origo is probably a good next choice then


[11-Apr-25 09:06 AM] magican1980#0000
which planet is also a good Lab-Base? Origo is my first


[11-Apr-25 09:13 AM] sidepipe#0000
I think griff and origo are the best choices for LABs, they have the most established populations afaik. You could change your griff base to LABs and move your CL work to one of the other planets like electronica etc


[11-Apr-25 09:14 AM] sidepipe#0000
But check the popr before you do anything - I know some planets have been having shortages


[11-Apr-25 09:15 AM] magican1980#0000
Yes, this has I dont to find Origo for Technicans


[11-Apr-25 09:15 AM] pagy1234#0000
I see


[11-Apr-25 09:16 AM] pagy1234#0000
will try some plans in the planner


[11-Apr-25 09:17 AM] magican1980#0000
If you have 3 Permits, look for 1 HAL Extruder and 2 CL-Bases


[11-Apr-25 09:19 AM] magican1980#0000
The next thing, what I need to do is to reduce my Carbon production üò¶ with a lot changes


[11-Apr-25 09:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
already have one hal and one CL


[11-Apr-25 09:22 AM] pagy1234#0000
so just 1 cl I guess


[11-Apr-25 09:23 AM] magican1980#0000
yes, it should be burn your complete hal production


[11-Apr-25 09:27 PM] vanarazor#0000

The idea started with the goal of providing some SOI to the market, but a 500 area ORC base only needs 13 SOI so I tried to diversify the CHP production on this base


[12-Apr-25 04:40 AM] vanarazor#0000
but probably DDT production would suit the market better , ORC base ROI is 33d, probably becasue DT is so expensive and  Fermenter producer have vertically integraed their ORC


[12-Apr-25 04:49 AM] realharvey#0000
can you handle the daily costs of 198k for the inputs?


[12-Apr-25 04:52 AM] vanarazor#0000
160k for prod but produce HER CLI and HALwhich drops down to 114k 
30K for consumables but I produce everything but KOM

[14-Apr-25 02:13 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but the environmental costs make it not really profitable for a simple SME base


[14-Apr-25 07:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
How close is Hyalos? I think that‚Äôs a metallurgy planet


[14-Apr-25 07:48 AM] sidepipe#0000
I believe it‚Äôs in the WU sector as wel


[14-Apr-25 08:51 AM] akyantor#0000
It is.. though more commonly used for glass products due to the SIO avaialble on site. That said, could be a pure smelter if there's a suitable ore source nearby.


[14-Apr-25 09:27 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Hyalos is just one jump over, so a good candidate for smelting


[14-Apr-25 09:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
A full ext base there can extract 1,173 FEO per day - that‚Äôs nearly 4 full SME bases


[14-Apr-25 09:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Probably around 3 FE and 1 STL base


[14-Apr-25 09:28 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But tripple red makes it basically only viable for PIO, maybe SET at max


[14-Apr-25 09:40 AM] realharvey#0000
isn't tripple red worse for lower tier pop? Or am I thinking this wrong? Higher tier pop products usually have higher revenue numbers which negate higher repair/building costs


[14-Apr-25 10:33 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Normally, yes


[14-Apr-25 10:35 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But WU-013c is a) - an undeveloped world, which would make it way more expansive to build the infrastructure for higher pop tiers, and b) - has absurd yields, which are high enough to offset the higher building requirements.


[14-Apr-25 10:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But making the planet viable for a PIO extraction site is just doable


[14-Apr-25 10:36 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I talked with EvoV about it - might take roughly 2-3 mil to setup the most basic infrastructure


[14-Apr-25 10:37 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Another 1.5 mil for the base, if I remember correctly


[14-Apr-25 10:37 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But the base would output over 100k profit a day with the FEO price at 140, which is really good for an extraction base


[14-Apr-25 10:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I would love to establish that planet eventually, but as discussed in https://discord.com/channels/1183243037430796339/1183249178156089374/1361249012820217939, market doesn‚Äôt need that much of FE atm. Tho I didn‚Äôt looked at the upcoming MM remix, so maybe there are opportunities hidden somewhere‚Ä¶


[14-Apr-25 10:48 AM] realharvey#0000
I do believe FEO is smelted mostly onsite into FE and then into Steel, to reduce the insane shipping demand


[14-Apr-25 10:49 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Yep - Vulcan is already a basically perfect FE/STL base


[14-Apr-25 10:50 AM] pxlfox.#0000
With metals, you want to be as close to CX (or consumption site) as possible because of the mentioned higher shipping requirements


[14-Apr-25 10:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Ores are kinda doable, tho. They aren‚Äôt as heavy as the metals themselves and don‚Äôt require additional inputs, so it‚Äôs often fine to extract them a few jumps away


[14-Apr-25 10:51 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But the more yield a planet has, the more challenging it‚Äôs getting to transport all of it. The best planets often require multiple ships full time to transport all of it


[14-Apr-25 10:52 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But can also support multiple smelting bases


[14-Apr-25 10:53 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And yes, especially if you don‚Äôt need too much of it, on-side production and consumption is often preferred


[14-Apr-25 10:54 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I think smelters could benefit from additional logistic services. People would be more willing to buy from you, if you deliver the metals, too


[14-Apr-25 11:00 AM] realharvey#0000
lol you could get 1173 FEO out of that planet per day which needs 2 HCB's to handle


[14-Apr-25 11:00 AM] realharvey#0000
and not even all CX combined have that much traded feo


[14-Apr-25 11:00 AM] realharvey#0000
I tried to run a Ext + SME operation there aswell in prunplanner. Unfortunetely not really satisfying


[14-Apr-25 11:42 AM] laaxus#0000

Refined prun makes managing your base super easy. There is no such thing for govs. You need to check on new bases dropping, make your own timers for cogc and popi filling. Calculate wether immigration or festivities are needed for new bases etc.

[14-Apr-25 03:52 PM] jcheung#0000
there zero percent chance that the price for that is worth less than 18k unless you're getting it from a VI mfg


[14-Apr-25 03:53 PM] jcheung#0000
what's your profit/d if you bump DCH up to... 30k/u


[14-Apr-25 03:53 PM] pxlfox.#0000
let me check


[14-Apr-25 03:54 PM] pxlfox.#0000
350k per day


[14-Apr-25 03:54 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Bitkov Industries might becoming a drone factory...


[14-Apr-25 03:54 PM] jcheung#0000
the inputs for this also comes out to around 32k/u, which means at least 38k...


[14-Apr-25 03:55 PM] jcheung#0000
so try DCH @ 20k/u and BSC @ 40k/u


[14-Apr-25 03:55 PM] pxlfox.#0000

I already have AL, CU, AU and STL producing - and drones are mostly that


[14-Apr-25 03:57 PM] jcheung#0000
let's see


[14-Apr-25 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
need electronics, chemistry, mfg


[14-Apr-25 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
and metalurgy need a FS


[14-Apr-25 04:01 PM] pxlfox.#0000
let's continue in private üòâ


[14-Apr-25 04:03 PM] vanarazor#0000
Hey make me part of this


[14-Apr-25 04:03 PM] pxlfox.#0000
for anybody who's interested - here are some really basic plans with the new MM prices. Prices are taken with AI1_AVG.

[14-Apr-25 04:05 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm pretty sure we'll find a place somewhere. There are multiple drones which all look promising. Chains are decently long, so the more the better


[14-Apr-25 04:05 PM] pxlfox.#0000

I have a feeling those will need atrocious number of support bases


[14-Apr-25 11:51 PM] evov#0000
The Drone side of things is something that's kind of interesting that I've never done any work on before. I might put some time into looking at that production line and seeing if/where it makes sense to produce them.


[15-Apr-25 02:17 AM] jvaler#0000
why aren't you using something like pp30d? AI1 avg is fake(and useless)


[15-Apr-25 02:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
good point - let me see


[15-Apr-25 02:19 AM] pxlfox.#0000

[15-Apr-25 02:20 AM] pxlfox.#0000
but markets with no materials (like DCH) still won't show reasonable prices


[15-Apr-25 02:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
at the end, those are just indicators, not really a measurment on how the individual bases really will do


[15-Apr-25 02:39 AM] realharvey#0000
I feel like availablility of the required inputs will also play a big role


[15-Apr-25 03:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
definitely


[15-Apr-25 03:00 AM] pxlfox.#0000
many of those chains have probably thin to no markets

#agp-operations is the place


[15-Apr-25 06:07 PM] loans_13178#0000
Well this is for my first base so I'm not sure I want to waste that much money just yet.


[15-Apr-25 06:08 PM] loans_13178#0000
is there a way to like take a quick loan or something


[15-Apr-25 06:09 PM] jvaler#0000
waste?


[15-Apr-25 06:09 PM] jvaler#0000
i mean i offer loans at 3%, matched with lowstrife


[15-Apr-25 06:11 PM] loans_13178#0000
I'd do that, do you mind if its at 4% if I'm planning on paying it back over a long period.


[15-Apr-25 06:12 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah if the repayment period is too long i usually raise the interest rate


[15-Apr-25 06:12 PM] jvaler#0000
how long were you thinking?


[15-Apr-25 06:13 PM] loans_13178#0000
its a stable loan at 4% over 11 weeks


[15-Apr-25 06:15 PM] jvaler#0000
yeah that sounds fine with me


[15-Apr-25 06:15 PM] jvaler#0000
~~tbh i'm willing to just do 0% interest cause 40k is such a miniscule amount to me lmfao~~


[15-Apr-25 06:20 PM] loans_13178#0000
so just send the contract your way?


[15-Apr-25 06:23 PM] loans_13178#0000
If you could accept it within the next 15 minutes that'd be mighty helpful

if the price goes up enough, il consider dropping a base


[16-Apr-25 02:34 AM] pagy1234#0000
last i checked the roi wasnt good


[16-Apr-25 02:35 AM] laaxus#0000
I think the market needs like one GL base, maybe 2


[16-Apr-25 02:35 AM] laaxus#0000
so it's easy to over produce


[16-Apr-25 02:38 AM] laaxus#0000
I might just drop a leased base on vulcan


[16-Apr-25 02:38 AM] getonthetrain#0000

[16-Apr-25 02:39 AM] getonthetrain#0000
Hyalos is the spot


[16-Apr-25 02:40 AM] getonthetrain#0000
with upcoming MM changes, I think SI and SIO are going to be in much greater demand

Deimos golden age coming soon

yeah, the question of illiquidity also held me a little away from GL


[16-Apr-25 08:04 AM] loans_13178#0000
Also what is FIO and how do I set one up for Prun?


[16-Apr-25 08:06 AM] pagy1234#0000

lots of features you can use without setting anything up

it says the server is not responding?

oh nice


[16-Apr-25 02:01 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Just a quick one:
If anybody of you wants an easy way of getting the construction costs of a building - I have you covered: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebitkov/fio-extension/refs/heads/main/csv/building/construction_costs/AI1.csv

It's a list of every building in the game, it's base costs (ask) and additional environmental costs.


[16-Apr-25 02:01 PM] pxlfox.#0000
Will be updated daily, as soon as I configured the cronjob


[16-Apr-25 02:08 PM] jab.sh#0000
do you have a csv of each building and the type/quantity of each building material?


[16-Apr-25 02:08 PM] pxlfox.#0000
there is probably already a FIO endpoint for that


[16-Apr-25 02:08 PM] jab.sh#0000
well what are you doing to get that information? üòÑ


[16-Apr-25 02:09 PM] pxlfox.#0000
getting the data from a FIO endpoint üòÇ


[16-Apr-25 02:09 PM] pxlfox.#0000
but I use a JSON endpoint


[16-Apr-25 02:09 PM] jab.sh#0000
so by "probably" you mean "definitely"


[16-Apr-25 02:09 PM] jab.sh#0000
ah


[16-Apr-25 02:09 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I'm sure there is a CSV one

That is really hard to say


[19-Apr-25 12:12 AM] tanda#0000
it's going to crater initially, but it'll probably end up where it started in a few months (or more)

I think at the moment nobody really knows what will happen


[19-Apr-25 12:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000

Keep an eye open and you‚Äôll have a fun ride


[19-Apr-25 12:16 AM] vanarazor#0000
yeah it looks a few people have been dumping on MEA already


[19-Apr-25 12:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It‚Äôs a bit early for MEA to go down


[19-Apr-25 12:16 AM] vanarazor#0000
bids reached 5K


[19-Apr-25 12:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
I think a few people dumped there stocks as long as prices are high, since they probably expected them to fall eventually


[19-Apr-25 12:18 AM] tanda#0000
There is a LOT of production that just got stepped up, though


[19-Apr-25 12:18 AM] tanda#0000
a lot of IVPs that haven't paid themselves off yet

[19-Apr-25 12:57 AM] jcheung#0000
i expect a month or two of MEA prices being pretty damn low


[19-Apr-25 12:58 AM] jcheung#0000
then FIM to drop off a bit, then HER to drop


[19-Apr-25 12:58 AM] jcheung#0000
then MEA to stabilize at a reasonable price


[19-Apr-25 12:58 AM] jcheung#0000
maybe in 3-4 months


[19-Apr-25 04:26 AM] evov#0000
imo - mea will trend towards 4-5k, fim to 2-3k


[19-Apr-25 07:29 AM] vanarazor#0000

Ideally close to ANT


[19-Apr-25 02:04 PM] pxlfox.#0000
But they get expensive or are further away


[19-Apr-25 02:04 PM] jcheung#0000

[19-Apr-25 02:05 PM] pxlfox.#0000
not good


[19-Apr-25 02:05 PM] tanda#0000
The infrastructure is still there, the main issue is the shipping


[19-Apr-25 02:05 PM] tanda#0000
Because rise just had so many ships


[19-Apr-25 02:06 PM] jcheung#0000
okay, so like


[19-Apr-25 02:06 PM] jcheung#0000
IY-816C i know was a rise planet


[19-Apr-25 02:06 PM] jcheung#0000
but boy, are those PIO numbers tanking


[19-Apr-25 02:07 PM] tanda#0000
Well it's probably not being maintained


[19-Apr-25 02:07 PM] jcheung#0000
i think some bases also got pulled


[19-Apr-25 02:07 PM] tanda#0000
Good news: the expensive infrastructure is still there.


[19-Apr-25 02:08 PM] jcheung#0000
yeah, used to be 5k @30% unemployment, now is 3.7k @35%


[19-Apr-25 02:08 PM] jcheung#0000
so maybe will stabilize if more bases are made


[19-Apr-25 02:08 PM] tanda#0000
PIO pops are also cheap to maintain, and an ADM means they're quick to get (minimum of 200 per week)


[19-Apr-25 02:09 PM] jcheung#0000
crap. i can't remember where the other rise worlds were

Next one will be KI-401b, since it's right next to my CUO tap. I can reduce the shipping a bit there.

next to Harmonia aren't any Metallurgy planets... or am I missing something?

[19-Apr-25 03:26 PM] harkenn#0000
Any specific thoughts on this base design would be appreciated. Was considering applying for the AGP with it https://prunplanner.org/shared/7eade9cf-3ad9-428a-b28d-dcb6c6746f4b (On Nike)

[19-Apr-25 03:29 PM] jcheung#0000
i would suggest dropping some of the PP1's


[19-Apr-25 03:30 PM] jcheung#0000
they don't do great


[19-Apr-25 03:31 PM] jcheung#0000
consider also dabbling in the other lfabs with your pp2 as well


[19-Apr-25 03:33 PM] jcheung#0000
other than that, even as is it's not bad


[19-Apr-25 03:33 PM] jcheung#0000
are you trying to consume your AL production at deimos?


[19-Apr-25 03:34 PM] harkenn#0000
No, unfortunately that's accounted for in DNPC


[19-Apr-25 03:35 PM] jcheung#0000
ah


[19-Apr-25 03:35 PM] jcheung#0000
that's unfortunate


[19-Apr-25 03:37 PM] harkenn#0000
Yep, I figure with the revenue from that, though, and what i can get stood up from an AGP grant, I could max out the 3 initial permits either w/ a 2nd (or expanded) construction base, or something supplying mats for construction to increase its profitability and upgrade HQ in as quick a timeframe as is feasible. Let me play around w/ this and see what might work better than the PPT1s.


[19-Apr-25 03:38 PM] harkenn#0000
The BDEs had a pretty good per day return, but I'll take you at your word that there's something better


[19-Apr-25 03:39 PM] pxlfox.#0000
I personally wouldn't go for a PP1/PP2 base atm


[19-Apr-25 03:39 PM] jcheung#0000
if you want a base to go with it, while not an ideal base... this could do something for you (if your nike base remains the same)
https://prunplanner.org/shared/d10895fb-d97f-4eee-b480-ef7745210747
at nascent you can often pick up C cheaper than CX, but it's really not ideal for metallurgy

[19-Apr-25 03:39 PM] pxlfox.#0000
at least not as your second one


[19-Apr-25 03:39 PM] jcheung#0000
however it's not too expensive to set up and reduces your AL consumption


[19-Apr-25 03:40 PM] jcheung#0000
and later on you can move it to more ALO extraction and less refining, and support another base for AL refining


[19-Apr-25 03:40 PM] jcheung#0000
like nike - D


[19-Apr-25 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
alternatively you can move to a mix of C burn and ALO extraction when you offload smelting, then you can feed your smelters efficiently from one place


[19-Apr-25 03:42 PM] harkenn#0000
Oh, I didn't realize changing my plan would actually prevent you from seeing the initial one.


[19-Apr-25 03:42 PM] jcheung#0000
ah, yes it updates the share link


[19-Apr-25 03:42 PM] harkenn#0000
Whelp this new plan seems better


[19-Apr-25 03:43 PM] harkenn#0000
73.5 / day, just without any storage, which I think I can manage.


[19-Apr-25 03:43 PM] jcheung#0000
i would consider the STO


[19-Apr-25 03:43 PM] jcheung#0000
otherwise you visit every other day


[19-Apr-25 03:44 PM] harkenn#0000
Yeah, but I don't have anything else going on atm, and the DNPC doesn't require any shipping. I'd have to cut either a PP2 or PP3 which then means I'd have excess workforce


[19-Apr-25 03:44 PM] jcheung#0000
as a side note, i don't know if you noticed that Nike is a good LST extraction spot-you can often find LST on the LM for less than CX


[19-Apr-25 03:47 PM] harkenn#0000
yeah, just gotta find Epoxy on the market at less than CX üòÜ


[19-Apr-25 03:47 PM] jcheung#0000
good luck üòÑ


[19-Apr-25 03:56 PM] harkenn#0000
Oh...this plan also dramatically exceeds the grant amount, lol. For some reason the construction cart didn't have all the buildings


[19-Apr-25 03:56 PM] harkenn#0000
PP2 / PP3 base is ~1.6mil


[19-Apr-25 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
start with a partial


[19-Apr-25 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
submit the plan as a whole, but only build half of it to start


[19-Apr-25 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
actually maybe less than half


[19-Apr-25 03:59 PM] jcheung#0000
you need to save enough to get feedstock and for "oops i screwed up" money


[19-Apr-25 04:03 PM] harkenn#0000
Right, but at half the profitability is ~29k a day. That would require an entire month to generate the income necessary to finish the base and get up to full profitability. Or I could build ~80% of the PP1 / PP2 base (leaving a buffer for feedstock and oopsy money) and be capable of producing the mats I need to repurpose that base into the PP2/PP3 base at some point?


[19-Apr-25 04:09 PM] jcheung#0000
or


[19-Apr-25 04:09 PM] jcheung#0000
you can take out a loan, if you're not adverse to it


[19-Apr-25 04:10 PM] jcheung#0000
plus you have DNPC income as well


[19-Apr-25 04:10 PM] jcheung#0000
you can wait until you get a split from them and send that over


[19-Apr-25 04:12 PM] jcheung#0000
then once you have your PP2's up you can use them to make the Lfabs you need for PP3


[19-Apr-25 04:13 PM] jcheung#0000
looks like dnpc does... weekly splits?


[19-Apr-25 04:15 PM] jcheung#0000
so you would buy the BDE, PSL, TRU, MCG, SEA, LTA, LBH


[19-Apr-25 04:15 PM] jcheung#0000
some feedstock


[19-Apr-25 04:15 PM] jcheung#0000
figure out how much the split will get you


[19-Apr-25 04:16 PM] jcheung#0000
however much you need to finish up the PP2's, then plan to build the most expensive Lfabs and buy the cheap ones


[19-Apr-25 04:16 PM] jcheung#0000
at least that's what i would think about doing if i didn't want to take a loan


[19-Apr-25 04:18 PM] jcheung#0000
for example, i would buy LSE and build LDE


[19-Apr-25 04:18 PM] jcheung#0000
and ofc if you have a lot left over you can buy PP3 materials as well


[19-Apr-25 05:02 PM] tanda#0000
It really is cheaper than you think (especially if you just look for the abandoned planets and steal their infrastructure)


[19-Apr-25 08:29 PM] vanarazor#0000

Oh well. If it dips lower it just means I'll have my stockpile reestablished and be ready to shift permits around that much sooner.

I spent a couple hours looking at AIR production, and I conclude that with 31 million and 6 permits I could get 720K profit/d which is 42days ROI but if the MM does not change, 

it is actually very liquid.

this project does not include any extraction permits which means that this could stimulate ever
 so slightly ALO/SIO/FEO/AUO/LST/CUO/HE/O/C/H ( H2O?) 

However 5 of theses permits still have room on the 1 permit base

Have you guys looked into AIR production?


[22-Apr-25 10:28 PM] tanda#0000
Yes


[22-Apr-25 10:28 PM] tanda#0000
Keep in mind that if you're actually doing AIR production, you're not going to do the smelting for it


[22-Apr-25 10:29 PM] tanda#0000
SME bases are low margin enough you shouldn't really consider them (until the market goes nuts)


[22-Apr-25 11:06 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah they are not high margins but so is the construction/manufacturing/chemistry

most of theses permits are not saturated there is still room to build which means


[22-Apr-25 11:08 PM] vanarazor#0000
and the idea of doing the smelting was in case of market crashes and using ores market value retaining properties

[22-Apr-25 11:49 PM] vanarazor#0000
yeah but this bundles could be considered as an asset that freeze mats value in time, say that you have vertically integrated consumables for pioneers and produced a PBU on monday and you see on tuesday the price on certain goods/mats/consumables getting more expensive than monday, you might still have a monday PBU ?


[22-Apr-25 11:50 PM] jab.sh#0000
what


[22-Apr-25 11:50 PM] jab.sh#0000
you can always unbundle and sell it or whatever


[22-Apr-25 11:50 PM] vanarazor#0000
in other words you could save up theses bundles for rainy days and sustain market changes for theses consumables ?

[24-Apr-25 10:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
POL on ZV-639d is also a consideration


[24-Apr-25 10:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
but its shipping intensive


[24-Apr-25 10:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
and roi is meh


[24-Apr-25 10:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
other wise i was looking at SE-110e, for another FP -> DW+COF base


[24-Apr-25 10:48 AM] pagy1234#0000
but expensive and POP is nonexistant


[24-Apr-25 10:49 AM] pagy1234#0000
if I go there I will have to wait a while for pop to come


[24-Apr-25 10:54 AM] laaxus#0000
POL for pg, definitly

my griff base is fine


[24-Apr-25 10:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
(like 23 d or something)


[24-Apr-25 10:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
but all the good chem planets are too far for me, or expensive


[24-Apr-25 10:57 AM] laaxus#0000
you have a base on electronica origo ki-840c and yk-266c ?


[24-Apr-25 10:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
i got electronica, origo, griff


[24-Apr-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
not the last 2


[24-Apr-25 10:58 AM] pagy1234#0000
but iirc they are far as shit


[24-Apr-25 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
FTL is fast


[24-Apr-25 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
and chemistry usually requires little shipping


[24-Apr-25 10:58 AM] laaxus#0000
so it doesn't really matter


[24-Apr-25 10:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
POL needs full WCB every like 5 days


[24-Apr-25 10:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
which for me is alot


[24-Apr-25 10:59 AM] laaxus#0000
yeah, for pol you usually need a LCB


[24-Apr-25 10:59 AM] pagy1234#0000

Yeah - I‚Äôve actually been exporting some of my SI to other places to make money on it üòÑ


[24-Apr-25 02:05 PM] laaxus#0000
a sio base is really shipping intensive


[24-Apr-25 02:05 PM] tanda#0000
yeah, part of why I think Norwick is probably a good idea


[24-Apr-25 02:06 PM] tanda#0000
unless you have the ship to dedicate to Hyalos


[24-Apr-25 02:14 PM] jcheung#0000
Here i was thinking about starting a base to make SI or hire someone to make some for me... how much SI do you make, and what target price are you looking for


[24-Apr-25 02:23 PM] sidepipe#0000
I‚Äôll get back to you when I have my PC - I make a bit for my BWS base since I had to run some GF on Hyalos anyway, but it might not be enough to share. And anyway, it might be cheaper to get it from the CX üòÑ

new MM's are juicy


[25-Apr-25 12:39 PM] evov#0000
Kind of funny. If the PSM order book looked like that a few weeks ago I wouldn't have felt the need to build another base or two to make more myself.

The nature of complex manufacturing is that they're quite long production chains, and if any link in that chain becomes unavailable, the whole production line grinds to a halt. I had repeated shortages with a lot of the plastics being either unavailable or way too expensive. And now I run 49x PPF's myself so it's not really a problem I have to worry about for a while I'd think.


[25-Apr-25 12:44 PM] igfloz#0000
I was kind of getting into this myself üëÜ - but with electronic basics.
With my Pro licence coming to an end, I'll be  bringing down that production, so there will probably be listings of things like MB, PCB etc. in the near future on the CX

[26-Apr-25 02:54 AM] laaxus#0000
most of the time, net 0 is impossible


[26-Apr-25 02:54 AM] pagy1234#0000

[26-Apr-25 02:54 AM] pagy1234#0000
I can get all the WAI inputs to 0, not the IMM tho


[26-Apr-25 02:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
wait, not the WAI


[26-Apr-25 02:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
well i balanced something earlier


[26-Apr-25 03:00 AM] vanarazor#0000
try for AIR , it's fun


[26-Apr-25 03:00 AM] vanarazor#0000
most of the time I end up with permit not fully used


[26-Apr-25 03:01 AM] vanarazor#0000
which sounds like a few hybrid permits


[26-Apr-25 03:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
I did look at that earlier aswell, but theres just too many steps D:


[26-Apr-25 03:03 AM] laaxus#0000
nice


[26-Apr-25 03:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
I tried to make the full AIR chain in 1 base


[26-Apr-25 03:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
but theres like 20 building so it wasnt even close to fitting


[26-Apr-25 03:31 AM] evov#0000

I also think the new MM list is interesting because I think if you asked 10 different people to rank order the new MM's in terms of their appeal / perceived profitability.... you'd probably get 10 very different lists.


[26-Apr-25 03:41 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah probably


[26-Apr-25 03:42 AM] pagy1234#0000
would it be better to have slight underproduciton of inputs, to maximise final outputs, or slight overproduction of inputs to have some extra?


[26-Apr-25 04:00 AM] evov#0000
Depends how confident you are on the CX being able to supply inputs when you run low.


[26-Apr-25 04:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
I mean more that I just sacrifice that buildings run time


[26-Apr-25 04:03 AM] pagy1234#0000
like, I could either leave a bunch of area in my base, or maximise the final product, even if I lose a tiny bit of value on the buildings


[26-Apr-25 04:05 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm honestly excited with the new MM changes


[26-Apr-25 04:05 AM] laaxus#0000
I think the game will become much more interesting


[26-Apr-25 04:06 AM] evov#0000
The pop upkeep change for Govs  (I haven't looked too closely at yet)  might also make a whole lot of other materials suddenly have demand.


[26-Apr-25 04:06 AM] laaxus#0000
and I think those who invests the most time into searching and analyzing the market, will be more rewarded than currently

[26-Apr-25 04:44 AM] laaxus#0000
isn't it like 200k+ per permit


[26-Apr-25 04:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
SNM is bloody expensive


[26-Apr-25 04:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
i changed the price of SNM to only what it costs me to make it


[26-Apr-25 04:47 AM] pagy1234#0000
now its profitable


[26-Apr-25 04:53 AM] laaxus#0000
set buy at buy and sell at buy, to estime the profitability of a supply line


[26-Apr-25 04:53 AM] laaxus#0000
another way is to fix the prices of goods, empire wide


[26-Apr-25 04:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah


[26-Apr-25 04:55 AM] pagy1234#0000
thats what I did now


[26-Apr-25 04:57 AM] pagy1234#0000
actually, it probably would be more that 200k per permit, if you could actually make any of the inputs with that much volume


[26-Apr-25 05:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah I wasted like 2h on ts


[26-Apr-25 05:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
idk why


[26-Apr-25 05:05 AM] laaxus#0000
Just because you did not have the expected result doesn't mean it was wasted Time, imho


[26-Apr-25 05:34 AM] pagy1234#0000
true, at least I discovered that is was bad


[26-Apr-25 05:48 AM] bishopsix#0000

[26-Apr-25 05:50 AM] pagy1234#0000

Question, lets say I have 3 farms, to produce 1 RAT I need 3 farms to do 3 different orders, is there any way to group these farms in separate production lines based on their output? Or do I need to always choose a different recipe everytime I want to switch to a new output in the production tab aka 1 big long ass prod line?


[26-Apr-25 06:28 AM] vanarazor#0000

Right ok, let me know if this makes sense, no no wait.


[26-Apr-25 06:29 AM] bishopsix#0000
So I want to make RAT, I need 3 ingredients = 3 farms producing them


[26-Apr-25 06:29 AM] bishopsix#0000
right?


[26-Apr-25 06:30 AM] bishopsix#0000
So, do I need to manually assign these 3 items everytime in the production screen

under New Order


[26-Apr-25 06:31 AM] bishopsix#0000
Cuz like, if I want 6 farms, I don't want to click 1451023 times in new order to select a different farming output everytime


[26-Apr-25 06:31 AM] bishopsix#0000
perhaps I might be explaining too badly sorry about that


[26-Apr-25 06:31 AM] vanarazor#0000
you choose the recipe that suits you and there is an option for "_Recurring order_"

[26-Apr-25 06:32 AM] bishopsix#0000
okay so once that gets done, it automatically starts a new order based on the production template?


[26-Apr-25 06:33 AM] vanarazor#0000
I use prplanner to see what recipe could be good profits, I check the in game market. then For me, I usually do the same recipe in one base and click on recurring until the economical environment changes, then I update or cancel my recipe for a better option

[26-Apr-25 06:34 AM] vanarazor#0000
the good thing about recurring option, is that you can from let's say your 13 FRM set up different recipe in repeat  and you can see the % of distribution

[26-Apr-25 08:33 AM] jcheung#0000
It kinda depends. I like to try to be within 5-10 units of 0, anything closer than that is reserved for low production to start like WAI


[26-Apr-25 08:34 AM] jcheung#0000
As for over or under, i look at the cx. If the market looks healthy, even if slightly overpriced i won't care about being under

but the shipping is huge


[26-Apr-25 05:01 PM] loans_13178#0000
with base ships I would likely have to make at least 3-4 trips a day


[26-Apr-25 05:02 PM] tanda#0000
that's a pretty good indicator that it's not a worthwhile base


[26-Apr-25 05:02 PM] .urpalhal#0000
What about the WCB ship 3000 t 1000 m3?


[26-Apr-25 05:02 PM] loans_13178#0000
how much would that be?


[26-Apr-25 05:03 PM] loans_13178#0000
well this is planning for full land use so i'm trying to math out how much time I would have before it makes sense to just get a larger ship.


[26-Apr-25 05:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Check #psk-information


[26-Apr-25 05:03 PM] .urpalhal#0000
You can upgrade your starter ships


[26-Apr-25 05:04 PM] .urpalhal#0000
It‚Äôs like 1.2 mill or something


[26-Apr-25 05:04 PM] tanda#0000
including the ship upgrades necessary to run this base, your ROI on it immediately jumps up to 40days


[26-Apr-25 05:05 PM] loans_13178#0000
yes so I plan to use base ships with the Antares Grant and then build it up from the revenue off of my production.


[26-Apr-25 05:08 PM] igfloz#0000

look up for chem bases, ROI are pretty good and not too much shipping


[26-Apr-25 05:24 PM] loans_13178#0000
Honestly my first base is so convoluted and messy I'm pretty sure it only makes a profit because its basically self sustaining except for luxury consumables.


[26-Apr-25 05:24 PM] vanarazor#0000
I've made the same mistake at the start


[26-Apr-25 05:25 PM] .urpalhal#0000
Like you make OVE, DW and RAT there but then mainly make something else?


[26-Apr-25 05:25 PM] vanarazor#0000
a convoluted first base that self sustain does not allow you for much profit either


[26-Apr-25 05:25 PM] vanarazor#0000

If the changes seem like they'll stick around long term, and greatly affect profits, then I will tear things down and rework.

But if its less than like, 15% I'l just kinda shrug and go with it. Maybe start using it to produce something else.

The price was right. And I'm still waiting for the new PPF's I put down to actually out-produce what I need. I still think there's a lot of good demand for PPF bases going forward.

I also think it would be a good idea for people to look into Welding plants. There's a few things there that are running low and already quite profitable.


[27-Apr-25 02:39 AM] laaxus#0000
The more I look at the new MM, the more I agree that there will be demand for ppf products


[27-Apr-25 02:40 AM] laaxus#0000
but this demand doesn't materialize quite yet


[27-Apr-25 02:40 AM] laaxus#0000
btw, I think it's time to buy out moria again

PP2 is very shipping intensive, except for LTA
PP3 base is quite costly
PP4 base, don't even think about it


[27-Apr-25 02:51 AM] pagy1234#0000
TRU looks great on that


[27-Apr-25 02:51 AM] evov#0000
Right now - most of the welding stuff is solid.
Things that will be affected by the MM changes imo - FC big time. Also FLP to an extent.


[27-Apr-25 02:52 AM] evov#0000
TRU I "feel" like it's short supplied, but can't be sure. SSC is already quite expensive / very profitable.

Ignore DRF - can make it cheaper in the drone plant.
CHA is .... I'd buy it now if it were available. But it's a very low traded item so prices/volumes don't make sense.


[27-Apr-25 02:54 AM] laaxus#0000
I'd say, if you want to do a WEL base, go for it


[27-Apr-25 02:54 AM] laaxus#0000
the light seems as green as possible to me


[27-Apr-25 02:55 AM] laaxus#0000
- cost of base is low
- high profitability at ask
- still profitable at bid
- a large number of viable recipes
- not very shipping intensive


[27-Apr-25 02:55 AM] .urpalhal#0000
I mean I‚Äôd make more CHA‚Ä¶.


[27-Apr-25 02:56 AM] pagy1234#0000
yeah, super flexible aswell, all the top items in WEL use AL and HE, only some have an extra item

TRU an SSC are high volume / reliable items. So even if some of the more niche things take a while to sell, you'll always have something to fall back on.

If I were to make a WEL base, should I make it somewhere like Aceland which is close to CX, or somewhere like IA-151 where I could easily expand and vertically integrate stuff


[27-Apr-25 03:56 AM] laaxus#0000
depends


[27-Apr-25 03:56 AM] laaxus#0000
do you plan to build many construction planets ?


[27-Apr-25 03:57 AM] laaxus#0000
if so, you should keep planets close to the cx for the most shipping intensive ones


[27-Apr-25 03:57 AM] laaxus#0000
if not, Aceland nike are great


[27-Apr-25 03:59 AM] pagy1234#0000
hmm, what I was thinking is that if I were to later vertically integrate something, then it would be better to have the planets close to each other, rather than close to the CX


[27-Apr-25 04:00 AM] laaxus#0000
I don't think you want to vertically integrate WEL products


[27-Apr-25 04:01 AM] pagy1234#0000
Yeah, maybe not


[27-Apr-25 04:02 AM] pagy1234#0000
Nike is probably best


[27-Apr-25 04:02 AM] laaxus#0000
both nike and aceland are great


[27-Apr-25 04:10 AM] vanarazor#0000

Nike aceland are not that much more expensive than 3 greens


[27-Apr-25 04:12 AM] vanarazor#0000
yeah true NIke and Aceland are probably the only cheap construction planets


[27-Apr-25 04:12 AM] pagy1234#0000
they both only need SEA, which is about 60-70k for a base

I still remember a time where you said there cant be enough CL production

it's still very good atm

but that's fine


[27-Apr-25 12:36 PM] jab.sh#0000
and the change isn't even live


[27-Apr-25 12:38 PM] razenpok#0000
There's still an endless demand for EPO, so it should be fine


[27-Apr-25 12:38 PM] laaxus#0000
if price continue to drop, I might start buying my CL out of the CX


[27-Apr-25 12:39 PM] tanda#0000

even when considering selling into the very last bid (3400/u) it still has a roi of 13d, which shows how stupidly op it used to be

[27-Apr-25 12:43 PM] laaxus#0000
anyway, older player will start to ditch their CL bases and price will correct itself


[27-Apr-25 12:43 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm not worried


[27-Apr-25 12:44 PM] sidepipe#0000
It‚Äôs just one of those bases that has a good ROI but there‚Äôs better options if you have more cash, so it seems like people start with CHP and then grow into LABs or other bases


[27-Apr-25 12:44 PM] laaxus#0000
exactly, same as pp1


[27-Apr-25 12:44 PM] laaxus#0000

controlling for that CL price, the base still has a 14 day ROI


[27-Apr-25 12:47 PM] tanda#0000
it'll last until I need the cash, so maybe I'll get some hits


[27-Apr-25 12:48 PM] laaxus#0000
understandable


[27-Apr-25 12:49 PM] tanda#0000
though, honestly, I don't think I've ever seen it that low, and the 180 day is showing that this current price 3700/unit is "market normal"


[27-Apr-25 12:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it was this low over a year ago


[27-Apr-25 12:50 PM] sidepipe#0000
I think it was selling at 3200 when I started my 3rd ever base on Griff


[27-Apr-25 12:50 PM] laaxus#0000
it's ok, worst come to worst, I can control prices through leased bases


[27-Apr-25 12:51 PM] tanda#0000
my demand will only increase, btw. I have no plans to drop CHP bases for CL production


[27-Apr-25 12:52 PM] sidepipe#0000
Imo right now is the perfect time to drop CL bases because other folks will be getting rid of theirs üòÑ


[27-Apr-25 12:53 PM] tanda#0000
you're probably right, but I don't want that shipping issue yet

Maybe this will drive HAL down too

[27-Apr-25 01:03 PM] laaxus#0000
I'm kinda controlling the price


[27-Apr-25 01:04 PM] laaxus#0000
I don't think the price will go lower than 270/u anytime soon


[27-Apr-25 05:12 PM] igfloz#0000
Well, I think I'm just gonna start bringing bases down - gonna take a while to bring everything back to the CX


[27-Apr-25 05:25 PM] vanarazor#0000
this snowball took weeks to build up but now is going very fast downhill, eh ?


[27-Apr-25 05:30 PM] igfloz#0000

PrunPlanner is only showing the numbers. The thinking has to be done by the one looking at the numbers


[29-Apr-25 07:28 AM] vanarazor#0000
I think he s talking about the fact that tabs are half cut ->"/n" /resolution / <div> style*..

on the other hand how great would that be that JUI would actually have an audience ?


[29-Apr-25 07:36 AM] realharvey#0000
If there'd be a market for jui no one would pay that much for it. 
When looking at a production chain I always check how much money I'd save by producing it myself. If that revenue is 150k+ per day I'll make it myself lol

profit is obviously going to be less


[30-Apr-25 02:54 PM] jvaler#0000
yes that's too cheap for ALO


[30-Apr-25 02:55 PM] jab.sh#0000
ALO on the CX is at 150 but it was as low as 105 a few weeks ago


[30-Apr-25 02:55 PM] jvaler#0000
but ALO has always been undervalued afaik so


[30-Apr-25 02:56 PM] jab.sh#0000
FINPR says that base is 55k/day profit (and it's only at 391 ALO/day), but then my RAT/DW comes from AFC, BSE comes from DNPC, so I get those for under market prices.

0 experts?

[01-May-25 03:15 AM] laaxus#0000
Antares market is seeing major changes


[01-May-25 03:16 AM] vanarazor#0000
we need a gazette about economics of the Prosperous universe


[01-May-25 03:16 AM] vanarazor#0000
that gives information about the number of active players monthly


[01-May-25 03:16 AM] vanarazor#0000
and how big are theses players


[01-May-25 03:17 AM] vanarazor#0000
that could allow us to interpret better


[01-May-25 03:17 AM] vanarazor#0000
what if a 3 big players left and they had 30+ bases, that;s literally 90+ base that the universe market loses


[01-May-25 03:18 AM] vanarazor#0000
as an investor in this market I 'd pay to have this information from a reliable source


[01-May-25 03:20 AM] laaxus#0000
best we have is economic reports


[01-May-25 03:21 AM] vanarazor#0000
where can I consult theses reports?


[01-May-25 03:21 AM] laaxus#0000
on the forum somewhere, can't give you a link


[01-May-25 03:22 AM] laaxus#0000
try to look for "report" on this discord and the official one


[01-May-25 05:17 AM] pxlfox.#0000
The problem with that is, that we (players) simply don‚Äôt have that information. All we have is FIO and what we can guess out of that


[01-May-25 05:18 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But many players are reconfiguring multiple permits to adjust to the new MM prices. That‚Äôs something we can‚Äôt predict and will need to wait how the markets react


[01-May-25 08:31 AM] jcheung#0000
Not only that


[01-May-25 08:32 AM] jcheung#0000
You have several large players just dropping out at the same time

true 

[01-May-25 09:03 AM] pxlfox.#0000
That adds to it‚Ä¶


[01-May-25 09:04 AM] laaxus#0000
I mean, just with fire leaving, the amount of money printed went down quite a lot


[01-May-25 09:05 AM] laaxus#0000
so yes, I believe we will have deflation


[01-May-25 09:05 AM] pxlfox.#0000
But deflation in this game will mostly mean lower prices, won‚Äôt it?


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
lower prices means lower profit / d


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
lower profit / d means lower price


[01-May-25 09:06 AM] laaxus#0000
they're equivalent


[01-May-25 09:10 AM] jcheung#0000
i wouldn't count on that


[01-May-25 09:10 AM] pxlfox.#0000
Sure, I just wanted to say, that inflation and deflation isn‚Äôt really affecting gameplay that much, except maybe the early game


[01-May-25 09:11 AM] laaxus#0000
Certainly


[01-May-25 10:11 AM] pxlfox.#0000
@laaxus I think I'm going to disband my coorp for now and revive it later as a part of ADI. I really want that [ADI] tag...


[01-May-25 10:12 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And I have to setup a base on Heph... don't know what, tbh


[01-May-25 10:12 AM] laaxus#0000
That ADI tag is dope


[01-May-25 10:12 AM] laaxus#0000
Ping me when you're ready to join


[01-May-25 10:13 AM] getonthetrain#0000
just throw a WPL base on Heph, its cheap and low logistics since making NL only needs PG


[01-May-25 10:13 AM] getonthetrain#0000
can change it up later if needed


[01-May-25 10:13 AM] laaxus#0000
Yeah, WPL is a safe bet


[01-May-25 10:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
how do I leave a coorp?


[01-May-25 10:14 AM] pxlfox.#0000
found it


[01-May-25 10:15 AM] pxlfox.#0000
ok, ready @laaxus


[01-May-25 10:16 AM] pxlfox.#0000

or an even higher one

I hope for CULT to join one day as well but I'm probably hoping for too much


[01-May-25 10:21 AM] pxlfox.#0000
~~CULT and ADI should join imo - they are basically two sides of the same idea~~


[01-May-25 10:25 AM] laaxus#0000
I'm not one to Say what they should do


[01-May-25 10:34 AM] bishopsix#0000
What does the OOG tag have?


[01-May-25 10:39 AM] pxlfox.#0000
It's the tag of the OOG Capital Managment Corp:

The biggest Corporation in the universe


[01-May-25 10:40 AM] jvaler#0000
it kinda already does imo
we're way bigger than them member count wise, and we're more visible in our operations


[01-May-25 10:41 AM] jvaler#0000
as in like the grant program vs governance in the background


[01-May-25 10:41 AM] laaxus#0000
ADI the organisation, yes


[01-May-25 10:41 AM] laaxus#0000
ADI, the in game corporation, well it have to start somewhere


[01-May-25 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000
i mean it represents the same thing, no?


[01-May-25 10:42 AM] jvaler#0000

It's just a handful now


[01-May-25 10:44 AM] pxlfox.#0000
And OOG is more or less in every parlament of the region


[01-May-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000
OOG thing is politics so no surprise


[01-May-25 10:45 AM] laaxus#0000

please do a little research (or ask questions here) before you just jump on the top ones üòÑ a lot of the top ones have no market liquidity (either for inputs or outputs or both) or very high shipping requirements. also you probably want to target a base that's around $1M or less


[01-May-25 01:49 PM] mevnav#0000
So basically instead of jumping into making Medium STL Fuel Tank Kits I'd want to focus on making something with higher market velocity, like aluminum or lithium

LIO / LI can be slow too - although I will be dumping LIO on the CX soon

more than liquidity, you should take a look at how much the market can buy

I doubt the market can eat one entire base of LI


[01-May-25 01:52 PM] mevnav#0000
Right, I don't wanna spend all my money making something that nobody wants to buy, or I can't get ahold of the materials for


[01-May-25 01:52 PM] laaxus#0000
for your first base, you want something that make money and will always make money


[01-May-25 01:53 PM] laaxus#0000
once you have a stable income, and a better understand of the game and the market, then you could go to more unstable mat

Since Deimos is an an ALO planet, probably aluminum


[01-May-25 01:53 PM] igfloz#0000
Deimos as a starter is good because you could extract ALO & O and smelt into AL all on 1 planet - the only thing you have to transport is burn items (food / luxuries etc)  and export AL. Moving the ores around is hard with starter ships


[01-May-25 01:53 PM] laaxus#0000
yeah, my recommendation is a SME base, with ext on deimos to mine your own alo, reducing shipping


[01-May-25 01:54 PM] laaxus#0000
that's what I did when I started
