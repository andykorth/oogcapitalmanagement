So on what is everybody stuck? I have a stockpile of SP and can produce POW.

[31-May-22 03:51 PM] rune_242#0000

This is also equivalent to a core module teleport on KI-401b, if anyone were so inclined..


[11-Jun-22 11:06 AM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I will leave it here, in case I need to go back, or if somebody prefers to build here


[12-Jun-22 10:18 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Anyone have UTS available? I need 8, only see 7 on CX


[12-Jun-22 10:20 PM] churavis#0000
I have the materials to make one on Deimos, it would be done in 10.5h


[12-Jun-22 10:21 PM] yjhasaday#0000
Okay, let's give it until morning to see if anyone has some first - thanks though!


[12-Jun-22 10:24 PM] churavis#0000
I'll be surprised, UTS is only really used for HQ upgrades and ART upkeep


[12-Jun-22 10:27 PM] churavis#0000
It's not really something you keep in stock


[12-Jun-22 11:28 PM] bitcoin_ape#0000
I have 6 UTS on Phobos from some botched trade months ago


[13-Jun-22 01:40 AM] allocater#0000
UTS production seems to have stopped since a month ago. the MM dumps are no longer happening

Is this still available? I am 5 UTS short from my HQ upgrade


[17-Jun-22 09:11 AM] churavis#0000
I make UTS if you need

[17-Jun-22 09:12 AM] jackinabox86#0000
would take me a bit to get mats, but easy enough


[17-Jun-22 09:14 AM] churavis#0000
I've got 1 in stock on Deimos and can ship back the 5 I have on the CX as I have a ship leaving Ant for Deimos in a few hours


[17-Jun-22 09:26 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Oh if you could, that wuold be amazing! I have a ship on its way to Nike, then it is running fuel to Deimos so I should land at about the same time as you!


[17-Jun-22 09:26 AM] yjhasaday#0000
What's your price? I'll post the ad now


[17-Jun-22 09:28 AM] churavis#0000
2250 is fine


[17-Jun-22 09:30 AM] yjhasaday#0000
Alright, ad is up - thanks a bunch! I gave 3 days, that should be plenty of time eh?


[17-Jun-22 09:32 AM] churavis#0000
That's plenty, do you have an exact estimate for when you ship will be on Deimos or when you wanted it to leave with the UTS?


[17-Jun-22 09:35 AM] yjhasaday#0000
No rush, I don't mind if my ship waits a bit on Deimos - it is only an hour from Nike so I would think I'll arrive there before you. But no need to notch up the fuel slider, this HQ upgrade isn't urgent (I just want the extra queue slot lol)


[17-Jun-22 09:36 AM] churavis#0000
Yeah, those extra queue slots would be super useful right now


[21-Jun-22 11:01 AM] insensless72#0000

Question. I see a weird 5% Electronics bonus on my HQ screen. Next HQ upgrade brings that to 7.5%. What is that from, exactly? Deimos isn't an electronics world, nor do I do electronics. Is this something I'm supposed to manage via settings, or just random?


[28-Dec-22 06:05 AM] rune_242#0000
it's because you're HQ is in antares


[28-Dec-22 06:06 AM] xenoxerarch#0000
Its on Deimos, specifically. Is there some sort of system or sector bonus then?


[28-Dec-22 06:07 AM] rune_242#0000

Looking to buy an AAR, BMF and BWS. (nike or ant is great) Or is this better in orders now?


[30-Sep-23 03:02 PM] archielvahr#0000
Send me contracts, I have some materials like that for free on Nike as long as you have HQ level 23 or lower 😄


[30-Sep-23 03:02 PM] pateirn#0000
It is just slightly lower than that 😂


[30-Sep-23 03:02 PM] pateirn#0000
thank you 🙂


[16-Oct-23 06:17 PM] higgsy#0000
Anyone got 2 ADS?


[17-Oct-23 01:37 PM] allocater#0000
yes, ANT, 130k/u


[17-Oct-23 07:15 PM] tuffyless#0000
Archiel ... sent you a contd to buy 6 COM @ 120k.
Whenever you can fill; am prepping for 2 HQ upgrades.


[17-Oct-23 07:15 PM] tuffyless#0000
6 ADS and 6 LOG next when I got more mullah 🙂


[17-Oct-23 08:37 PM] archielvahr#0000
Will have those by tomorrow morning 😄


[17-Oct-23 08:38 PM] archielvahr#0000
just gotta shuffle them around from different planets


[17-Oct-23 08:47 PM] tuffyless#0000
Would you prefer the ADS & LOG contds when they come on Heph or ANT?


[17-Oct-23 08:49 PM] tuffyless#0000
or should I goto allocater for the ADS, say next week?


[17-Oct-23 08:53 PM] archielvahr#0000
ANT is probably best, most of my stuff ends up there. By sometime tomorrow I'll have 6 ADS and 6 LOG on ANT too


[17-Oct-23 08:55 PM] tuffyless#0000
awesome, i gotta figure out what to put up for sell at the yard sale.

Need 4 AAR, 4 RDE for lvl 11


[17-Nov-23 04:00 PM] churavis#0000
I have the RDE and  2 AAR on Nike, plenty on Heph


[19-Nov-23 10:28 AM] mrsmith33#0000
Do you happen to have 4 AARs for me?


[19-Nov-23 11:46 AM] archielvahr#0000
I am out of AARs now, it's the one I make the least frequently. I will queue some up but someone else in the corp can probably get you them sooner

I got 37 AAR on Phobos

That's fine, I've got 2 on Nike and 2 more on ANT


[19-Nov-23 11:50 AM] churavis#0000
I can have the other 2 on Nike within a day or you can transport them yourself


[22-Nov-23 08:57 AM] churavis#0000
Did you get the AAR you need? I've got all 4 on Nike now


[22-Nov-23 08:57 AM] mrsmith33#0000

You definitely won't find STS and BR2 for 125k and 900k anywhere else. They are on ANT, however


[19-Jan-24 11:48 AM] donmega1983#0000
I still have to save some money for the bridge.

Can you give me your name in game?


[19-Jan-24 11:49 AM] churavis#0000
You're suppose to set your nickname for this server as your in-game player name and company


[19-Jan-24 11:56 AM] donmega1983#0000
Better ?


[19-Jan-24 11:57 AM] churavis#0000
You'll want to follow the same format as everyone else:
Playername | Companyname


[19-Jan-24 11:58 AM] donmega1983#0000
Okay


[19-Jan-24 12:00 PM] donmega1983#0000
You have a mistake in your nickname.
in game you are written with 2xii


[19-Jan-24 12:00 PM] donmega1983#0000
is that wrong ?


[19-Jan-24 12:01 PM] churavis#0000
That's what my player name originally was going to be but it was taken or something, I don't remember


[19-Jan-24 12:04 PM] donmega1983#0000
do you still have 30 ZIR?


[19-Jan-24 12:16 PM] archielvahr#0000
I have 30 ZR (not ZIR) available at 7000/u on ANT. I don't have any ZIR ore though


[19-Jan-24 12:17 PM] donmega1983#0000
then I take 15 ZR.


[19-Jan-24 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Those two are both to etherwind, can you resend them on ANT?


[19-Jan-24 12:19 PM] archielvahr#0000
Or if you really want them on etherwind I could ship them


[19-Jan-24 12:20 PM] donmega1983#0000
That would be nice if you could bring it to me.

I still need the following:

1x NV2
3x WAI


[19-Jan-24 12:22 PM] donmega1983#0000
if you still have room in the ship. I can always use water on Etherwind


[19-Jan-24 12:22 PM] churavis#0000
Do you remember what I said about us being an ANT corp? It's going to be hard to get stuff we sell to you or stuff you want to sell to us if you're closest base is Etherwind


[19-Jan-24 12:23 PM] churavis#0000
Also, why do you need NV2 when I can sell you BR2


[19-Jan-24 12:24 PM] donmega1983#0000
I'm still up

Proxion
Gibsion
Giedi Prime
Nemesis
XH-083c


[19-Jan-24 12:26 PM] archielvahr#0000
So I'll ship these to etherwind, but if you aren't based in ANT, I don't think OOG will be a good fit for you. We can't really support a player or get support from someone outside of ANT. And we generally do our transactions in AIC so new players won't have/want CIS.

[19-Jan-24 12:28 PM] archielvahr#0000
Maybe you could check out AHI  or another Castillo-Ito Mercantile corp... like KAWA


[19-Jan-24 12:28 PM] donmega1983#0000
That's certainly not bad if I buy the br2 from you. Otherwise it will take me too long.

Can you make me a price for a CQL ?


[19-Jan-24 12:29 PM] churavis#0000
I have CQL on ANT, the corp price is 900k

Im on a mission to buy HQ L25 a-FAB's instead of taking the time to produce them all.

To that end, Im auctioning off much of my overstock to buy those a-FAB's.
https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1085624056562335755.

I have no idea what corp price is for some of this stuff.
So I set prices at better than CX.
If youre interested in something that isnt typically auctioned here but the price is obnoxious, lmk!

I'll circle back later to order a-FAB's ... basically am trading Electronics + Other Stuff for the FAB's. 🙂

[09-Jun-24 03:15 PM] katinga#0000
but a stack makes me think of things flopped on top of one another.  cubes are more structural


[09-Jun-24 03:18 PM] churavis#0000
Place a layer of atoms in a square shape, then put another layer of square shaped atoms on top of the first, then repeat until you have as many layers of square atoms as the atoms are long and then boom, a cube.

This should give me enough permits to get ALO flowing on Nascent, get a smelting base up for the ALO, and setup Nike to commence bfab/lfab production.

Is level 25 last one in HQ upgrades?


[31-Jul-24 10:25 AM] timomurbekov#0000
How much bases it allows to own?


[31-Jul-24 10:26 AM] sidepipe#0000
I don’t think there’s a limit on HQ upgrades. They just get increasingly expensive. You get one permit per base upgrade 🙂


[31-Jul-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000
lvl 46?


[31-Jul-24 10:26 AM] marat_sh#0000

I see, nice! Thanks!

I think 46 is the highest anyone’s gotten, but I believe it can go higher


[31-Jul-24 10:27 AM] marat_sh#0000

[23-Aug-24 08:44 AM] archielvahr#0000
I feel like the bulk upgrades are the best. You can make a whole chain all at once if you want


[23-Aug-24 09:02 AM] akyantor#0000
I’ve fully mapped out the AWH plan now so just cranking through it


[23-Aug-24 09:02 AM] akyantor#0000
I’ve dropped 3 bases, fourth is on the way.


[23-Aug-24 09:03 AM] akyantor#0000
I’m mostly limited by logistics capacity and waiting for each proceeding base in the chain having enough time to build up a buffer of material to start up the next. 😉


[23-Aug-24 09:04 AM] akyantor#0000
I suspect by the time I’m done I’ll need to buy a new ship to stop the logistics being a pain.


[23-Aug-24 09:24 AM] archielvahr#0000
I was waiting for 5 ships before advertising, but I have two of the OOG standard 2ks available on Heph


[23-Aug-24 09:24 AM] akyantor#0000
I'm not ready yet. 🙂

Is that offer open to everyone? I’ve been wanting to part out an LCB with all the shields for semi-regular service out to OS-099


[23-Aug-24 09:29 AM] sidepipe#0000
But I also don’t mind going through the regular ship-building process. I’m just lazy 😁


[23-Aug-24 09:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah I can send you one if you want!


[23-Aug-24 09:39 AM] archielvahr#0000
I will redo all the prices so it should go from the 6.28m to I think 5,864,820


[23-Aug-24 09:44 AM] sidepipe#0000
well, let me take a look at what parts I need for the shiny new ship. I've got HYR and stuff, so I wouldn't need all the parts if that works for you


[23-Aug-24 09:46 AM] sidepipe#0000
but like I said, not a problem if you prefer to keep the kits whole - i can just sell the parts back to the next person that's building a ship 😄


[23-Aug-24 11:10 AM] archielvahr#0000
Yeah that works. If it's a HYR and it needs a CQL/BR2.. I have one CQL but no extra BR2s, so there might be gaps for that ship


[23-Aug-24 11:10 AM] .urpalhal#0000

I realised after posting the 18->19 that it was a cheaper jump to 20, so may as well do both at the same time. 🙂

@akyantor I'm saving up my supply foy my next hq upgrade, but there are some afabs here:  https://discord.com/channels/854795108720443393/1085624056562335755/1301424472670339074


[31-Oct-24 12:23 PM] akyantor#0000
No prob, I suspect I'll need to go to market for some of them. The downsides of diverting down the shipbuilding route rather than my original plan to do afabs. *I only ever got as far as making my own supply of bfabs/lfabs.* 😛


[31-Oct-24 12:23 PM] akyantor#0000
I may start looking at it again now that I've AWP/AHP up and running.

There are certainly day's that I'm tempted to buy another permit. But free cash is the lubricant that allows so many other things to happen smoothly.
